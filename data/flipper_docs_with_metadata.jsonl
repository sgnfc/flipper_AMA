{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: 4 Square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 4 Square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten by Tim Meighan\n\n\n\"4 Square\" was released by D. Gottlieb & Co. in 1971.\nMore information is available from the\nInternet Pinball Database.\n\nGAME ELEMENTS\n\nThe 4 Square playfield includes two sets of targets and three sets\nof rollovers, with each set consisting of four items.  Each item\nin a given set has a corresponding indicator light marked with a\nunique number value: 1, 2, 3, or  4.  The upper central area of the\nplayfield also contains three pop bumpers arranged in a triangle\nconfiguration.  There are also two kicking rubber islands located\nalong each side just above the flippers.  The lower central portion\nof the playfield is wide open and contains four rows of sequence\nindicator lights, with each row consisting of 4 lights numbered\nfrom 1 to 4.\n\nSCORING\n\nAll rollovers and targets score 50 points.  During the game, certain\nsets of targets and rollovers may be increased in value to score\n200 points instead of 50 points, as explained below.  Rollover and\ntarget scoring occurs whether the item is lit or not.  The two\nkicking rubbers score 1 point.  The left and right pop bumpers score\n1 point when unlit and 10 points when lit.  The central pop bumper\nscores 10 points when unlit and 100 points when lit.  The three\nbumpers are never all lit at the same time.  The bumpers alternate\nbetween having both 10 point bumpers lit and the 100 point bumper\nout, or the 100 point bumper lit and both 10 point bumpers out.\nThis alternation occurs when 1 point is scored.  Therefore, the\nbumpers will alternate when either kicking rubber is hit or when\neither 10 point bumper is hit when not lit.  Note, however, that\nonce the 10 point bumpers are lit all three bumpers are scoring 10\npoints so none of the bumpers can cause the lights to alternate\nagain.  In this situation, the player must hit a kicking rubber to\nget the bumper lights to switch back so that the 100 point bumper\nlights up and the 10 point bumpers go out.\n\nSEQUENCE FEATURE\n\nAt the start of a game, all sequence indicator lights are out and\nall target and rollover indicator lights are lit.  The basic idea\nof the game is to complete as many sequences as possible (starting\nwith the first sequence) by hitting the 1, 2, 3 and 4 targets or\nrollovers.  When any lit target or rollover is made, the indicators\nof all like-numbered items go out and the corresponding number is\nspotted (lit) in the row of the first sequence.  Numbers can be\nmade in any order.   When all four numbers in the first sequence\nare made, 500 points are scored and all targets and rollovers reset,\nlighting up again.   This same action is repeated to complete the\nsecond, third, and fourth sequences in order, with a 500 point bonus\nbeing scored each time a sequence is completed.  Once the fourth\nsequence is completed, the targets and rollovers do not reset - in\nother words, they do not light up again.  However, they do continue\nto register their current score value.\n\nFEATURE SCORE INCREASE AND SPECIAL SCORING\n\nAfter the first sequence is completed, the top rollovers score 200\npoints.  After the second sequence is completed, the yellow targets\nin the upper area of the playfield score 200 points.  After the\nthird sequence is completed, the green targets in the lower area\nof the playfield score 200 points.  After the fourth sequence is\ncompleted, the green targets light occasionally for special.  The\nspecials for all four green targets light up together and go out\ntogether.  They light whenever the 100 point bumper is lit.  In\nother words, they are tied to the same alternator sequence as\ndescribed for the bumpers.  As explained above, this means that the\nonly way to light the specials (if they are out) is to bounce the\nball off one of the kicking rubbers.  Hitting any green target when\nlit for special scores a special only (no score).  Each special\nawards one free game (replay).\n\nREPLAYS FOR HIGH SCORES\n\nOne replay is scored for achieving the each of the following high\nscores: 5100; 6300; 7500; 8700.\n\nTILT\n\nA tilt ends the game and causes ALL playfield lamps to go out.\n\nMAXIMUM CREDITS\n\nAll Gottlieb wedgeheads were factory-set to allow a maximum of 15\ncredits to be registered on the replay unit.  While this could be\nadjusted by the operator, it was extremely rare for anyone to change\nit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "4 Square", "manufacturer": "D.

No major\nchanges have been made from the previous version, although\nthere is more detailed information about a few things, including\npreliminary information about TAF Gold,\nthe 1994 collector's edition of the game that has\nbeen produced.\n Comments and suggestions are always welcome. You can send\ne-mail to gt6139a@prism.gatech.edu\nCredit to those people who have contributed in some way to\nthis guide appears at the end.\n These rules describe play on normal default settings and\non machines without broken diverters or faulty switches. See\nthe section on \"Defaults\" for a listing of defaults and operator-settable\noptions. See your operator if anything's broken :-)\n This is a special version of this rulesheet formatted especially\nfor the World Wide Web.

Insert coins into the machine\nto accumulate credits. The display will show the number of credits\nyou've put on the game. Press Start once for each player in\nthe game; you may play up to four players at once, and you may\nadd players until the beginning of ball 2. Do not press Start\nthereafter until all players have finished their games; otherwise,\nall players' games will be aborted and a new, one-player game\nwill start.\n On the newer Addams Family Gold Edition,\nyou may buy an extra ball at the end of the game for 1 credit.\nAll game features and scores resume as they were at the end\nof the game.\n\nGeneral Playfield Description and Basic Rules\n\nThis section contains the basic game rules, shot by shot. Specific\nrules about timed rounds, multiball, and other major game features\nwill come later.\n\nMillion Plus\nRamp (Side Ramp):\nEach left ramp shot scores 1M, 2M, 3M,\netc. up to a maximum of 10M*; this value resets at the beginning\nof each ball. Each shot also lights a letter in THING if THING\nhas not yet been completed, spots the first unlit GRAVE target,\nlights the electric chair, and feeds the ball (with a properly\nworking diverter) to Thing's Flipper. This ramp is also used\nto collect Stars when lit via the left loop, and to score Super\nJackpots during multiball. This ramp has a gate which scores\n5130 points in both directions and loudly fires the ramp diverter.\n\nBear Kick Ramp\n(Center Ramp):\nEach center ramp shot awards 1 Bear Kick\n(2 when lit via the near left inlane), lights the Electric Chair\nif it is not lit, and returns the ball down the right inlane.\nWhen Thing Flips is lit, it sends the ball to Thing's flipper\ninstead. Extra balls and free mansion rooms are awarded at various\nnumbers of bear kicks. This ramp has a gate which scores 5130\npoints in both directions. It is also the \"V\" grave target.\nSee \"Bear Kicks\".\n\nElectric Chair\n(Left Sinkhole/Kickout):\nLocated just above the left flipper. When\nthe yellow lamp is lit, it awards the currently flashing Mansion\nRoom and kicks the ball back out, hopefully to the left flipper.\nWhen the red lamp is lit, it begins Multi-Ball(TM). The right\ninlane lights the chair for a mansion room temporarily; either\nthe center ramp or the left ramp lights it permanently. On normal\nsettings, the Electric Chair is lit at the beginning of each\nball. (Note: for the remainder of the rules sheet, to say that\nthe \"electric chair is lit\" means that the yellow lamp above\nthe electric chair is lit.)\n\nSwamp Kickout\n(Right Sinkhole/Kickout):\nAwards mansion rooms whenever the Electric\nChair ordinarily would (i.e. the yellow lamp is lit). Kicks\nthe ball back out, hopefully to the right flipper. This shot\nis also the \"E\" target in GRAVE. Shots to the vault, Thing's\nbox, and the swamp are fed here.\n\nSwamp (Side\nWide Sinkhole):\nLocated along the right side of the playfield,\njust below the upper right flipper. Scores the Graveyard Value\nduring normal play, or five times the Graveyard Value when lit\nby sending the ball through the opto just below the mini-flipper.\nThe swamp locks balls when lit. Balls exit the swamp through\nthe swamp kickout.\n\nTrain Wreck\nTarget (Back Left Corner Target):\nThis shot is most easily made from the\nupper right flipper. Located to the right of the Million Plus\nRamp, it scores 1M ordinarily; at certain levels, it scores\n5M and a \"Train Wreck\". Each Train Wreck prevents the Graveyard\nValue from resetting at the beginning of the next ball. On normal\nsettings, four Train Wrecks lights an extra ball. The first\nTrain Wreck takes 2 hits; the second takes 3 hits; and so on\nup to a maximum of 6 hits per train wreck.\n\nGraveyard Jet Bumpers:\nAdvances the Graveyard Value by 10K for unlit bumpers, 20K for\nlit bumpers, and 30K for flashing bumpers. Bumpers are advanced\nby any of the unlit GRAVE targets (see below). The Graveyard\nvalue is initially 1M at the beginning of each ball (unless\nit has been held by a Train Wreck), and increases to a maximum\nof 4M. Each jet bumper hit also changes the currently flashing\nmansion room, moving from left to right first, then bottom to\ntop.\n\nGRAVE targets:\nThe two targets \"G\" and \"R\" are located\njust beneath the jet bumpers. \"A\" is to the left of the Bear\nKicks Ramp. \"V\" is not a standup target but instead is the center\nramp. Likewise, \"E\" is the swamp kickout entrance. Complete\nGRAVE to score the GRAVE bonus of 2M, 3M, 4M, etc. to a maximum\nof 10M for the duration of the game. Each unlit GRAVE target\nalso advances a jet bumper. Any shot to the Million Plus ramp\nwill spot the first unlit GRAVE target.\n\nCousin It (Standup Targets):\nFour standup targets above the Electric Chair most easily hit\nby the upper right flipper, though it can be hit from the lower\nright as well (think Superdog targets from Funhouse); it ordinarily\njust produces a sound effect, \"It, old man!\", and scores 250K\npoints. It is used mainly in the Cousin It round.\n\nBookcase/Vault (Target/Sinkhole):\nThe bookcase is a large target to the right of the bear kicks\nramp. Each bookcase hit spots a letter in GREED; spell GREED\nto open the vault (a sinkhole behind the bookcase). During multiball\nit also adds to the jackpot value. The vault is used to lock\nballs, start Multi-Ball(TM), score Quick Multiball jackpots,\nand relight the Super Jackpot. Two lamps are above the vault\n-- the red lamp is lit whenever multiball start or quick multiball\njackpots are lit; the green lamp is lit whenever the vault is\nopen to lock a ball.\n\nThing Ramp: \nThis is a small metal ramp to the left of the Bear Kicks ramp\nthat feeds the ball to Thing's Eject. There are two lamps above\nthis ramp -- the green lamp indicates that a shot here will\nlock the ball, and the yellow lamp means that \"Thing Bonus\"\nis lit. Thing ramp shots also starts Quick Multiball and Thing\nMultiball, and is lit to collect extra balls.\n\nThing's Eject:\nThis eject is used to score the Skill Shot, and when lit starts\nQuick Multiball or Thing Multiball, restarts Multi-Ball(TM),\nlocks balls, awards THING bonus, or awards extra balls. It is\nusually made during game play by shooting the Thing ramp (see\nabove), but all Thing awards except the skill shot can be collected\nfrom either.\n\nThing (Gimmick Hand):\nYes, Thing himself! He resides in a box and occasionally comes\nout to pick up a ball in Thing's Eject, using a magnet. When\nhe does, the ball is either carried away to the swamp, or Thing\nreappears and releases the ball in the eject.\n\nAdv X Lane\n(Left Loop):\nThis is a lane that runs from the back\nof the jet bumpers around the machine to the upper right flipper.\nWhen \"Adv X\" is lit via the right inlane, shooting this lane\nin either direction advances the bonus multiplier from 1 to\na maximum of 5, valid only for the current ball. Regardless,\nshooting the lane through the bumpers to the upper right flipper\nlights \"Lite Star\" on the Million Plus Ramp. This shot is part\nof all combos. The lit \"Adv X\" times out in a few seconds.\n\nThe Power:\nThe infamous magnets beneath the playfield.\nTwo distinctive Williams lightning bolts in the middle of the\nplayfield and two bright side flashers start up when the Power\nis active. The Power wreaks havoc during the Seance round, when\nMansion Multiball is lit, and during Mansion Multiball.\n\nNear Left Inlane: \nLights \"2 Bear Kicks\" on the center ramp. This award times out\nin a few seconds. It is always lit.\n\nFar Left Inlane: \nLights \"Thing Flips\" on the center ramp when lit; a center ramp\nshot will then be diverted to Thing's flipper for an automatic\nflip towards the swamp. The ramp times out in a few seconds.\nThe inlane is not always lit; see \"Thing Flips\" for more details.\n\nRight Inlane: \nAlways lights \"Adv X\" lane for a few seconds, and if the Electric\nChair is unlit, lights it temporarily for a few seconds.\n\nSwamp Millions Targets: \nWhenever 5X Graveyard is lit, these targets award 1M points\neach. There are three targets, two below and one just above\nthe entrance to the swamp. These targets time out just as 5X\nGraveyard does, and can be hit multiple times until it does.\nThey also help Thing determine how well he's autoflipping.\n\nLeft/Right\nOutlanes:\nWhen lit they score \"Special\" (on normal\nsettings, this is a replay). \"Special\" can only be lit by Touring\nthe Mansion, and normally only one outlane is lit at a time.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nEach time a ball is placed in the plunger lane, you have a chance\nto score the \"Skill Shot\". Hit the ball into Thing's eject for\n2M the first time, then 3M, then 4M, and finally a maximum of\n5M. These values increase for the duration of the game. Balls\nwhich do not land in the eject may circle around into the Jet\nBumpers on a hard shot, miss the eject but still land in that\narea on a close shot, or fall into the swamp on a soft shot.\nIf the ball misses the eject but does not touch any playfield\nswitch, you may safely let it drain and get the ball back. In\nother words, you cannot score zero points on a ball (without\ntilting). The switch in the plunger lane near the swamp and\nthe one just above the plunger do not count since they score\nno points.\n\nBear Kicks\n\nThe number of Bear Kicks accumulates throughout the game. You\nbegin with 1 Bear Kick; each center ramp adds 1 to this value,\nor 2 when the \"2 Bear Kicks\" light has been lit via the near\nleft inlane.\n At a certain level of bear kicks, an extra ball will be\nlit at Thing's Eject. This value normally reflexes according\nto recent game play, but it is usually around 8 or 9. It is\nno less than 6 bear kicks, but apparently it has no maximum.\n At 15, 25, 35, and 45 bear kicks, mansion rooms are spotted.\nThe currently flashing mansion room will be awarded as if\nyou had hit the electric chair or the swamp kickout, and happens\neven if the electric chair is not lit. Mansion rooms are not\nspotted during any of the multiballs; when the multiball finishes,\none more center ramp shot will spot the room. (I'm not sure\nif you can stack mansion spots or not.) If you shoot the lit\nelectric chair or swamp kickout before the room is spotted,\nthat room will be announced before the one that was spotted.\nThe \"?\" panel cannot be spotted by bear kicks.\n Another extra ball is available at 50 bear kicks. This value\ndoes not reflex according to game play, but may be manually\nadjusted by the operator.\n Mansion rooms are also spotted at 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95\nbear kicks.\n On the 99th bear kick, and every bear kick after that, a\n\"Super Bear Kick\" is scored. This is just 5M points, a neat\nanimation showing \"Super Bear Bonus\", and a few booms off\nthe sound board. At this point, no more mansion rooms can\nbe spotted, no more extra balls can be lit via the ramp, and\n\"2 Bear Kicks\" has no effect.\n Each bear kick ramp shot will display the cumulative number\nof bear kicks so far and announce the next level to be reached\nfor an extra ball or mansion room. There is no hint to Super\nBear Kicks before reaching it on the 96th, 97th, and 98th\nbear kicks.\n\nTHING Bonus\n\nMillion Plus ramp shots spot a letter in THING (spelled just\nbeneath your score on the backglass). On normal settings, you\nbegin the game with T-H-I already spotted. Complete THING to\nlight THING Bonus at Thing's Eject (indicated by the yellow\nlamp). THING Bonus starts at 5M the first time, 10M the second\ntime, up to a maximum of 15M. T-H-I is only spotted once (if\nat all). Shooting this award causes Thing to come out of his\nbox, but the ball is set back down into the eject when the animation\nfinishes.\n \"Lite Star\" is lit whenever you shoot the left orbit. It\nremains lit until either it times out in a few seconds or\nyou miss the left ramp shot from the upper right flipper.\nWhen this lamp is lit, the left ramp also lights a Star on\nthe backglass. You can light up to two stars in this fashion,\nand when you collect the Thing Bonus, each star is worth 5M.\nThis value does not increase.\n On very early prototypes, the yellow lamp above the Thing\nRamp was also lit to lock balls since there was no green lamp.\nAlso, early versions carried over the value of the Million\nPlus ramp from ball to ball by default. Wow!\n\nTHING Flips\n\nWhenever Thing Flips is lit in the far left inlane, shots to\nthe bear kick ramp are sent down the left chute to the left\nmini-flipper. Thing will flip the ball for you; hopefully it\nshould land in the swamp most of the time. The machine uses\nartificial intelligence and maintains data from previous flips\nto determine how it's doing. It tries to maintain a success\nrate between 40% and 60% (while normal players usually average\naround a 25% success rate), though on properly maintained machines\nit can be almost perfect all of the time.\n The Swamp Millions targets are lit, so if Thing misses you\nmay be able to pick up some points there. The standard Graveyard\ntimer is still in effect, so Swamp 5X will remain lit for\na few seconds on a miss. If Thing misses but hits some swamp\ntargets, the machine tries to recalculate things for the next\nflip based on the landing of the shot (high or low).\n After three complete misses, the machine will throw out\nall the data and start from scratch. There is also a menu\noption that will let the operator manually throw out all of\nthe data.\n Thing Flips is not lit in the far left inlane during multiball,\nmultiball restart, or Thing Multiball countdown.\n\nMulti-Ball(TM)\n\nThe first step in getting to multiball is lighting locks. You\nlight locks by spelling G-R-E-E-D (hitting the bookcase the\nappropriate number of times). On your first multiball, the first\nswitch you trigger each ball spots a letter. You can also gain\na \"cheat\" GREED letter by tilting. When G-R-E-E-D is spelled,\nthe bookcase opens and the vault is revealed.\n If the ball happens to go into the vault while the bookcase\nis closed, GREED will automatically be spelled, the bookcase\nwill open instantly, and the first ball is locked. This is\ncalled a \"dirty pool\". I like it.\n For the first multiball, Thing's Eject and the Vault will\nlock your first ball (indicated by the green lamps). Lock\none ball to serve another to the plunger, unless no balls\nare in the trough, in which case one will be kicked out from\nthe Swamp Kickout. You may lock this second ball in Thing's\nEject, the Vault, or the Swamp. Locking two balls lights both\nthe Electric Chair and the Vault (the red lamps) to release\nall balls and begin Multi-Ball, and also turns on the Power\nmagnets.\n Once the third ball is locked, all balls will be released.\nThe first and third balls will come from the Swamp Kickout;\nthe second will come from either the Electric Chair or the\nSwamp Kickout, depending on where the last ball was locked.\n The initial jackpot value is 10M. Shoot the Train Wreck\ntarget to collect the Jackpot. Shoot the Million Plus Ramp\nto score the Super Jackpot (for the first multiball, this\nis a Double Jackpot.) After collecting a Jackpot or Super\nJackpot, the vault will open; shoot a ball in the vault to\nrelight the Super Jackpot.\n During multiball, bookcase hits and center ramp shots add\n1M to the jackpot, up to its maximum value of 25M. By default\nthe jackpot value increases until it is awarded, between multiballs\nand multiball restarts. Once the jackpot is collected, the\njackpot value resets to 10M. You can continue to collect Super\nJackpots as long as you can keep two balls in play.\n If you fail to collect a Jackpot, you can restart multiball\nby shooting Thing's Eject within 20 seconds. During this time\nno mansion rooms or stars can be collected, Thing Flips is\nnot lit, and all center ramp shots will be sent to the right\nflipper. The Power is not active during multiball restart.\n Restart is a two-ball multiball, and begins immediately\nafter plunging the second ball into play. The skill shot here\ncan set up a pretty easy shot at the Train Wreck target and\nthe Left Ramp. Both the Jackpot and Super Jackpot are lit\nafter the restart. However, if you can't hit Thing's Eject,\nwell, \"sorry old man\", multiball ends. There is only one restart\nper multiball.\n Mansion rooms, Stars, Swamp 5X, and Thing Flips cannot be\ncollected during this and any other multiballs.\n For the second and subsequent multiballs on normal settings,\nyou must spell GREED via five bookcase hits, and only the\nVault will lock balls one and two. The third can be locked\nin the electric chair or the vault on the second multiball,\nbut only the Vault will be able to lock ball three to start\nthe third multiball. Super Jackpot is three times the base\nJackpot value for all but the first multiball.\n In a multi-player game, it is possible for one player to\n\"unlock\" another player's locked balls. For each unlock, the\nswamp will be lit to relock the ball. This is regardless of\ndifficulty settings or which level of multiball you are playing.\nThe ball can be easily locked again just by plunging softly\nso that the ball falls right into the swamp from the plunger\nlane; it's a nice fix to the \"stolen balls\" problem common\nin manual plunger games.\n\nMansion Rooms\n\nThere are 13 rooms in the Addams' mansion that can be collected\nby shooting either the electric chair or the swamp kickout when\nthe yellow lamp is lit. The chair is normally lit at the beginning\nof each ball, and is relit by shooting either the left or center\nramp.\n The next mansion room to be awarded will be flashing; rooms\nthat have already been awarded will be solidly lit. The jet\nbumpers change the currently flashing room. The last mansion\nroom, denoted by \"?\", is only available after all of the other\n12 have been collected.\n At the beginning of the game, and after the mansion is reset\nbecause you completed all of the rooms, either \"Mamushka\"\nor \"Cousin It\" will be the currently flashing room.\n The total number of mansion rooms collected over the course\nof the game is counted and contributes to your end of ball\nbonus. Unlike Bear Kicks, you start the game with zero mansion\nrooms.\n Mansion rooms can also be spotted (i.e. awarded for free)\nby hitting the bear kick ramp enough times; see \"Bear Kicks\".\n When the twelve rooms have been collected, the Question\nMark is lit in the Attic. Collecting the \"?\" starts \"Tour\nthe Mansion\" (see below). You do not have to relight the electric\nchair/swamp kickout via the ramps or the right inlane in order\nto collect this award. You can't spot \"?\" via Bear Kicks;\nsurpassing a level that would normally award a mansion room\njust wastes that opportunity whenever \"?\" is the only room\nleft.\n Each mansion room is described in more detail below.\n\nMansion: 3 Million\nAwards 3 million, and on normal settings, spots the 6M mansion\nroom if it has not yet been collected. For the purposes of end-of-ball\nbonus, the spotting of the 6M panel by this award is not considered\nto be an earned mansion room.\n In \"The Addams' Family Gold Edition\", this panel has been\nreplaced by Pugsley and Wednesday's Trap Door. See the section\ncalled Metacommentary for more information about TAF\nGold.\n\nMansion: Graveyard at Max\n Advances all jet bumpers to flashing status; each jet now\nadvances the Graveyard value by 30K until the end of the current\nball. At the beginning of the next ball, all jet bumpers will\nreturn to unlit status.\n I'm not sure if this award affects the Grave targets at\nall, but the normal way to advance jet bumpers is by hitting\nGrave targets.\n\nMansion: Hit Cousin It\nThis is a 20 second timed round, during which all targets score\n200K. Each hit to Cousin It, however, increases the target value\nby 50K, and scores 2M points.\n The timer used in this and all other timed rounds will stop\nwhenever any ball in play is in an eject or a tunnel. This\nmeans that rounds which continue into regular multiball tend\nto last a lot longer than 20 or even 30 seconds. It will also\nstop temporarily during a ball search but then restarts again.\n Also, the target value is scored for every switch tripped,\nso the ramps and sinkhole shots will always trip more than\none switch.\n Your Cousin It bonus is initially credited with 1M points\nat the start of the round.\n\nMansion: The\nMamushka\nThis is a 20 second timed round during\nwhich all targets score 250K. There is no way to increase the\ntarget value.\n Your Mamushka bonus is initially credited with 1M points\nat the start of the round.\n\nMansion: 6 Million\nAwards 6 million points. On normal difficulty settings, it also\nspots the 3M mansion room if it has not yet been awarded.\n\nMansion: Quick Multiball\nLights Quick Multiball at Thing's Eject. This remains lit until\nit is collected (by default). You cannot lock balls at Thing's\nEject or collect the Thing Bonus while it is lit. It becomes\nunavailable temporarily during any multiball or multiball restart.\n Shoot Thing's Eject to begin. Thing will take the ball and\nsend it to the swamp kickout; another ball will be served\nto the plunger unless two balls have been locked, in which\ncase it will come from the Swamp Kickout. During Quick Multiball,\nthe Vault will be open and will score 5M points. This value\nincreases by 1M each time \"Vault Millions\" is collected or\nthe center ramp is hit, up to a maximum value of 10M.\n There may be some problems with this round or Thing Multiball\nwhenever Tunnel Hunt is running; see \"Mansion: Tunnel Hunt\".\n If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball\nis lit, Thing Multiball only will be started instead.\n\nMansion: Tunnel Hunt\nThis is a 20 second timed round in which you should shoot the\nthree tunnel shots: the electric chair, the swamp (or swamp\nkickout), and the vault. They may be shot in any order. The\nfirst scores 5M, the second is worth 10M, and the third is worth\n15M.\n The round starts with the quote \"Look darling, just what\nwe've been searching for\" by Morticia. The quotes for each\ntunnel searched are: 1st tunnel: \"Perhaps it's in here.\"\n 2nd tunnel: \"There it is.\"\n 3rd tunnel: \"Just what we've been searching for.\"\n If the electric chair is lit, hitting the electric chair\nduring Tunnel Hunt will also award another mansion room. (Same\ngoes for the swamp kickout.)\n If the vault was previously lit for lock, you will not be\nable to lock balls during Tunnel Hunt. It will relight at\nthe end of the round. Once the vault has been hit, it will\nclose. If Quick Multiball or Thing Multiball is running, it\nmay or may not close (hopefully it won't, of course).\n Plunging a ball into the swamp while Tunnel Hunt is running\ndoes not give credit for the tunnel. Hitting the bookcase\nduring Tunnel Hunt when the vault should be open will not\nconvince the game to open it.\n\nMansion: Seance\nThis is a 20 second timed round during which the next three\nramp shots (either Million Plus or Bear Kick ramp) will score\n5M, 10M, and 15M each. The Power magnets are enabled throughout\nthe round.\n The round starts with Gomez saying \"Seance ... knock three\ntimes.\" Successive ramp shots will then producing one, two,\nor three knocking sounds followed by Gomez saying \"Once\",\n\"Twice\", or \"Thrice ... well done.\"\n Bear Kick ramps will always feed to Thing's mini-flipper,\nexcept when Thing Multiball is counting down. Thing Flips\nis still possible during Seance.\n\n\nMansion:\n9 Million\nAwards 9 million points. Wow.\n\nMansion: Thing\nMultiball\nMuch like Quick Multiball, this is a count-down\naward lit at Thing's Eject. Hitting this immediately scores\n15M, but this value counts down quickly to 3M before it expires.\nThere is a short grace period once the timer reaches 3M. Shoot\nThing's Eject to score the value immediately and set the value\nof the vault during Thing Multiball. During the countdown, *all*\nbear kick shots will return the ball to the right inlane, no\nmatter what. Thing Flips inlane is not lit during the countdown\nor the actual multiball.\n A second ball is sent to the plunger if possible (see \"Quick\nMultiball\" for details if this is not the case), and multi-ball\nplay begins as soon as it is plunged, in the same manner as\nQuick Multiball. However, the value of the vault is fixed\nand cannot be increased.\n If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball\nis lit, Thing Multiball will be started instead, and Quick\nMultiball cannot be collected until Thing Multiball ends.\n If you have spotted Thing Multiball by bear kicks, you can\nshoot Thing before the mansion fanfare finishes. However,\nyou will NOT be awarded the instant 15M points. The vault\nvalue is still fixed to 15M and an otherwise normal Thing\nMultiball continues.\n\nMansion: Raise the Dead\nThis award starts a 30 second timed round in which hits to the\njet bumpers add to your Raise the Dead bonus. The bumpers will\nall flash, even though this award has nothing to do with the\nnormal status of the jets (unlit, lit, and flashing). Shoot\neach bumper four times to score 3M points; each bumper hit is\nalso worth 100K also. The Raise the Dead bonus begins at 2M.\n Whenever one of the bumpers is hit for the fourth time,\nit becomes solidly lit. The dot matrix will show you a grave\nfor each of the bumpers and how many more times each bumper\nneeds to be hit.\n When all bumpers have been hit four times, the round ends\nimmediately. You can, however, continue to collect 100K per\nhit for bumpers which have already been hit four times until\nthe round is over.\n\nMansion: Extra Ball\nThis mansion room simply lights an Extra Ball at Thing's Eject.\nUnder normal settings, it will remain lit until collected.\n\nTour the Mansion\n\nWhenever the 12th mansion award has been collected or started,\nthe electric chair will be re-lit automatically and the \"?\"\nwill be flashing. Shooting the chair (or swamp kickout, of course)\nwill start \"Tour the Mansion\", which is as follows:\n All of the mansion rooms become unlit. Basically, Tour the\nMansion has a lot in common with Whirlwind in that the mega-award\nis simply to re-award everything (almost everything, actually).\n 50 million points is awarded (as clearly indicated by Gomez).\nThe 3M, 6M, and 9M rooms light up at this point.\n \"Special\" is lit in the outlanes. By default, these outlanes\nare \"hard\", meaning that only one of them is lit at a time,\nchanging whenever a slingshot is hit. Quick Multiball lights\nup now, even though it has nothing to do with Specials.\n The Graveyard is maximized (all jet bumpers flash). The\ncorresponding room is lit.\n An extra ball is lit at Thing's Eject, and the EB room is\nlit. This is a temporary extra ball, which must be collected\nbefore you drain or it will go away.\n Each of the remaining room rounds is started one at a time,\nin the following order: Mamushka, Hit Cousin It, Seance, Tunnel\nHunt, Raise the Dead, and Thing Multiball. The first five\nare all timed and end as soon as the timer expires or you\ndrain. Thing Multiball ends if you fail to start the round\n(as usual by shooting Thing's Eject), or if you do start two-ball\nplay, when you return to one ball.\n Any rounds running when the Tour is started continue to\nrun during the Tour. It is extremely distressing if you have\nto contend with the Power during the Tour because you had\nstarted the Seance round before starting the Tour.\n If you reach a number of bear kicks that would ordinarily\nspot a mansion room while Touring, that free room is wasted.\nIt does not carry over to the next mansion, nor does it affect\nTour the Mansion in any way.\n If you complete all of the above, the Tour ends quietly.\nFor the remainder of that ball, you will be unable to collect\nmansion awards.\n The extra ball lit by Touring is \"hard\" by default; it must\nbe collected on that ball or it will disappear. Likewise,\n\"Special\" will also be unavailable after the ball ends.\n Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead bonuses collected\nbefore Touring carry over into the Tour, i.e. your base totals\nfor the round are what you had before you toured, plus the\n1M or 2M normally given for starting the round.\n Previous versions of this guide said that \"?\" isn't really\nconsidered a mansion room since it isn't added to the count\nas part of your end- of-ball bonus. This is wrong: starting\nTour the Mansion awards one mansion room just like all of\nthe other rooms. Each mansion round played during Tour the\nMansion, however, has no effect on this counter.\n\nEnd of Ball Bonus\n\nBonus is calculated at the end of each ball as follows: 100K\nfor each bear kick, up to the maximum 99.\n 500K for each mansion room, with no apparent limit. The\ndisplay has trouble with values over 99, though.\n The sum of the above is multiplied by the bonus multiplier,\nfrom 1x to 5x.\n Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead totals are added.\n Scoring 20M or more in bonus generates a quote from Gomez:\n\"Who says you can't take it with you?\" However, the quote\nwill not be delivered unless you played at least one of the\ntimed rounds during the ball.\n\nCombos\n\nThere are two 3-way combos, worth 5M each:\n Right inlane, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp\n Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp, Swamp\n And one 4-way combo, worth 10M:\n Bear kick ramp, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus ramp, Swamp\n Scoring the 4-way combo also awards the points for the 3-way\ncombo (since the first 3 of the 4 forms one of the 3-way combos).\nThis makes the 4-way very valuable: 15M + bonus X advanced\n+ at least 1M from the ramp + at least 5M for the 5X graveyard\nvalue + 5M for the Star when you collect Thing Bonus.\n\nDefaults\n\nThe following information was taken from The Addams Family manual,\ncourtesy of Jonathan Deitch (musjndx@gsusgi2.gsu.edu). It is\na list of game features that can be altered by the operator.\nNormally these are left alone, but adjusting the overall difficulty\nof the machine or setting games to 5-balls will change a lot\nof these.\n 1. Extra Ball Percent: desired % of games in which the first\nBear Kick extra ball should be collected. This value is used\ninternally to reflex the number of bear kicks required. Range\nis 15-40% It can also be set to FIXED such that the first\nbear kick extra ball level does not reflex. Default is 25%.\n 2. 1st Bear Kick extra ball level: set 1. to fixed and this\noption will set the number of bear kicks required for the\nfirst extra ball. Default is 8.\n 3. 2nd Bear Kick extra ball level: This value ranges from\n30-99 and does not reflex. Default is 50.\n 4. Train Wreck Extra Ball Available: Default is to award\nextra balls at a certain number of train wrecks.\n 5. Bear Kick EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\n 6. House EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\n 7. Train Wreck EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\n 8. Last Thing Lock: This is the final multiball level on\nwhich Thing will lock balls. Default is for the first multiball\nonly. This value ranges from 0-5.\n 9. Last Swamp Lock: This is the final multiball level on\nwhich the Swamp will light to lock ball two. Default is for\nthe first multiball only. The value ranges from 1-5.\n 10. Last Chair Release: This is the final multiball level\non which the electric chair can be shot to start multiball.\nDefault is for the first and second multiballs. The value\nranges from 0-5.\n 11. Jackpot Carryover: When set this retains the value of\nthe jackpot until it is hit; when off, the jackpot will reset\nat the end of each multiball or multiball restart. Default\nis to carryover jackpots.\n 12. Million Plus Memory: Default is to reset the value of\nthe Million Plus at the end of each ball. Change this and\nscoring would become atrocious.\n 13. Million Plus Maximum: Default upper limit of the Million\nPlus is 10M. This value can range from 5M to 20M.\n 14. Thing Multiball Start: This value can range from 10M\nto 20M. Default starting value of Thing Multiball is 15M.\n 15. Room from Swamp: Default is to award mansion rooms from\nthe swamp kickout.\n 16. Free THING Letters: Up to 5 THING letters can be spotted\nat the beginning of the game. Default is 3.\n 17. Raise the Dead Hits: The number of hits per jet bumper\ncan be set from 3-9. Default is 4.\n 18. Train Wreck Hits: By default, 2 hits are required for\nthe first Train Wreck. This value can range from 2-4. Successive\ntrain wrecks always require 1 more hit up to the maximum of\n6.\n 19. Special Memory: By default, specials disappear at the\nend of the current ball.\n 20. Train Wreck Memory: By default, the train wreck hits\ncount carries over between balls.\n 21. Quick Multiball Memory: By default, Quick Multiball\nwill remain lit between balls until it is hit.\n 22. Tour EB Memory: By default, the Extra Ball lit during\nTour the Mansion will disappear at the end of the current\nball.\n 23. Tour Difficulty. Default is a medium setting, in which\nthe 6M and 3M rooms will spot each other. On the hard setting,\neach must be collected separately.\n\nProblems\n\nWhile this game is perfect in many ways, none is completely\nimmune to problems or failures. Here are some of the more common\nproblems:\n Balls can get stuck inside the swamp, on the swamp, on top\nof Thing's box, on jet bumpers, and on the circular plate\nthat the bookcase sits upon. The machine will perform ball\nsearches until it finds the missing ball -- firing all the\njet bumpers, spinning the vault, etc. *but* it will not fire\nthe swamp kickout if a ball has been locked there at first.\nEventually, if the ball has not been found, it will serve\na new ball in the plunger lane, or if no balls are in the\ntrough, it will try to fire one from the swamp kickout.\n If you tilt, it will end the current ball, but the next\nball won't start until it finds the missing ball(s). The only\nsolution short of removing the stuck ball at this point is\nto power cycle the game and start over unless you have locked\nballs; it will kick out ALL locked balls after two or three\nball searches. However, once these drain, if the ball is still\nlost the problem can easily resurface.\n If you abort the game and start a new one, when pressing\nStart the game will let you know if a pinball is missing and\ntry to find it a couple of times, but eventually it will give\nup and play with what's available. There are only three balls\ninstalled in the machine; it will function even if only one\nis available (though obviously multiball loses its meaning\n:-)\n The only diverter is located in the upper left corner where\nthe two ramps meet. If it gets stuck, you may find all balls\ngoing to the same spot -- either the mini-flipper or the right\ninlane. This may or may not be a \"problem\". I've also heard\nof balls getting lodged back there somehow.\n If the machine decides that there are faulty switches (because\nthey haven't been hit in a while), it will try to compensate.\nIf one of the ramp switches is bad, the other ramp will award\nboth of them. If the bookcase won't open, you can lock balls\nat the Thing Ramp. If Thing can't pick up the ball from the\neject, then it will just remain there. I'm sure that there\nare many more that I haven't seen.\n\nQuotes\n\nSomeone has already taken care of this for me. A list of all\nthe quotes is currently available from the r.g.p. FTP archive\non pinball.cc.cmu.edu,\nas /Quotes/taf.quotes\n\nMusic\n\nThe following is a list of the musical pieces in The Addams\nFamily:\n Addams Theme: Played at the beginning of your first ball\nuntil you plunge the ball into play. Also played during attract\nmode and the explanation of \"Tour the Mansion.\"\n Normal Game Theme: Played during normal game play, when\nno special rounds are active.\n Mamushka Theme: Played during the Mamushka round.\n Cousin It Theme: Played during Cousin It round.\n Tunnel Hunt Theme: Played during Tunnel Hunt round.\n Seance Theme: Hardly music, but played during Seance round.\n Raise the Dead Theme: Played during Raise the Dead round.\n Thing Multiball Countdown Theme\n Quick/Thing Multiball Theme: Played during quick MB rounds.\n Multiball Release Theme: Played while two balls are locked\nand you're trying to lock the third for Multiball.\n Multiball Theme: Played until you score your first jackpot.\n Jackpot Theme: Played after you score a jackpot UNTIL YOU\nEND THAT BALL, even after multiball is over, or until you\nstart multiball again. It's a souped-up version of the Addams\nTheme.\n It's also the Enter Initials Theme.\n Multiball Restart Theme: Played while Thing Multiball restart\nis lit, it's just one particular part of the Addams Theme\nbeing played over and over. The same music is also played\nwhile the features of \"Tour the Mansion\" are being explained.\n\nCows\n\nLike most Bally/Williams pinballs, there are cows in this game\n(or at least images of them). During attract mode, there is\na sequence of flipper button/start presses that will cause the\ncows to come up during attract mode. There is also a sequence\nthat causes the game's credits to appear with rather loud accompaniment.\n Using the notation L=left flipper, R=right flipper, and\nS=start button:\n Cows: 7L, 1S, 14R, 1S, 20L, 1S\n Credits: 13L, 1S, 1R, 1S, 2L, 1S\n These sequences only work for L-1 machines and later, and\nsometimes you may have to power cycle the game to get it to\nwork. Also, there can't be any credits on the game at the\ntime, since hitting the start button would thus begin a game.\n\nMetacommentary\n\nThe Addams Family was released in 1991, and\nwas designed by Pat Lawlor, creator of Whirlwind, Funhouse,\nand later, Twilight Zone and Road Show. It was, of course, inspired\nby the television series of the same name. Since then, it has\nbecome the number one selling pinball of all time, surpassing\nsuch classics as \"Eight Ball Deluxe\".\n To commemorate this noteworthy accomplishment, in the spring\nof 1994 TAF was placed back onto the production line -- 2500\n\"Gold Edition\" machines were made, mostly for collectors and\nnot distribution. There are differences between the new TAF\nGold and the original, such as:\n Gold-colored lockdown bars, jet bumper caps, vaults, and\nThing boxes.\n More quotes have been added; none have been removed.\n A new game feature called \"Cousin It's Lost items\". Some\nof the mansion rooms contain hats, hairbrushes, keys, etc.\nworth bonus points and even extra balls and specials.\n The 3M mansion room has been replaced by \"Pugsley and Wednesday's\nTrap Door\". It scores 3M but serves as a link to another one\nof the mansion rooms. Because of this, it does not automatically\nspot the 6M mansion room anymore.\n For more detailed information on TAF Gold,\nsee Keith Johnson's rulesheet.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis \"Addams Family\" guide has been brought to you by Brian\nDominy (gt6139a@prism.gatech.edu) but with the help of many\nothers.

It is a Pat Lawlor design, who is\nfamous for his other works including Whirlwind, FunHouse, and Twilight Zone.\nThis pin was so popular, it broke the production record of most pins\nmanufactured (of the same type) which was like 22,000 held by former champ\nEight Ball Deluxe (early 1980's).  It is said that the machine that broke the\nrecord was all made up in gold (like gold legs, gold metal around other parts\nof the machine, etc.).  Whereas details of this record-breaking machine are\nsketchy to say the least, these characteristics hold for this new limited\nedition release of TAF.\n\nObviously, most of the parts are not pure gold, but more than likely are\ngold-color painted.  Lots of other parts of the machine (other than the metal\noutside) are also gold-colored:  the vault, the tops of the pop bumpers,\nThing's box...  Each machine of TAF Special Collector's Edition (TAFG, for\nTAF Gold) is numbered (out of supposedly 1000 machines - a very limited run\nindeed) and includes a certificate signed by the members of the design team.\nThe number of the machine is located on a gold plate on the lower right-hand\ncorner of the front of the machine.  FWIW, the machine I've been playing is\n#0959.  :)\n\nWARNING - This guide may contain SPOILERS that you don't really want to know\nabout right away and find out for yourself (the \"?\" of the Mansion comes to\nmind).  Most sections are labelled pretty carefully, so you should be able to\navoid reading that which you don't want to read.  However, I take no\nresponsibility for you finding out stuff you didn't already know.  :)\n\nK = 1,000; M = 1,000,000; B = 1,000,000,000.  The notation \"xM+yM to zM\"\nmeans it starts at xM points, goes up yM points every time it is awarded, but\nnever goes higher than zM points.\n\nEdition Differences\n\nMost people are more than likely familiar with the original version of TAF.\nIn the interest of completeness, though, this will be a guide to the entire\ngame.  This section briefly describes the differences between the old TAF and\nTAFG.\n\n\nCousin It's Hideout  Some rooms in the mansion (it's always random) contain\n        belongings of Cousin It.  Depending on what you find, you are given\n        an award of some sort.  For full details, see the section following\n        the Mansion description.\n\nSuper Seance  There seems to be about a 50% chance than any given time you\n        shoot the Seance Mansion award, you will get a Super Seance instead.\n        See the description in the Mansion section.\n\n3M  The 3M and 6M awards are NOT attached any more.  However, the 3M will\n        give you another room.  See the 3M under the Mansion secion.\n\nMultiball  A couples changes in Multiball rules:  The starting jackpot for\n        Multiball now varies, and Dirty Pool during Multiball will award a\n        Super Jackpot and leave it lit.  See the Multiball section.\n\nLocked balls  Any balls that were locked for Multiball are kicked out of the\n        Swamp automatically at the end of the game now.  It is adjustable,\n        but this is the default behavior.\n\nExtra ball buyin  There is one on TAFG.  It can be set to allow anywhere\n        from 0-99 buyins, and it doesn't matter how many you use because\n        you'll be able to get on the high score chart regardless.\n\nQuotes  There's a load of new quotes in TAFG.  Some are more understandable\n        than others, though.  They don't have any impact on gameplay, it's\n        just that some of them are pretty cool.  :)\n\n\nThere may be other things that differ that we don't know about yet.  Also,\nsome things have not yet been accomplished on TAFG.  In these cases, the\nlimits set forth in TAF (which have been well documented) will be used.  For\nexample, I have not gotten to the maximum value of the Graveyard yet, but in\nTAF it was 4M.  Therefore, I assume that the maximum is 4M for TAFG as well.\nShould anything ever be found to be different, you can bet that it'll be\nchanged in this guide.\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nI'll start at the bottom center and go clockwise around.\n\n\nFlippers  The 2 at the bottom are normal full-length flippers.\n\nLeft slingshot  A normal slingshot.\n\nLeft inlanes  There are 2 of them, both leading to the left flipper.  The\n        left one lights the middle ramp for \"Thing Flips\" for about 8\n        seconds.  The right one lights the middle ramp for 2 Bear Kicks\n        instead of just one for about 4 seconds.\n\nLeft outlane  It can be lit for a Special, but that's about it.\n\nThing flipper  This is a mini-flipper which is used to shoot the Swamp.  The\n        ball can go to this flipper either as one of 2 exits from the\n        Graveyard or from the ramps.  (The left ramp always feeds to the\n        Thing flipper, and the ramp diverter can be opened so that the middle\n        ramp does too.)  When the ball comes down from the ramp or the\n        Graveyard (or if it wanders up far enough from down below), it'll\n        trigger an opto that lights the Swamp.\n\nG and R targets  Located between the 2 exits of the Graveyard (the left loop\n        shot and the Thing flipper lane), these 2 standup targets make up the\n        first 2 letters in Grave.\n\nElectric Chair  This is a kickout hole with a (gold) plastic chair above it.\n        There are 2 lights indicating its status on either side of the chair.\n        The yellow light indicates that a shot to the chair will award the\n        currently flashing Mansion award.  The red light indicates that the\n        chair will start Multiball.  When balls get kicked out, they head\n        towards the middle of the left flipper (usually).\n\nGraveyard  This is the name given to the pop bumper area.  There are 5\n        bumpers here.  Each hit gives some kind of scream or moan or gasp and\n        briefly disturbs the appropiate grave on the display as well as adds\n        to the current Graveyard value.\n\nLeft loop  This is the passage through the Graveyard that goes around the\n        back of the game, feeding to the upper right flipper.  \"Adv. X\" can\n        be lit for this shot by going through the right inlane.  Making this\n        shot also lights the \"light star\" light on the left ramp for about 4\n        seconds.\n\nCousin It  The Cousin It targets are located above and to the right of the\n        Electric Chair, sloping away from a direct shot at them from the\n        bottom right flipper.  Just to the right of the standup targets is a\n        picture of Cousin It.  The only time the targets are used is during\n        the Cousin It round of the Mansion.  Any time you hit the targets\n        will generally get you a random squeal from It.\n\nLeft ramp  This ramp is only directly makable from a upper-right flipper\n        shot.  Any shot to it will always award Million Plus (1M+1M up to\n        10M) and light the next letter in THING.  If \"light star\" is lit (by\n        shooting the left loop first), then you'll also be awarded one of the\n        THING stars.  This is also the Super Jackpot shot during Multiball.\n        It feeds to the Thing flipper.  The first time it is shot each ball\n        you may hear \"Not bad.\" from Gomez sometimes followed by \"I know,\n        darling.\" from Tish.  Other times you'll hear \"Play ball!\"  Also,\n        each shot spots the next unlit letter in GRAVE.\n\nTrain  This is a lane located just above the entrance to the left ramp with\n        a standup target and the end.  Getting a certain number of train hits\n        will award a train wreck.  This is also the Jackpot shot during\n        Multiball.\n\nThing ramp  This is a tiny ramp shootable from the bottom right flipper,\n        though sometimes a weird brick shot from the upper right flipper will\n        also land the ball here.  There are 4 status lights for this ramp.\n        The 2 lights on the playfield are Extra Ball and Multiball.  Above\n        the ramp are a green light which indicates a ball can be locked here\n        for multiball and a yellow light which indicates that you can collect\n        the next THING value.  You can always get the extra ball when it is\n        lit by shooting this ramp, but only 1 of the other 3 things may be\n        collected at a time on any one shot.  The priority of awards is\n        Multiball then lock (green light) then THING award (yellow light).\n        The ball goes down a small lane to the kickout saucer.\n\nA target  This standup target is located between the entrances to the Thing\n        ramp and the middle ramp.  It is part of the Grave targets.\n\nMiddle ramp  Shooting this ramp will add 1 to your \"Bear Kicks.\"  You start\n        the game with 1, and various numbers along the way will give you\n        awards.  An extra ball will light after 6-14 Kicks (self-adjusting)\n        and at 50 Kicks.  Also, every 15+10 Kicks (up to 95) will spot the\n        currently flashing Mansion award (unless it's the \"?\").  This ramp\n        can be lit for 2 Bear Kicks via the right left inlane and/or Thing\n        Flips via the left left inlane.  During Multiball, it adds 1M to the\n        Jackpot.  During Quick Multiball, it adds 1M to the Vault Jackpot.\n        It is also the \"V\" shot in Grave.  Typically, the ball will be fed to\n        the right inlane, though it may go to the Thing flipper if Seance is\n        running or if Thing Flips is lit.\n\n*THING*  This display is located just under the dot matrix display on the\n        backglass.  Every time you shoot the left ramp, the next unlit letter\n        is lit up.  You can light up to both of the stars by shooting the\n        ramp when \"light star\" is lit on the left ramp.  Typically, you'll\n        start the game off with 3 letters, though this is adjustable.  You\n        can still earn stars even if THING is already spelled.  Collect the\n        THING award at the Thing ramp/kickout saucer.\n\nBookcase  This is the big gold block sitting on a gold round turntable.  On\n        it is a sign that says something like \"Spell GREED to light locks.\"\n        Well, that's just what you do.  When the Bookcase is closed (facing\n        you), then shooting it will usually award you the next letter in\n        GREED.  When the bookcase is open, it reveals a shot to the Vault.\n\nVault  This is a hold behind the Bookcase, generally only shootable when the\n        Bookcase is open.  Of course, given the way pinball is, a ball could\n        always wander into it when it isn't open...  Above the Vault are 2\n        status lights.  A green light means that a ball can be locked there\n        for Multiball, and a red light means that that shot will start\n        Multiball OR that it's lit for a Jackpot (during one of the Quick\n        Multiballs) OR that it'll light the Super Jackpot if it isn't lit\n        during Multiball.\n\nKickout saucer  This saucer can get a ball in it in 3 different ways.  It is\n        fed to from the Thing lane (shot by the Thing ramp) and by a slow-\n        moving ball that drops down from the plunger ramp.  Also, a ball that\n        kind of dribbles around the upper right corner may plop into it.\n        Anytime the ball goes into the saucer, whether it was shot from the\n        Thing ramp, plunger lane, or a lucky bounce, whatever was lit at the\n        Thing ramp will be awarded.  For example, you could drain with an\n        extra ball lit, then (presuming it stays lit between balls), get the\n        extra ball off of the skill shot.  Thing will pick up the ball here\n        if a lock, THING, or Multiball is lit.\n\nThing  Thing resides in the gold box that takes up the upper right corner of\n        playfield.  Basically, he's a plastic hand with a magnet on his\n        fingertips that allows him to \"pick up\" balls.  See the kickout\n        saucer description above to find out when he comes out.  For all\n        awards except THING, once he has retreated back into the box, the\n        magnet will deactivate and the ball will follow a path to the Swamp\n        kickout.  If THING was awarded, though, Thing will come back out and\n        put the ball back into the saucer.\n\nRight loop  Shooting the ball around here has no really useful purpose\n        except to get the ball into the Graveyard.  Sometimes during\n        Multiball, the game will get confused and give you Adv. X (the left\n        loop award) if it's lit.\n\nPlunger ramp  The ball travels up this ramp when you launch it with the\n        (manual) plunger.  Just beyond the gate lies an entrance to the Swamp\n        which the ball will go into if not launched very hard.  The skill\n        shot is to get the ball to go just off the end of the ramp into the\n        kickout saucer.  The skill shot is worth 2M+1M to 5M.  You can also\n        plunge the ball very hard and it'll go around the right loop into the\n        Graveyard.  If lock is lit in the Swamp, you can soft plunge the ball\n        and let it fall into there and get credit for the lock.  If you slam\n        the plunger with the palm of your hand with all of your might, the\n        ball will doubtlessly get lodged under the middle ramp, so I don't\n        highly recommend doing this.\n\nUpper-right flipper  A full-length flipper which you can use to hit the left\n        ramp, Train, Cousin It, and the Bookcase.  Various other trick shots\n        are possible, like shooting the Thing ramp, the middle ramp(!), and\n        an open Vault off of Cousin It.  Balls are fed to it from the kickout\n        saucer and the left loop.\n\nSwamp Millions targets  These standup targets are located around the Swamp,\n        1 above and 2 below.  When the Swamp is lit for 5x Graveyard, these\n        targets are also active.  Each one you hit while 5x Graveyard is lit\n        is worth 1M points.  Otherwise, they're not worth very much at all\n        (token points).  You may think of these as consolation points for\n        missing that blasted shot to the Swamp from the Thing flipper, but\n        their real purpose is to let the game know how off Thing was on his\n        calculated shot from \"Thing Flips.\"  If he hits the top target, he\n        waits a little longer, one of the bottom 2, he speeds up a little.\n\nSwamp  When unlit, the Swamp awards the Graveyard value.  When lit for 5x\n        Graveyard, amazingly enough it awards just that.  Lock may also be\n        lit here, and when it is, you can just plunge a ball softly so that\n        it lands there.\n\nSwamp kickout  Any ball that goes into the Swamp from the plunger, Swamp\n        shot, or from Thing will get kicked out here to the right flipper.\n        This is also the \"E\" shot in Grave, though you must actually shoot\n        the kickout itself rather than let a ball get kicked out from it.\n        Shooting the kickout (tricky, because it's all the way on the right\n        of the playfield) will also award you the next Mansion room when the\n        Electric Chair is lit on normal settings, unlighting the Electric\n        Chair.\n\nRight outlane  Same as left...  Special can be lit here, but that's it.\n\nRight inlane  When the ball goes through the right inlane, it lights the\n        left loop for \"Adv. X,\" which is the bonus multiplier for about 5\n        seconds.  For the same length of time, it'll light the Electric Chair\n        temporarily if it is not permanently lit.\n\nRight slingshot  A normal slingshot.\n\nPower  In the middle of the playfield right above the flippers is an area\n        mysteriously marked \"The Power.\"  The Power is active during certain\n        times and is basically 3 spinning magnets that can absolutely wreak\n        havoc with balls on top of the playfield.  This can also lead to some\n        amazingly interesting, funny, and devastating results.  You can tell\n        if The Power is active by whether its light is flashing or not.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are 2 main objectives to TAFG:  Getting Mansion rooms and getting\nMultiball to score Jackpots.  Both the Mansion and Multiball have their own\nsections in this rulesheet.  However, there is also tons of other stuff you\ncan do to score points in this game.  Scoring was pretty high when the\noriginal TAF first came out, but by games of today's standards, TAFG tends to\nbe on the lower side.  On an average machine, the replay will probably hover\naround 100M +/- 20M depending on the machine itself and the ability of the\nlocals, assuming auto-percentaging is on.  The default replay boost is 8M.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nFor the skill shot, try to plunge the ball just hard enough to get it to land\nin the kickout saucer.  The skill shot is worth 2M+1M up to 5M points each\ntime you make it.  You can get the skill shot any time you plunge the ball\nwhen it is served to you by the game to the plunger lane.  If a ball airballs\ninto the plunger lane, you can't get a skill shot.\n\nIf the ball doesn't quite make it up the plunger ramp, then it'll fall into\nthe Swamp.  (\"Don't torture yourself, darling.\" or \"You should know better.\"\nor \"Have a nice swim!\" or \"The primeval ooze.\")  If the lock was lit at the\nSwamp, then the ball gets locked (\"Good thinking!\").\n\nIf the ball goes beyond the kickout saucer but doesn't hit anything AT ALL\n(meaning you have scored 0 points) and drains then you are simply given the\nball back to try again.  Note that the outlanes score points!  This is\napplicable ANY time you are given the ball at the plunger, including the\nstart of Multiballs!  Basically, if your score is still flashing (as opposed\nto being swept off and back on), then you can let it safely go.\n\nTHING\n\nTHING letters are on the backglass.  On normal settings, you start the game\nwith 3 letters (THI).  Every time you shoot the left ramp, you get the next\nletter.  When THING is complete, you may shoot the Thing ramp to get the\nTHING value.  Thing will then come out of his box and pick up the ball (\"No,\nno, no!\" or \"No time for that now, Thing.\").  He'll then come back out of the\nbox and put the ball back into the kickout saucer.  THING is worth 5M the\nfirst time, then 10M, then a maximum of 15M.  For each star you have (up to\n2), you get an additional 5M from the THING value.  You get a star by making\na left loop->left ramp combo (shooting the left ramp when \"light star\" is\nlit).  Therefore, you can get up to 25M from THING at one time.\n\nIf lights are burned out or something, the display will tell you which\nletters you have already gotten when you shoot the left ramp.  Also, it is\nmentioned in the Status Report.\n\nGRAVE Letters\n\nThere are 5 letters scattered over the playfield that spell GRAVE.  The G and\nR are located just to the right of the Thing flipper, the A is just to the\nleft of the middle ramp, the V is the middle ramp, and the E is the Swamp\nkickout.  Each time you hit an unlit letter, you spot one of the pop bumpers.\nThe bumpers always start each ball unlit, and are spotted starting with the\ntop one and working down.  The first time through will light each bumper, and\nthe second time will cause them to flash.  Therefore, spelling GRAVE\ncompletely two times on one ball will flash all of the bumpers.  The bumpers\nthemselves are worth token points depending on their status.  Their real\nvalue lies in increasing the Graveyard.\n\nThe left ramp awards the next unlit letter in order in GRAVE.\n\nThe GRAVE value is awarded instantly upon completing GRAVE.  It is worth\n2M+1M up to 10M.  The value is held throughout the game (it never goes down).\n\nGraveyard\n\nThe Graveyard value starts at 1M at the beginning of each ball, unless it was\nheld by a Train Wreck from the last ball (see next section).  Each pop bumper\nhit increases the Graveyard value by 10K if unlit, 20K if lit, and 30K if\nflashing.  (See previous section for spotting bumpers.)  The Mansion award\n\"Graveyard at max\" will instantly make all bumpers flashing.\n\nThe Swamp will award the current Graveyard value.  The Swamp can be lit if\nthe ball goes through the lane just above the Thing flipper for 5x the\ncurrent Graveyard value (\"Quicksand, fumes, toxic waste...  It's all ours!\").\nThe maximum value the Graveyard can reach is 4M.\n\nTrain Wreck\n\nEvery time you hit the Train shot, you are awarded 1M points.  However, after\na certain number of hits, you are awarded a Train Wreck instead, worth 5M\npoints.  On normal settings, the 2nd Train hit will earn you a Train Wreck\n(\"Good show old man!\").  After that, the number of hits for a Train Wreck\nwill go up by one.  The maximum number of hits you can ever need for a Train\nWreck is 6 (I think).\n\nOn harder settings, more hits will be required for your first Train Wreck,\nand will go up from there.  A typical 5-ball setting is to have the Train\nWreck need 3 hits for the first one.\n\nTrain Wrecks are good for 2 reasons:  Every time you get a Train Wreck, you\nhold the value of the Graveyard to the next ball (instead of it resetting to\n1M).  Also, 4 Train Wrecks will light the extra ball.  (That means 14 Train\nhits:  2+3+4+5.  Or more, if your game is set harder.)  Nothing special\nhappens after the 4th Train Wreck (it will still hold the Graveyard, though).\n\nBear Kicks\n\n\nYou start the game with 1 Bear Kick.  Every time you shoot the middle ramp,\nyou get 1 more Bear Kick, or 2 more if it was lit from the right left inlane.\nAt 6-14 Bear Kicks, the extra ball is lit (self-adjustable).  An extra ball\nis also lit at 50 Bear Kicks (though this may change with difficulty\nsettings).  At 15 Bear Kicks, the currently flashing Mansion room is spotted\n(awarded).  Every 10 Bear Kicks after that will also spot a Mansion room, up\nto 95.  However, Mansion rooms will never be spotted during any Multiball,\nand if you pass 1 or more spot Mansion points during a Multiball, they'll be\nqueued up and awarded to you one at a time with each ramp shot after\nMultiball ends.  The Bear Kicks will never spot the \"?\" room.  If the \"?\" is\nlit when you pass a spot Mansion point, then it is wasted.\n\nAfter 98 Bear Kicks, every shot to the ramp scores a \"Super Bear Bonus\" of\n5M.  \"2x Bear Kicks\" doesn't do anything anymore (in fact, it may not even be\nlit).  Quite nice, really.\n\nThing Flips\n\nThis is a really cool feature.  If the ball goes through the left left\ninlane, it lights the middle ramp for Thing Flips.  (The only time this light\nwon't be on is during any Multiball and if either Thing Multiball is lit.)\nIf you shoot the middle ramp before it times out, the ball will go on down to\nthe Thing flipper (\"Let's go, Thing!\").  Here, the game will disable any\ncontrol YOU have over the flipper and attempt to make the shot to the Swamp\n(lit for 5x Graveyard now) by itself!  It does this by timing from when the\nball crosses the opto then calculating when to activate the flipper.  If it\nmakes the shot (\"Well played, Thing, you're really on the ball!\"), then you\nget 5x Graveyard.  Otherwise, the ball will hit one of the Swamp Millions\n(\"Nonono!\" or \"Slow down, Thing.\") targets, and the game will use which one\nthe ball hit first to judge whether to speed up or slow down the shot.\n\nIf the game misses the shot 4 times in a row (that is, doesn't hit the 5x\nSwamp OR any of the Swamp Millions targets), then it will throw out all of\nits previous data and start from scratch in trying to realign itself.\nGenerally, the only time this would happen is if the playfield angle\ndrastically changed from what it was before.  There is also a \"new location\"\nsetting the operator can use after moving the game which makes the game throw\nout all of its Thing Flips data immediately.\n\nCombos\n\nThere is a 4-way combo in TAFG:  Shoot the middle ramp, then the left loop,\nthen the left ramp, then the Swamp in quick succession.  Shooting either the\nfirst 3 (middle ramp->left loop->left ramp) or the last 3 (left loop->left\nramp->Swamp) will earn you a 3-way combo.  A 3-way combo is worth 5M and a\n4-way combo is worth 10M.\n\n4-way combos are very valuable indeed:  Not only do you get the 10M, but you\nalso get the 5M from the 3-way combo right before it, a THING star, Adv. X,\nand 5x Graveyard.  That can easily add up to 25M or more in the long run.\n\nExtra Balls\n\nExtra balls can be lit in a large number of ways:\n\n\n Bear Kicks (between 6-14 and again at 50)\n The Mansion room\n A Cousin It's Hideout award\n 4 Train Wrecks\n Start of Tour\n\n\nExtra balls are lit at the Thing ramp/kickout saucer.  By default, all of\nthem but the Tour extra ball will still be lit if you drain.\n\nIf more than one extra ball is lit, and there is a difference in the types\nthat are lit (i.e. may or may not go away when you lose your ball), then the\n\"temporary\" extra balls will be awarded first.  So if you have a temporary\nextra ball lit and a permanent extra ball lit, collect one, then drain,\nyou'll still have an extra ball lit next ball.\n\nWhen you start an extra ball, you may hear:  \"Keep the ball, I have a whole\nbucketful!\" or \"That's the spirit!  Shoot again!\" or \"Good show old man!\nShoot again!\"\n\nThere is available on TAFG an extra ball buyin.  Here, you may spend one of\nyour hard-earned credits on ONE extra ball with your score and everything\nelse the same.  For all intents and purposes, it is just an extra ball.\nBuying it doesn't seem to give you any advantage or light anything new.  Yes,\nyou can still get high scores after buying in.  The default is to allow one\nbuyin, but can be set to 99!\n\nAdv. X\n\nThe left loop is lit for Adv. X when the ball goes through the right inlane\n(including coming down off of the middle ramp).  Shooting it advances your\nbonus multiplier by 1, up to 5x.  The bonus multiplier only affects the\nMansion room and Bear Kick bonus.  When you have gotten 5x bonus, the \"light\nadv. x\" light goes off.\n\nEnd-of-ball Bonus\n\nAs with all other Pat Lawlor games, you are given bonus based on your\naccomplishments, not ball time or number of switches hit.  Your bonus is:\n\n(100K * Bear Kicks + 500K * Mansion rooms) * bonus multiplier + any round\nbonuses you may have gotten that ball (from Cousin It, Mamushka, or Raise the\nDead).\n\nGetting a bonus OVER 20M that includes a round bonus earns the quote \"Who\nsays you can't take it with you???\"  You won't get it if you have merely a\nmultiplied bonus without any rounds, nor will you get it for exactly 20M.\n\nStatus Report\n\nHolding one flipper button in for a few seconds will bring up the Status\nReport, assuming there isn't a ball hitting switches somewhere.  Using the\nother flipper button, you may page through (or just wait and it'll change\npages automatically) and find out lots of neat stuff about your current game.\nIt'll tell you the replay value, number of credits left, number of extra\nballs in reserve (default is no more than 4 balls at a time, BTW), status of\nGREED and THING, Graveyard value (and whether it's held or not), Train Wrecks\nand number of hits for the next one, bonus, bonus multiplier, Bear Kicks and\nwhen the next extra ball is lit, the high scores, and probably other stuff\nI've forgotten.  If you wonder about something, it's more than likely in the\nStatus Report.\n\nTilting\n\nNot surprisingly, tilting the ball means you lose it along with any bonus you\nmight have had coming that ball.  (\"Heheheh, you're a funny guy!\")  It is for\nthis reason that I don't recommend it if you have a 20M Cousin It bonus...\nThe tilt warning quote is \"Careful!\" for each warning.\n\nMansion Rooms\n\nThere are 13 rooms in the Addams' Mansion, apparently.  Each of them has an\naward or a round tied to it.  Rooms that start rounds are orange-colored.\nRooms that just award points are white.  Rooms that start Multiballs are\ngreen.  The extra ball room is red, and the \"Graveyard at max\" room is\nyellow.\n\nNormal behavior for TAFG is to have the Electric Chair lit at the start of\nevery ball, though this is difficulty-adjustable.  When the yellow light\nabove the Electric Chair is on, shoot it or the Swamp kickout to collect the\ncurrently flashing room.  (You may not be able to collect a room from the\nSwamp kickout depending on the difficulty setting.)  Doing so awards the room\n(see descriptions below), leaves it permanently lit, and advances the\nflashing room to the next one to the right, going up a row to the leftmost\nroom if the rightmost room on a row was awarded, going back to the bottom\nleft from the top right.  The \"?\" on top of the Mansion will not start\nflashing until all other rooms have been collected (lit).  It will skip over\nrooms already collected, obviously.  If the Chair is unlit, going through the\nright inlane will light it for about 5 seconds.  Shooting either the left or\nmiddle ramps will light the Chair permanently.  The Chair will always be lit\nif the \"?\" is flashing.  Shooting an unlit chair the first time after the\nlast award will earn you the quote \"It's not plugged in yet.\"  Bear Kicks can\nalso award rooms (see the Bear Kick section under Gameplay above).\n\nIf you drain when the next room to be awarded was either 3M, 6M, or\n\"Graveyard at max,\" then the flashing room will be advanced to a room that\nISN'T one of those 3.  However, if the only remaining rooms are among those\n3, then the game will not change the current room.  The pop bumpers advance\nthe room to the next one available.  A new Mansion (including the start of\nthe game) will always start with either Cousin It or Mamushka flashing (seems\nto be a 50-50 chance).\n\nThere is a small chance you may find something belonging to Cousin It...  See\nthe next section.\n\n3 Million\n\nThis award is actually \"Pugsley's and Wednesday's Trap Door.\"  It awards 3M,\nthe quote from Tish \"Look, darling,\" and another totally random room whether\nyou've already gotten it or not.  It will NOT award the \"?\".  If you haven't\ngotten the room it gives you already, it'll light it for you, and advance the\nlit room to the one after the second room.  If you've already gotten the\nsecond room, you get the award/round again, and it STILL counts towards your\nend-of-ball bonus (number-of-rooms-gotten-wise).\n\nGraveyard at Max.\n\nMakes all of the pop bumpers flashing.  \"Out to the cemetery!  Come on\neverybody!\"  (See Graveyard under Gameplay for more details on the\nramifications of this award.)\n\nCousin It\n\nThis starts a 20-second round in which all switches score a certain value\n(\"It's Cousin It!\").  You get 1M for starting the round (every time it was\nstarted, if more than once on that ball).  Cousin It is now flashing on the\nplayfield, and any time you hit the Cousin It targets, you get an amusing\npicture of a pinball hitting him in the head, 1M points added to your total,\nand the switch value increased by 50K (it starts at 200K).  I do not know of\na limit on the switch value.  If started more than once on a ball, the value\ngoes back to 200K.  You are not awarded the total until the end-of-ball\nbonus, so if you tilt, you lose it!\n\nMamushka\n\nA 20-second round where all switches score a flat 250K (\"Thuuuuuh\nMaaaaaaamushkaaa!\").  You get 1M each time you start it added to the bonus.\nIt isn't awarded until the end-of-ball bonus, same deal as Cousin It.\n\n6 Million\n\nYou get 6M points.  That's it.  Really.  Oh, Gomez says \"Six million!\"  BFD.\n\nQuick Multiball\n\nLights the Thing ramp/kickout saucer for a 2-ball Multiball (Gomez says\n\"Quickmultiball!\" really fast).  Shooting it makes Thing pick up the ball and\ndrop it into the Swamp.  If there is at least one ball still in the trough,\nthen it'll be served to the plunger.  If all 3 balls (or all the balls in the\nmachine) are in the Swamp, then you'll get a Swamp kickout warning from the\ndisplay and 2 balls will be kicked out.  If you get to plunge, then the\nsecond ball is kicked out after you hit a switch.\n\nThe goal for Quick Multiball is to shoot the vault (which is now open) for\nVault Jackpots.  The starting value is 5M.  Shooting the vault for the\nJackpot OR shooting the middle ramp increases the Jackpot by 1M up to a\nmaximum of 10M.  The Power is active during this Multiball, as with any other\nMultiball.  Quick Multiball ends when at least one ball drains.  :)\n\nThe default is to let this award stay on between balls, but on hard and 5-\nball settings, Quick Multiball turns off after you drain.\n\nFester's Tunnel Hunt\n\nThis is a 20-second round where you are supposed to search the 3 different\nholes for treasure or something (\"Look, darling, just what we've been\nsearching for.\" from Tish).  The three shots are the Electric Chair, the\nVault (which will be revealed if it isn't already), and the Swamp/Swamp\nkickout.  The first shot (doesn't matter which of the 3) earns 5M and\n\"Perhaps it's in here?\"  The second (of the remaining 2 shots) is worth 10M\nand \"There it is.\"  The last shot is worth 15M and \"Just what we've been\nsearching for.\"  If you don't make all 3 in 20 seconds, well, nothing BAD\nhappens, the round just ends.\n\n(Super) Seance\n\nSeance is a 20-second round in which you are supposed to shoot any 3 ramps\n(either the middle or left ones).  \"Knock 3 times!\"  The first shot is worth\n5M (\"That's once.\"), the second shot is 10M (\"Twice.\"), and the third is 15M\n(\"Thrice!  Well done!\").  The real kicker is that the Power is active during\nthis round.  :(  The replay knocker (it's a lot softer in TAF and TAFG than\nnormal games, BTW) is knocked one time, two times, and three times depending\non the shot.\n\nDuring Seance, the ball always goes to the Thing flipper from the middle ramp\nunless you got it right at the end of the round on the grace period or Thing\nMultiball is lit.\n\nThere is a chance (not sure, but it seems to be 25%-50%) that instead of a\nSeance, you'll get a Super Seance.  Same deal, except the shots are worth\n10M, 15M, and 20M.  This is really worth going for.  It may also pop up\nduring the Tour (same probability).\n\n9 Million\n\nThis is not unlike the 6 Million award.\n\nThing Multiball\n\nSimply labeled \"Thing\" on the playfield, this room starts a 15-second\ncountdown to get the ball to the Thing ramp/kickout saucer (\"Look,\ndarling!\").  The display changes to show you 15M points which counts down at\nthe standard rate of 1M/second down to a minimum of 3M.  When it reaches 3M,\nyou have about 3 more seconds to try and shoot for it.  If you do get it,\nThing will pick up the ball (\"And that's not all!\"), and a 2-ball Multiball\nwill start exactly like Quick Multiball.  However, the value of the Vault\nJackpots is the value at which you shot the Thing ramp and cannot be\nincreased.\n\nThing Multiball can be operator-set to start at anywhere from 10M-20M.  If\nit's set lower, you have less time (always 3-5 seconds after it hits a value\nof 3M); likewise, if it's set higher you get more time.  This is because the\ncountdown rate (1M/sec) cannot be changed.\n\nWhen Thing Multiball is lit, the middle ramp will always feed to the right\ninlane regardless of Thing Flips or Seance.  All returns to normal after you\ncollect the value or it times out.\n\nRaise the Dead\n\nThis is a dreaded pop bumper round, though since this is not a DE game, it is\nlivable.  \"Raise the dead!  Out to the cemetary, come on everybody!\"  The\nGraveyard picture (of all the graves) takes over the display with a number on\neach grave representing the number of hits of that bumper needed to raise the\ndead person from that grave.  Simple observation will show you which grave\nrepresents which bumper.  It's roughly perspectively equivalent to their\npositions on the playfield.  (Got that?)\n\nEach bumper hit adds 100K to the total (2M each time the round is started)\nfor 30 seconds.  Hitting each bumper the required number of times (which is\nusually 4, but can be set from 3 to 9) adds 3M to the total.  This is end-of-\nball bonus, BTW!  It is potentially a very lucrative round if you can get the\nball into the bumpers...  Nothing special for raising them all, except that\nyou'll have at least 19M points.  After a bumper has been \"raised\", it still\nscores 100K for the rest of the round.\n\nThe bumpers all flash at the start of the round, and the fewer hits a bumper\nneeds to be \"raised\" the faster it flashes.  It stops flashing after being\n\"raised.\"  If everyone is raised, the round ends.\n\nLight Extra Ball\n\nYOU figure it out...  \"Get the extra ball!\"\n\nTour the Mansion!\n\nTour the Mansion!  Only available after all other rooms have been collected,\nthis is the Wizard Bonus of TAFG.  It can NOT be started by spotting from\nBear Kicks.  When it is lit, the Electric Chair is automatically lit.\nCollecting it does the following:\n\n\n Turns off all the Mansion lights\n 50M (\"Fifffffty millll-yun!\")\n Marks off 3M, 6M, and 9M\n Lights the special (\"Look, darling!\")\n Marks off Quick Multiball\n Awards the \"Graveyard at max\" room (and marks it off)\n Awards the \"Light extra ball\" room (and marks it off), which must be\n        collected during that ball or it goes away.\n Goes through the rest of the rooms one-by-one starting at the bottom right\n        and stepping up the path laid out by the marked-off rooms to the upper left.\n        If you still can't figure out the order, it is:  Mamushka, Cousin It, Seance,\n        Tunnel Hunt, Raise the Dead, and Thing Multiball.  The next round is started\n        as soon as the previous one ends (Mamushka is started right away).  Any\n        rounds that were going continue just fine, except Thing Multiball gets\n        cancelled and Mamushka's timer is RESET to 20 seconds (instead of having 20\n        seconds added to the timer).\n\n\nRight before the first room is awarded, when the display goes back to the\nMansion for the room zoom-in, the Mansion picture is briefly mutilated for\nsome unknown reason.  Just a display bug.\n\nDuring the Tour, no GREED letters may be spotted.  Also, if the lock was\nalready lit, you can't lock balls.\n\nIf you go through everything, then at the end of Thing Multiball, everything\nis solidly lit and the Mansion is effectively out of play for the rest of\nthat ball.  GREED or the status of the locks are restored to what it was when\nyou started the Tour.  Since you can't get any more Mansion rooms now, just\nabout the only major thing to go for is Multiball...\n\nCousin It's Hideout\n\nThe game can be set to give a certain number of extra awards per mansion.\nThese are from Cousin It's Hideout, and it is just a random bonus with awards\nas described below:\n\n\nCousin It's Hat5M\n   (Rabbit pops out of hat)\nCousin It's Hair Brush5M\n   (It strokes his hair)\nCousin It's Sunglasses7M\n   (Cool shades!)\nCousin It's Car Keys8M\n   (It drives his car onto the screen from the left)\nCousin It's Hair Spray10M\n   (Huge spritzes of spray)\nCousin It's Hair Dryer15M\n   (Hair flys all over the place)\nCousin It's Wristwatch20M\n   (It displays his huge watch on his left arm)\nCousin It's Gold Chain25M\n   (It schwinging his chain)\nCousin It's Gold PinballLight extra ball\n   (Tosses a ball in the air a couple of times)\nCousin It's Bag of GoldLight special\n   (Picks up coins from the bag and lets them fall back in)\n\n\nThe range \"per mansion\" is from 1-4, and the default is 2.  However, after\ngoing through 1 or 2 mansions, I never got any extra items.  It may be just\nfor the first mansion.  :(\n\nThere are only a couple of rules that I'm aware of...  It doesn't appear that\nyou will get a Hideout for Pugsley's and Wednesday's Trap Door (3M room),\nthough you may from the room awarded after that.  You can get Hideouts from\nrooms spotted by Bear Kicks just as if you had shot it, and you can also get\na Hideout from the Cousin It round (same possibility as any other room).\n\nI also encountered an interesting bug:  I got Cousin It's Car Keys at the\nstart of a Tour once!  That was weird, but then for each room I went through\n(drained after starting 3 rounds), it gave me the animation again for it.\nThis has since been confirmed by other people, and it turns out that you do\nNOT keep getting the award though it keeps showing you the animation.\n\nMultiball\n\nMultiball can be a lot of fun on TAFG.  The way you light it is by spelling\nGREED.  Each time you hit the Bookcase, you get the next letter in GREED.\nFor the first Multiball, the start of each ball will spot you the next letter\nin GREED (so you basically start the game with G lit).  Also (for the first\nMultiball), tilting the ball will spot you another GREED letter for reasons\nbeyond my comprehension.  Upon completion of GREED (alternates between\n\"Greeeeeeeed\" and \"There, see what greed will get you?\"), the Bookcase swings\nopen revealing the Vault.\n\nAt times you may get really lucky, and the ball will fly into the Vault even\nthough the Bookcase is still closed.  Well, this situation was anticipated,\nand should it happen, the game will immediately spell GREED, open the Vault,\nand lock that ball!  \"Dirty pool, old man...  I like it!\"  I thought this was\nthe coolest thing I'd ever seen a game do until R&B (a DE game of all things)\ncame out with its \"Good boy, Sherman\" award.  :)\n\nAt this point, the lock(s) is(are) lit (any shot with a green flashing light\nabove it).  For the first Multiball, you may lock balls at the Thing ramp/\nkickout saucer (adjustable).  For the second lock on your first Multiball,\nyou may also lock the ball in the Swamp.  After 2 balls have been locked, you\nmay start Multiball from either of the shots with a flashing red light above\nit - the Vault (\"Not the Bermuda Triangle!\") or from the Electric Chair (\"Now\nyou've done it.\" the first time and \"It has to warm up...  So it can KILL\nyou!\" the second).  The Electric Chair will only start Multiball the first 2\ntimes (adjustable), and the Swamp kickout shot will NOT work to start.  I\nmight point out that when start Multiball is lit, the Power is active...\n\nThe start of Multiball is probably the biggest buildup of any game yet...\nAll the playfield flashers go off and get lit row by row alternating every\nother lamp while the sound gets louder and louder and the flashing gets\nfaster and faster.  Finally, Gomez yells \"SHOW-TIME!\", there are 3 more\nbooms, and Multiball starts.\n\nThe balls are kicked out one at a time - first one from the Swamp kickout,\nsecond one from the Swamp kickout or Electric Chair (depending on whether or\nnot you started Multiball from the Chair (i.e. there's a ball there)), and\nthe last one from the Swamp kickout.\n\nThe object now is to shoot either the Train for Jackpot or the left ramp for\nthe Super Jackpot.  It's an either/or situation, so chances are you'll want\nto go for the Super Jackpot.  The Super Jackpot is a double Jackpot the first\nMultiball, and a triple Jackpot for each Multiball after that.\n\nSo, just how much IS the Jackpot worth?  Good question.  But, we seem to\nfinally have an answer!  On L-1 and L-2 ROMs, it is worth either 5 or 15M.\nIf you've had 6 or more skill shots (may just be skill shot attempts), then\nit is 5M.  5 or fewer and it is 15M.  On L-3 ROMs, the jackpot is worth 10M\nfor starting it from the Electric Chair, and 15M for starting it from the\nVault.\n\nWhatever the starting value, each hit of the Bookcase or each shot of the\nmiddle ramp will increase the Jackpot by 1M, up to a maximum of 25M.\n\nCollecting the Jackpot keeps the value of the Jackpot the same.  Collecting a\nSuper Jackpot sets the value of the next Jackpot at 10M.  In either case, the\nBookcase will reopen, and you need to shoot the Vault to relight the Super\nJackpot.  (You don't get to shoot for the Jackpot after either one is\ncollected the first time, but who cares?)\n\nIf you get Dirty Pool during Multiball (the ball goes into the Vault, which\nis closed because the Jackpots are lit), then you are awarded the Super\nJackpot, the value is reset to 10M, and the Super Jackpot stays lit on the\nramp.  Cool!  Oh, and the Jackpot goes away if it was lit.\n\nHearing Gomez yell \"Triiiiple Jackpot!!\" is very cool and very satisfying.\nYou MUST hear this.  :)\n\nGomez says something near the start of Multiball during the initial flail-\naround period, but I've never understood it.  If you get a Jackpot or Super\nJackpot and still have more than one ball on the playfield, Gomez says\n\"There's more where that came from!\"\n\nIf through some vast misfortune you don't get a single Jackpot, all is not\nlost.  You get a 20-second period in which you can shoot the Thing ramp/\nkickout saucer for a 2-ball Multiball restart.  Thing will pick up the ball,\nand you will get a ball served to the plunger lane.  The Jackpot value\nremains what it was when the 2nd ball drained.  Be absolutely sure that this\nball makes it off of the plunger ramp, because the Jackpots are lit right\naway and this is an easy opportunity to make one.  If you miss the skill\nshot, but the ball still makes it to the upper right flipper, then you can\nshoot either shot before the other ball has a chance to come out.  If you\nmake the skill shot, generally there is just enough time for the other ball\nto get kicked out before being awarded a Jackpot.  If you don't make the\nMultiball restart, Gomez says \"Sorry, old man.\"\n\nWhen Multiball finally ends, the Bookcase closes back up if it was open and\neverything begins anew.  However, after the first Multiball, no more GREED\nletters will be given out for free and you must lock balls in the Vault.\n\nIf, during a multiplayer game, someone steals your locked balls from you, you\nmay simply drop a ball into the Swamp from the plunge to relock it.  A very\nnice feature indeed.  Also, at the end of the game, any locked balls are\nkicked out into the trough (adjustable).\n\nTips/Tricks/Strategies\n\nAs soon as you plunge the ball into the skill shot, you immediately have a\nchoice to make.  Do I shoot the left ramp?  The Train?  Maybe slam it into\nthe Bookcase instead...  Generally, the best thing to do is shoot the ramp.\nYou can hit the Bookcase from either of the bottom flippers if you want to go\nfor Multiball, and Train Wrecks usually happen more or less by accident as\nthe game goes on.  Generally, the ONLY time I'll shoot the Train is if the\nGraveyard value is very high (so that it'll carry over to the next ball) or\nif I'm very close to getting the extra ball from the 4th Train Wreck.\nBesides, shooting the left ramp increases the value for the rest of the ball\nand gives you a letter in THING.\n\nAs for deciding whether to go for the Mansion or Multiball, the same kind of\nlogic generally applies.  Mansion rooms are much harder to shoot than the\nBookcase, and generally the ball will wander up and hit the Bookcase a few\ntimes by inself anyway.  After a Tour, of course, you CAN'T go for the\nMansion so you might as well go for Multiball.\n\nThe 2 most important shots to master are probably the Electric Chair and the\nvault.  They can be tricky but generally aren't that difficult.  Most of the\nother shots are pretty easy (even that left ramp is much easier than it\nlooks).  Also extremely important is to learn how the balls come out of the\nChair and the Swamp kickout.  Can you catch them?  Can you let the ball\nbounce over to the other flipper for an easy shot somewhere else?  Is it\nreally fast?  Will it run into the slingshot on the way down?  Answering\nthose questions is key in keeping good ball control.\n\nWhen you light the locks for Multiball, it's generally a good idea to go\nahead and get it out of the way.\n\nDuring Multiball, always go for the Super Jackpot.  The only time it's\nmathematically to your advantage to shoot the Jackpot is when you're on your\nfirst Multiball (Super Jackpot = 2x) and the Jackpot value is >20M.  You can\nfigure out why if you want, but the difference is small enough that you might\nas well shoot for the Super Jackpot anyway.  Besides, it could wind up NOT\nbeing to your advantage, but I don't want to get into all that now...  Email\nme if you really care.  :)\n\nIf you're not sure what to do when the ball is at the upper right flipper,\nshoot the left ramp.  The only exceptions are described above and when Cousin\nIt is running.  It's worth nailing It a few times near the beginning of the\nround, but when there's only about 5 seconds left, just shoot the ramp.  The\nexception to THAT rule is if you are in Multiball.  During Multiball, any\ntimed round has the timer paused any time ANY ball is in a hole or kickout\nsaucer or something.  This can lead to insanely high Cousin It scores (like\n45M), as well as good Mamushka scores.  High Cousin Its are much more likely\nif you take the time to nail him during Multiball, though.  One more\nexception:  If the Super Jackpot is lit, shoot for that at all costs.  One\nmeasly hit on It is not going to make up the difference in the long run no\nmatter what!\n\nFor either of the frenzy rounds (Cousin It and Mamushka and especially Raise\nthe Dead), it makes sense that the best place for the ball to be is in the\npop bumpers.  This is just about the only reason to learn the right loop\nshot.  You can also plunge a ball directly into the bumpers after locking a\nball, but you should only do this when Multiball is ready to start or the only\nplace to lock the ball is the Vault, and when the round is Raise the Dead.\nOtherwise, it's usually worth going for the skill shot instead.  (For\nMamushka, you need 20 bumper hits to make up a 5M skill shot, and the chances\nof that happening are not great, though it could.)\n\nFor Quick Multiball, a good idea is to jack up the Jackpot value to 10M by\nshooting the middle ramp a few times first.  Then just plug away at the\nVault!\n\nThere's not much to say about Tunnel Hunt...  One thing I like to do is to\nflail the ball directly into the Vault from the Electric Chair kickout (not a\nhard shot once you get used to it), then flail it into the Electric Chair\nfrom the Swamp Kickout, then catch the ball from the Chair and try to shoot\nthe Swamp kickout.  If you light Thing Flips and you haven't gotten the Swamp\nyet, by all means shoot the ramp and hopefully Thing will make the Swamp for\nyou (you DO get credit for it during Tunnel Hunt).\n\nSeance is definitely tricky.  The normal Seance is often not worth the\nfrustration of dealing with the Power, though this is certainly machine-\ndependant.  You can't just hold onto the ball, though.  Generally the Seance\ntimer will stop after the Status Report starts showing on the screen.\nHowever, this often turns the Power off until you hit another target.  This\ngives you a nice clean shot at the middle ramp.  (You can turn the Power off\nin this way just about any time, so you can give yourself a clean shot at\nstarting Multiball as well.)  If you get a Super Seance, though, it is\ndefinitely worth going for, since the total for finishing it would get you\n45M.  When you shoot either ramp, it's generally OK to NOT shoot for 5x\nGraveyard and just let the ball dribble into the inlanes.  But be careful\nhere!  It's also quite possible that the ball will bounce right into the\noutlane.  If you're really lucky, you'll shoot the ramp, the ball will go\nthrough the \"light 2x Bear Kicks\" inlane, you'll shoot the ramp, the ball\nwill go through the \"light Thing Flips\" inlane, you'll shoot the ramp, and\nThing'll make the shot and you'll get 5x Graveyard, too.\n\nFor Thing Multiball, the best thing to do is to let the ball bounce over to\nthe right flipper and shoot the Thing ramp right away.  Alternatively, if you\ncan't bounce it over, flail the ball up the middle ramp (which will ALWAYS\ndeliver the ball to the right inlane while the Thing timer is counting down)\nthen shoot the Thing ramp.  Either way shoot net you over 10M easily if you\ndon't miss.  The middle ramp->Thing ramp combo generally gives you around\n12.5M and the bounce-over method generally give you 13.8M.  If when you start\nThing Multiball the value is pretty low (like below 5M), then I concentrate\non hitting things other than the Vault.  For example, this is a great time to\nshoot the left ramp and build up your Million Plus value quite a bit, which\ncan easily surpass the Thing Jackpot value.\n\nDuring Raise the Dead, if you're ever given the ball at the plunger lane and\nthere's no easy lock (skill shot or Swamp), then launch it to the bumpers.\nChances are good that you'll get a couple of graves which will give you\naround 7M points.  Raise the Dead is probably the most easily ignored round\nin the whole game because the ball often doesn't make it to the bumpers by\nitself, and no shot really puts the ball there except for the (generally\nuseless) right loop.  However, Raise the Dead, if actually shot for, can\neasily be worth more than Cousin It and Mamushka combined.\n\nIf THING is lit, but so is Multiball, make sure you collect THING first.  You\ncan't get it during Multiball, and since your main goal is to shoot the left\nramp, you'll miss out on letters for the next THING you would have otherwise\ngotten.  It's pretty easy to go through all 5 letters during one Multiball.\n\nIf something is lit at the Thing ramp and you have a ball at the plunger, be\nsure to err on the launch-too-hard side.  This is because hopefully if the\nball goes beyond the kickout saucer, it won't go TOO far and you can let the\nball drain silently and get another chance.  This is especially important if\nan extra ball is lit there.\n\nKnow what's going to happen when you're about to spot a room.  For example,\nif Thing is flashing and you shoot the 15th Bear Kick, then you should shoot\nthe Thing ramp before the room is even awarded to you and you instantly get\n15M points.  Also, during the Tour, when Raise the Dead is about to come to a\nclose, hold the ball on the right flipper and wait for it to end, then shoot\nthe Thing ramp for a very high Thing value.\n\nThere ARE cows in TAFG.  :)  The designer credits are in there as well.\n\nWhen to use the buyin?  Well, if you're really close to the Tour or you have\nan extra ball (or more) lit or if you're getting bored and want to get rid of\ncredits, then go ahead and use it.  The button is on the middle right of the\nfront of the cabinet.  Otherwise, hit start or both flippers together to\nabort it.\n\nContributors\n\nSpecial thanks to...\n\n\n Jon Biavati\n Mark Phaedrus\n Mark Valentine\n David Stewart\n\n\nThe end.

And I may end up liking it more\nthan Frankenstein.\n\nIt has a very crowded playfield (almost all shots are no more\nthan midway up the playfield), excellent backglass, playfield,\nand cabinet art, terrific dots, and decent sound (save\nfor the repetitive quotes).\n\nMost of the shots are quite narrow and somewhat difficult,\nespecially from fast-moving inlane balls.  This, combined\nwith how often the post comes up, makes gameplay pretty much\ncatch-and-shoot.\n\nThere's a lot of things to do on A13: play the missions (modes),\ngo for standard or 13-ball multiball, and completing the\nOdyssey's flight back to a Splashdown on Earth.\n\nThe theme is very well implemented into game play.\n\nThe DMD instructions and playfield light indicators are\ntop-notch as far as letting you know what you're supposed\nto do.  Your score is almost always on the display.\n\n\nDESIGN CREDITS\n\n\n Game Software - Lonnie Ropp\n Display Software - Orin Day\n Mechanical Design - Bob Hurtadu\n Music and Sounds - Brian Schmidt\n To be completed.\n\n\n\nVITAL STATS OF THE MACHINE I USED\n\n\n Serial #: 127937\n Manufacturing Date: 12/27/95\n CPU ROM: 5.01\n Barcode : 675081?\n\n\n\nPLAYFIELD - THE BOTTOM\n\n\n 2 flippers, standard.   I think they feel way better than\nthe ones on recent WMS/Bally games I've played.\n\n Slingshots, standard.   I have a tough time doing slingshot\npasses for some reason.  On the other hand, bounce passes seem\nto be particularly easy.\n\n Inlanes.  not standard, as the inlane switches are lower\nin the lane, parallel to the flippers.   This makes hitting\nthem more easy, and this is important, because hitting them\nlights the corresponding Orbit shot for a few seconds.\nMore on Orbits and Advancing the Spacecraft later.\n\n Outlanes (1M)  standard, and -no- kickback!  Foam tape covers\nthe inlane/outlane divider, and I don't have much trouble\nsaving balls from the outlanes.  Most outlane drains were\nfrom slingshot bounces.\n\n\n\nPLAYFIELD - THE SHOTS AND ONE-BALL, NON-MODE RULES\n\nThis is a little different format than most rule sheets; I'm\ngoing ahead and including the rules governing each shot in one-ball,\nnon-mode play.\n\nFrom lower left clockwise...\n\n\n D-O-C-K standup targets.   Complete them to light\nMystery at the Spinner Lane saucer.  \n\n Left orbit.   Pretty easy from a caught ball; harder from\na moving one.  Advances Spacecraft when lit (solidly at the\nstart of a game, for a brief time after hitting the opposing inlane\nrollover).  Usually the ball goes around\nand out the right orbit entrance, but it can be diverted onto\nback to the left inlane via a short ramp and wireform.\n\nAnything lit at either orbit is collected by hitting the switch in the orbit;\nthe ball does not have to go all the way around to the other orbit or reach\nthe top rollovers.  In fact, a slow ball that hits the switch a 2nd time\non the way back down will credit 2 orbit shots!\n\nAn unlit orbit is worth around 5-9M points.\n\n Food standup.   Halfway up the playfield, between the\nLeft orbit and Spinner lane entrances.  Scores a small # of points.\n\n Spinner lane.   Leads to a saucer in the bumper area\nat the top of the playfield.  The spinner scores from\n250K to 2M per spin, depending on its value, which is increased\nby the \"13\" top lanes.  Mystery is lit here, but it must be\ncollected at the top saucer.  This shot is quite easily backhandable.\n\n Rocket ramp.   A short metal ramp with a plastic rocket on\ntop.  When hit hard enough, a magnet grabs it under the rocket,\nand releases it back down the ramp toward the flippers.\nA big post pops up between the flippers when this happens,\nso your best thing to do is to let the ball hit the post and\nthen catch it in a flipper.\n\nThere's an LED (yay!) under the Rocket ramp that tells you\nhow many shots are needed to start multiball (regular or\n13-ball), and provides other info in some modes and MBs.\nWhen the LED reads 1, the next shot to the Rocket starts\nMB.\n\nThe first MB takes 3 Rocket shots to start.  Successive MBs take\n2 more (5, 7, ...)\n\n Battery standup targets: 4 of them, yellow, facing to the\nright.   At the exit of the bumper area, and a ball leaving the\nbumpers will usually hit one of them.   The manual mentions\nsomething about being able to get an extra ball from hitting them\nenough, but I've never seen any behavior from them except in the\nVoltage Mission.\n\n \"Battery Lane\": a gap to the right of the Battery standups\nthat leads to and from the bumpers. \n\n M-O-O-N standups, facing the flippers.   The leftmost\none starts out flashing, hit that to light it and flash\nthe next one.  When you complete the sequence, Shoot The Moon\n(see its section) is lit at the ramp for a hurry-up.  The sequence\nalso lights Super Jackpot in regular multiball.\n\n Blastoff ramp.   A shallow blue ramp. I haven't been able to\nbackhand it.  Has a diverter that sends the ball to either the\nleft or right inlane.  The diverter is not machine-controllable\nand just switches from side to side after each made ramp shot.\n\nA sign over the ramp has two lamps: a yellow one that indicates\nwhen a BLASTOFF letter is available, and a red one that\nis lit when the Shoot The Moon hurryup is available.  The yellow\nlamp is lit at the start of a ball.\n\nA letter in BLASTOFF can be collected via a combo when the\nyellow lamp is not lit.  The combo is either ramp -> ramp or\nramp -> left orbit -> ramp, depending on the current position\nof the diverter.\n\nHitting the Blastoff ramp is an easy way to light an Orbit\nto Advance the Spacecraft.\n\nThere's a big plastic moon in the \"kink\" of the ramp that\nhas a magnet that can grab the ball and rotate it around to a big\nhole beside of the ramp.  This happens whenever the ramp is\nhit with the yellow lamp lit in one-ball, non-mode play.\n\n Water standup.   Like the Food standup.\n\n Right orbit.   When lit, Advances the Spacecraft.  Like the left\norbit, easy from a caught ball, harder from a moving one.\n\n Mission start lane.   A short lane which leads to a saucer\n(like the ones on T2 and NF, but on the right).  A red\nlamp is above it, which indicates when Start Mission is\navailable.  This is where you collect lit Extra Balls.\nAfter hitting this shot, the post comes up for a few seconds,\nso the best thing to do is again to let the ball hit the\npost and then catch it.\n\nThis is a surprisingly difficult shot, and part of the reason\nis that hard shots to the saucer often bounce out.  This\nis most unfortunate.\n\n\n\nPLAYFIELD - TOP LANE AND BUMPER AREA\n\nPlunged balls head for the 2 top rollover lanes, labeled\n\"1\" and \"3\". Completing \"13\" advances the pop bumper\nand spinner values by 250K, to a max of 2M (they both\nstart at 250K).  After a ball goes thru\na lane it enters the pop bumper area.\n\nOccasionally a ball bypasses the top left diverter and goes down\nthe left orbit.  This gives credit for anything lit at the left\norbit.  This also sometimes happens for the right orbit.\n\n\n Pop Bumper area.  an enclosed area with three -strong-\npop bumpers.  The ball can bounce around in here for\nquite a while.  Get here from the \"13\" rollovers, or from\na shot to the Spinner lane.  Bumpers score a value of 250K\nat the start, which increases by 250K after completing \"13\".\n\nThe bumpers also increase the Shoot the Moon value, by\ntheir current value.\n\n Top saucer.  most Spinner Lane shots end up here.  The ball\ncan also bounce in here from the bumpers.  Awards Mystery\nwhen it's lit at the Spinner Lane.  Displays the Shoot The Moon\nvalue when hit.\n\nThe ball always exits the bumper area thru the \"Battery Lane\",\nunless it pops back up a \"13\" rollover and down an Orbit.\n\n\n\nSELECTING GAME MODE\n\nAfter starting a game, you have a choice of \"Regular\" or\n\"Novice\" mode.  \"Regular\" is the normal 3-ball arrangement.\n\"Novice\" is timed play; the player has 2 minutes when any\ndrained balls are autoplunged, and after the 2 minutes expires,\nthe game is over when the ball(s) on the field drains.\n\nYou can start a game in \"League\" mode by holding the left flipper\nbutton in while starting a game, and \"Wizard\" mode by holding\nthe right flipper button in.  The only special thing I've\nseen about either of these is that in \"League\" the sums of the\nscores of players 1 & 2 and 3 & 4 are also shown on the display.\n\n\n SKILL SHOT\n\nNo skill is involved.  Pick one of three awards: Start Mission,\nMystery (see the available Mystery awards below), and either Multiball\nCountdown (reduces the MB LED Countdown value by 1) or\n13 Million (if the MB LED is 1 already, or if BLASTOFF is lit).  The ball\nheads for the \"13\" rollovers, and either enters the bumper\narea or goes down either the left or right orbit lane.\n\n\nMYSTERY\n\nCollect the Mystery either with the Skill Shot or at the\ntop saucer.  Possible Mystery awards (that I've seen) are:\n\n\n         2 Orbits\n         BLASTOFF letter\n         Hold Bonus\n         Double Bonus\n         13 Million\n         50M / Washing Machine\n         Mystery 3-Ball\n         M-Ball Ready\n         (others?)\n\n\nThe first 5 are the most likely ones.  Washing Machine (har, har)\ncomes up every few games, and is worth 50M.  The manual mentions\nothers I haven't seen, like \"13 Ball Play\", \"Extra Ball\",\nand \"Light Special\".\n\nMystery 3-ball starts, well, a 3-ball multiball where the spinner\nis worth a \"mysterious\" amount of points.  Seems like it was 50M.\n\nThe 50M award was called \"Washing Machine\" in earlier (2.05, at least)\nROMs.\n\n\nSHOOT THE MOON\n\nWhen the M-O-O-N targets are completed, Shoot the Moon is lit\nat the Blastoff ramp.  It is a hurry-up shot, but counts down\n-very- slowly, so you don't really have to hurry.  You -do-\nwant to collect before losing the ball, tho :).  If you don't\ncollect it, it resets to 20M.\n\nThe Shoot the Moon value can be very large in a long game.\nI've had it over 400M in a 4B game.\n\n\nORBITS AND ADVANCING THE SPACECRAFT\n\nOooh, this is important.  Collect an Orbit and Advance the\nSpacecraft by hitting the left or right orbit when they're lit.\nThey're lit for a few seconds by the inlane switches.\nThe game starts with both orbits lit solidly.  I'm not sure\nhow the \"2 Orbits\" Mystery award affects the Orbits when they're\nlit solidly; I think I've had them both stay lit and go out.\n\nA little of my strategy: since the Spacecraft modes are so lucrative,\nI'll pick Mystery with the Skill Shot until I get the 2 Orbits\naward.  Then I'll pick Start Mission.\n\nCollecting Orbits advances your spacecraft around the moon and\nback to earth.  Your progress is displayed (very attractively)\nin the center of the playfield.  Many awards are given from\nthe Orbits:\n\n\n Orbits.  Lights Video Mode.  Start Video Mode at the right saucer.\nDuring VM, your goal is to safely land the Landing Module on the\nmoon.  The left and right flipper buttons fire the Module's thrusters\nleft and right, and hitting both buttons fires the thrusters up.\n\nTurning the plunger stops the Module's lateral movement, which\nmakes this mode trivially easy to complete.  I have no earthly\nidea why Wizard mode doesn't disable this.  Just go right and\nstop when you're above your landing spot; piece of cake.\n\nIf you do this.  The resolution of the \"distant\" animation isn't\ndetailed enough to guarantee a safe landing.  The \"closeup\" animation\nis, however, and you should find a \"key\" dot in the animation to\nmake sure you land safely.  I line up a column of dots in the background\nwith the 4 dots in the right \"foot\" of the spacecraft; if the column\ngoes thru the \"foot\" I know I'll land safely.\n\nVideo Mode is worth 50M/109M/84M for landing in the left/center/right\nareas, and 25M for crashing.\n\n Orbits.  Starts Power Down.  The clock is running, and 6 shots are\nworth 50 - 60 - 70 - 80 - 90 - 90M.  You get 10M for starting Power\nDown.  So the completion total is a nice 450M.\n\n Orbits.  Starts Power Up.  The clock is running again.  This time,\none shot at a time is lit.  Hit it to collect points and light\nthe next shot.  The scoring is the same as in Power Down.\n\n2 Orbits.  Starts Splashdown.  This is a timed multiball where\nthe Orbits score Jackpots, apparently; I haven't gotten here yet.\n\n\nOne of the reasons I love the Orbit rules is that they reward inlane\npasses, which are not at all hard to do on my machine.  I don't\nthink I've ever had one lead to a drain, either.\n\n\nMISSIONS\n\nStart a mission from the Skill Shot or by hitting the right saucer when\nlit.  The right saucer is always lit (in one-ball, non-mode play)\nuntil Master Alarm is reached; after that you have to hit the\nspinner to light the saucer.\n\nThere are 9 Missions; after doing all of them, Master Alarm is\nlit at the right saucer.\n\nYou can lock in a lit (flashing) Mission by turning the\nplunger handle.  But the Mission you locked becomes unlocked\nwhen you plunge your next ball.  So be careful.  The Missions rotate\nby pop bumper hits (maybe other shots too).\n\nWhile Missions are running, nothing else is available except\nhitting the Rocket ramp to advance towards Multiball (and this isn't\navailable during Rocket 2 Ball), and collecting a BLASTOFF letter\nif lit.  I don't know if Combos are still available.\n\nThe Missions are for the most fun to complete.  They're roughly balanced:\nmost score 100-150M except Manual Burn and Under Volt, which can be worth\n400-700M (if played correctly) !\n\nI wish there was a compelling reason to actually complete them (maybe\nthere is in Splashdown ?) other than the points you get from\nthe Mission.\n\nAll Missions have a starting value of 10M.  This is included\nin the total Mission score.\n\nThe 9 Missions:\n\n\n ORBITER.  The left orbit is lit for a value of 50M, which counts\ndown rather quickly to 10M.  Make this shot and a diverter sends the\nball up a ramp at the top of the playfield and back to the left\ninlane, where you have a shot at the right orbit to score\ntriple the value of your left orbit shot.\n\nYour first shot at the combo is the only one that's likely to be\nworth much (200M).  The value just counts down too quickly.\n\nThis is a very nice Mission to start a ball off with if you can\nshake the launched ball down the left orbit instead of into the\ntop rollovers.\n\n CO2.  The CO2 level is going up, and you have to collect\nfour items before the level reaches 20.  Collect an item\nby hitting the Spinner.  The items are: 1 Sock (10M),\n2 LCG Bags (20M), Red Suit Hoses (30M), and an Air Scubber (40M).\nIf you get all four items, you collect a bonus, which is increased\nby the bumpers during the mode.  The bonus is typically around 40M.\n\n MANUAL BURN.   The spacecraft is off course by 7 degrees.\n3 shots are lit; either the Left Orbit, Spinner,\nand Rocket Ramp, or the BLASTOFF Ramp, Right Orbit, and Right\nSaucer.  One of the 3 shots is flashing.  The solidly-lit\nshots move the spacecraft 1 or 2 degrees back on course, and\nthe flashing shot moves it 3 degrees.\n\nIf one of the 3 shots puts the spacecraft back on course, it will\nbe flashing.  Otherwise, the outermost shots will be flashing.\n\nEach shot is worth 50 + 10M to 90M until the mode ends, either by\ngetting back on course or timing out.\n\nThis mode is worth a TON of points if you DON'T get the\nspacecraft back on course.  I've gotten over 500M on\nit before, and average about 250M.\n\n ROCKET 2-BALL.  a 2-ball where the only thing to hit is\nthe Rocket Ramp.  It's worth 10 - 20 - 30 - 40M to a max\nof 50M.  It my be wisest to shoot for the bumpers\nin this mode, depending on their value.\n\nThere's a quirky series of words that go by on the display.\nSome are jokes.  I \"get\" some of them, but not all.  Anyway,\nthey're...  INCO - FAO - NETWORK - RECOVERY - LBSTR - WRMSMG\n- BOOSTER - RETRO - FIDO - GUIDANCE - SURGEON - ECOM - GNC\n- TELMU - GTBY - CONTROL - RGP.  Thought you might be interested\nin that... :)\n\n MOON'S GRAVITY.  The Blastoff ramp is lit for three shots of\n20 - 30 - 40M (?), for a total of 100M.\n\n UNDER VOLT.  Another Mission that can be worth a -ton- of\npoints.  The Battery targets are lit and the Under Volt value\nstarts at 42M and starts counting down.  Hit a Battery target\nto freeze the value and light all the major shots for that\nvalue for 20 seconds.\n\nYou can hit a Battery target a second time to reset the timer\nto 20 seconds and collect the point value.  But this can be\ntough to do as often the ball hits a target a second time quickly\nafter the first hit, effectively burning its worth.\n\n LIFE SUPPORT.  The Food and Water targets are hit for 20 - 30\n- 40 - 50M.  After hitting one of them, the bottom post comes up for a few\nseconds.  Completing the Mission earns you 150M and a shot\nof Ed Harris barfing up his dinner.\n\n DOCKING.  Hit any target in the D-O-C-K bank four times to\nget 10 - 20 - 30 - 40M and an extra ball.  I don't think you\nget the EB after the first time through the Missions.\n\n LITE EXTRA BALL.  Lights the right saucer for extra ball.\n\n MASTER ALARM.  This Wizard Mission is lit after the other 9 have been\nplayed.  It's a 40-second frenzy where every target scores 1M\nand adds 1M to a Jackpot that is lit at the Blastoff ramp.\nThe Jackpot does not reset after collecting it, and it doesn't\n(to my knowledge) have a limit.\n\nObviously, this round can be worth a ton of points if you\nhave the ramp shot down.  \n\n\nQUICK NOTE ON EXTRA BALLS\n\nThere are two possible Extra Balls that I've seen: from the Light Extra\nBall Mission and from the Docking Mission.  My machine has a limit\nof 2 Extra Balls per game.  This is probably the default setting.\nAfter getting 2 EBs, you get 50M for any \"usual\" EB instead.\n\n\nREGULAR MULTIBALL\n\nRegular (3-ball) multiball is started with a shot to the Rocket\nwhen the LED reads 1 and BLASTOFF is not lit for 13-ball.\n\nAfter hitting the Rocket, 3 balls are launched, and the bottom\npost comes up for about 7 seconds.  There is no ball saver.\n4 Jackpots are lit: at the left orbit, the spinner lane, the right orbit, and\nthe right saucer.  The value of the Jackpots seem to depend on\nthe number of balls in play and number of switch closures during multiball,\nand are typically in the 20-40M range.  Not particularly high.\n\nAfter getting all 4 Jackpots, a Super Jackpot (SJ) is lit at the\nBlastoff ramp for 150M (?) for X seconds.  After collecting the SJ,\nanother round of 3-ball multiball begins.\n\nThe SJ can also be lit by completing the M-O-O-N targets in sequence\nduring multiball.\n\n\n13-BALL\n\nWhen the 8 BLASTOFF letters (shown below the score display) are\ncompleted (they then flash), the next multiball will be 13 BALL.\n\nThere are 4 ways of collecting letters:\n\n You get one at the start of a game for free.\n  By hitting the Blastoff ramp when the yellow lamp is lit.  The\nlamp is lit at the beginning of every ball.\n  From a Mystery award.\n  From a Blastoff ramp combo.  There are two of these, depending on what position\nthe diverter is in: ramp -> ramp, or ramp -> left orbit -> ramp.  Any other switch\nbreaks the combo.  Keep in mind that the ramp can be \"faked\" after a weak\nshot that falls back down hits an inlane switch with its next shot.\n\n\nWhen 13-ball starts, the bottom post raises and stays up for about\n10 seconds.  Three or four balls are launched, and after about 5 seconds\nthe 8 balls in the 8-ball holder are released, all at once.  There is no\nball saver.\n\nDuring 13-ball, the Rocket is lit for Jackpots.  The Jackpot values seem\nto be affected by the number of balls in play and the number of switch closures.\nMy best guess is that the Jackpot = 10M * (balls in play) + 1M * (switch closures).\nIn any case, they're typically in the 100-250M range.\n\nAfter a Jackpot, the bottom post is NOT raised.  This is very important,\nas the ball will most likely head STDM.  Your options are to try to slap\nsave it, hit it with another ball (my favorite method), or just let it go.\n\nAfter 5 Jackpots have been collected, the Super 13-Ball Jackpot is lit at\nthe ramp for X seconds.  I've gotten twice, but I don't remember what it's\nworth (1B?).  If the S13BJ is collected, regular 3-ball multiball begins.\n\n\nFUN WITH BONUS\n\nEnd-of-ball bonus is worth XM * Rocket shots + XM * Blastoff Ramp\nshots number XM * Orbits number XM * Missions started.  Of course, this\nvalue is doubled if the Double Bonus Mystery award was collected.\n\n\nEASTER EGGS\n\nThe manual mentions a Hidden Video Mode and Undocumented Difficult\nCombos.  I've yet to see any evidence of either.\n\nOtherwise, there's a few goofy animations and that's it.\n\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nTo be completed.\n\nSteve Lane\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Apollo 13", "possible_shots": "D-O-C-K standup targets, Left orbit, Food standup, Spinner lane, Rocket ramp, Battery standup targets, M-O-O-N standups, Blastoff ramp, Water standup, Right orbit, Mission start lane", "manufacturer": "Sega", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/apollo13.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Apollo 13", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Introduction\n\nAttack From Mars is the latest in the line of pinball games from Williams.\nIt features a nice open playfield, and easy to understand rules. The theme\nis basically what it sounds, defending the Earth from attacking Martians.\nThe credits for the game are as follows:\n\nDesign: Brian Eddy\nSoftware: Lyman Sheats\nArtwork: Doug Watson\nMusic & Sounds: Dan Forden\nMechanical Engineer: Robert C. Friesl\nDots: Adam Rhine & Brian Morris\n\nBlatent Editorial - This is one of the best games to come out in a\nLONG time.\n\n\n2. Playfield Layout\n\nHere is the basic layout of the playfield starting just above the left outlane\nand going clockwise around.\n\nMAR Targets - 3 targets of which are the first the letters of the word\nmartian.\n\nLeft Orbit - Loops the ball up to the top rollovers and bumpers.  Lights a\n\"capture\". If capture is complete, loops ball all the way\naround.\n\nLeft Ramp - Sends ball back to left return lane.  Lights a \"Big-O-Beam\".\n\nMiddle Orbit - Locks ball when lock is lit. Otherwise sends ball back around\nto right return lane and lights lock.\n\nT Target - 1 target which is the next letter in the word martian.\n\nFlying Saucer- The main toy in the game. Knock down the forcefield in front\nof it to gain access to the three targets inside. Described\nin more detail in the Attack Phase section.\n\nI Target - 1 target which is yet another letter in martian.\n\nScoop - Used to start Martian Attack, and Rule The Universe. Also\nawards Stroke of Luck and Extra Ball when lit.\n\nUpper Lanes - Used for regular skill shot, also increase bonus x.\n\nBumpers - 3 bumpers.  Certain # of hits starts super jets.\n\nRight Ramp - Sends ball back to right return lane.  Lights a \"Tractor Beam\".\n\nRight Orbit - Sends ball up to the top rollovers.  Lights an \"Atomic Blaster\".\nIf Atomic Blaster is complete, sends ball all the way around.\n\nAN Targets - 2 targets which are the last 2 letters in Martian.\n\n3. Skill Shot\n\nThe game has a fairly easy skill shot which simply involves you shooting the\nball and then moving the flashing light to the correct rollever lane that the\nball is going through. It awards a point value and gives +5x bonus.\nThere is also a super skill shot which sends the ball around, down the left\norbit. The game then gives the player a few seconds to hit any major shot,\nwhich will score 50 million, plus complete whatever you hit. Therefore, if\nyou hit the right ramp, you will get 50 million, and it will finish the\ntractor beam. To activate the super skill shot, hold down the left flipper\nwhen shooting the ball.\n\n4. Attack Phase\n\nThe Attack Phase is the heart and soul of the game. It involves the player\nprotecting a certain country from the martians. The countries are France,\nItaly, Germany, United States, & England. To start an attack phase, all 3\ntargets which make up the force field in front of the flying saucer must be\nhit. The forcefield will then lower opening up the 3 targets behind.  Here's\nan attempt at a diagram to better explain this.\n\n\n          H              H = Hole\n        / D \\            D = Drop Target\n      /T     T\\          T = Side Targets\n    /           \\        F = Targets on force field\n      =========\n      F   F   F\n\n\nWhen the force field goes down, the attack phase starts. The object is then\nto hit any of the targets inside. When a target is hit, it puts some damage\non the attacking saucer and scores points. If more than one target is hit in\na shot, it will multiply the damage and points by the number of hits (i.e. 2\ntargets hit = 2X damage). When the saucer has taken enough damage, the drop\ntarget in the back will stay down and a shot into the hole will destroy the\nsaucer. The first saucer destroyed is worth 200 million, and goes up 100\nmillion each time. This is not a timed mode, and will not end until the\nsaucer is destroyed, not even if you lose your ball. The amount of hits\nrequired to take a shot at destroying the saucer goes up each time.\n\nOnce you defend all of the countries, you steal one of the flying saucers\nand start Attack Mars mode. First the force field must be knocked down, then\nthe object is to hit the ball into the hole (the drop target will not come\nback up). Every shot into the hole takes a chunk out of Mars and awards 50\nmillion points. The 10th shot into the hole destroys Mars and awards 2.5\nbillion points.\n\n5. Multiball\n\nThe middle orbit is used to light lock and to lock balls. If lock is not\nlit, the ball will be sent back around to the right return lane and lock will\nthen light. Hit the shot again and it will lock a ball.  Locking 3 balls\nstarts multiball. In multiball, the left orbit, left ramp, middle orbit,\nright ramp, and right orbit all light up for jackpots. Hit all of the\njackpots to light super jackpot. The super jackpot starts at the left orbit,\nand moves around every few of seconds. It moves to the different jackpot\nshots back and forth across the playfield. Once the super jackpot is\ncollected, it starts all over again. Multiball ends when less than 2 balls\nare left. If Super Jackpot is lit when multiball ends, it will give you a\n10 second countdown in which you can still collect the Super Jackpot. The\ngame allows a pretty long \"grace\" period after multiball ends as well, meaning\nthat remaining jackpots can still be collected after multiball ends. If you\ndo finish off all of the jackpots after multiball ends, you still get the 10\nsecond Super Jackpot countdown.\n\n6. Stroke of Luck\n\nStroke of luck is lit by lighting all of the lights in the outlanes and\nreturn lanes (just like lighting Khan multiball in The Shadow). It is\ncollected by shooting the scoop. It awards a random award by putting 4 on\nthe screen and having a flying saucer shooting them away until one is left.\nSome of the awards include multiball, strobe multiball, light EB, start\nattack phase, light martian attack, points, bonus X, Video Mode & Sneak Attack.\n\nFeatures started only by Stroke of Luck:\n\n Video mode is like an old Apple ][ computer game called Sabotage. You\ncontrol a cannon in the center and move it left and right (it is constantly\nshooting). Your goal is to shoot the flying saucers that are trying to land.\nYou get points for every saucer you shoot, and the mode ends when a saucer\nreaches the ground. Once per video mode, the launch button can be pressed\nand will destroy all of the saucers on the screen. This is useful for when\na saucer is about to hit the ground and it is too late to shoot it. After\n30 saucers are destroyed, an Extra Ball pod is sent down, shooting it awards\nan Extra Ball. After all of the saucers are destroyed (40 or 50 of them),\nthe mothership comes down. It moves left and right trying to avoid your\ncannon fire. Hitting it 80 times destroys it.  Finishing video mode gives\na total of around 635 million points. There is also a way to turn the flying\nsaucers into cows! To do it you have to get the cow off of the big-o-beam and\nthe tractor beam and while it is showing the animation of the cow hit the launch\nbutton (you will hear a strange noise if you do it right). If you get video mode\nafter doing this it will change video mode into a sort of \"Attack From the Pasture!\"\n Strobe Multiball is one of the coolest things in the game. When this starts,\neverything that was going on in the game stops. The force field comes up (if\nit was down) and all of the lights shut off. A strobe light by the flying\nsaucer then starts flashing, and this is the only light coming from the game.\n3 balls are then kicked out, and the object is to hit the force field as many\ntimes as as possible. The game awards 50 million per hit, and awards a bonus\nafter a certain number of hits (Light EB at 10 hits, 250 million at 20).\nThis ends when less than 2 balls are left, and the game goes back to what was\ngoing on before this started. An interesting note about this is that because\nof the Strobe Multiball, this is the first pinball game to come with an\nEpilepsy warning on it.\n Sneak Attack lights one of the martian target banks up at random. A hurry\nup value starts at 150 million and counts down. If you hit the lit target\nbank, it awards the value, gives you 2 martian bombs, and lights Martian\nAttack.\n\n\n7. Total Annihilation\n\nTotal Annihilation involves collecting the awards from the orbits and ramps.\nThe left orbit is Capture, the left ramp is the Big-O-Beam, the right ramp\nis the Tractor Beam, and the right orbit is the Atomic Blaster. It takes\n3 shots to complete one of these, unless you complete it using the super\nskill shot. Once one of them is completed, it starts a hurry-up in which\nthe flying saucer (inner targets or force field) starts at 100 million and\ncounts down. If you finish another one of the ramp/loop awards while the\nother one is counting down, the hurry up will reset at a higher point value.\nIf all 4 awards are completed during the countdown, the game will award 1\nbillion points.\n\nOnce you complete all 4 things, Total Annihilation starts. It is a 4 ball\nmultiball in which every major shot awards the Annihilation value. The lock\nshot awards an Annihilation jackpot, which is increased by hitting the other\nshots. Therefore, if you collect a lot of annihilation values, you get the\npoints for hitting it and they are also put into the jackpot making it worth\nquite a large amount. Once the jackpot is collected it resets back down to\nit's base value an can be built up again.\n\n8. Martian Attack\n\nMartian Attack is lit by hitting all of the martian targets (or can be lit\nby Stroke of Luck). It is collected by hitting the scoop.  Once started, all\n4 martians must be hit within a time limit. The martians are above each of\nthe 4 martian target banks (They start dancing around when this mode starts\nlike the Boogie Men in Elvira). To hit them, just hit a target in the target\nbank below them. If Stroke of Luck gave you a martian bomb, you can hit the\nlaunch button and it will award you one of the martians. Once you hit all\n4 martians, Martian 2-ball starts. During this you just want to hit the\nmartian targets as many times as possible. Each hit is worth 20 million, but\ncan be increased if you hit all of martian targets again while Martian Attack\nis lit. 2-ball ends when 1 ball drains.  The game records how many martians\nyou killed during this, and there is a listing on the high score table for\nthe person who killed the most.\n\n9. Rule The Universe\n\nRule The Universe is the \"wizard\" award in the game. It is a pretty hard\nthing to achieve. To get it, the following things have to have been done:\n\n At least 1 Super Jackpot must have been collected during multiball.\n Super Jets must have been started at one point during the game.\n Martian Attack multiball has to have been started.\n Total Annihilation must have been played.\n Mars has to have been conquered in the Mars Attack phase.\n 5-way combo must have been done.\n\n\nWhen Rule The Universe is started, everything becomes lit. Total Annihilation\nstarts up, the martian targets are worth 50 million, pretty much everything awards\npoints. You get a multiball with the ball saver lit for awhile.  The object is to\ncollect 5 billion points while multiball is still going. Once the 5 billion points\nhave been collected, everything stops. The game awards you an extra 5 billion\npoints as well as putting your name in the high score list as the last person to\nrule.\n\n10. Misc\n\n\n One of the best things about this game is that features don't end when\nsomething else is started up. If you have an Attack Phase going and you\nstart multiball, it keeps going. Very good idea.  Many things can be going\non at once.\n Cows are present in this game. Sometimes when you hit the Big-O-Beam, a\ncow is enlarged and the lady says \"Would you look at the size of that cow?!\"\nand it moos. The cow is sometimes tractor beamed up as well.  There is also\na picture of a cow on the right ramp.\n Once Rule the Universe has been played once, you don't have to conquer mars\nagain in order to light Rule the Universe again (but you do have to do all\nof the other things).\n Bonus can be very big in this game. I've seen bonus multipliers as large as\n42X! Awarded almost 4 billion just in bonus!\n\n\n11.

I originally wrote it for my own\nuse, but decided that maybe others would be interested in it as well.  Your\ncomments and suggestions for improvements are most certainly welcome.\nAttack From Mars was released immediately after Whodunnit, and\nearly versions of the software support the novice mode feature.  This has since\nbeen removed.  AFM continues to support player-enabled tournament mode.\nHold down a flipper for several seconds, wait for the message about tournament\nmode, and then start the game to enable tournament mode settings.  The software\nsupports the Extra Ball buy-in, even though the Buy-in button has been removed.\n(If you find a machine with an Extra Ball buy-in button, it is one of the early\nprototypes!)\n\nCredits\nDesign: Brian Eddy, who formerly created The Shadow, has most\nrecently given us Medieval Madness, and worked with Mark Ritchie\nbefore his departure on Indiana Jones.\nSoftware: Lyman Sheats, former world champion and former Sega employee.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nClick here\nfor a large picture of the playfield. (Courtesy of the\nWilliams pinball homepage)\n\n Left Outlane:  Standard.  This and the other inlanes/outlane each\nhas a yellow lamp with no text; completing all four lights Stroke of Luck.\n Left Inlane:  Standard.  Balls can roll up the inlane beyond\nthe switch and find the outlane.\n Left Slingshot:  Standard.  Scores a whopping 3,570 points.\n M-A-R Targets:  A three-bank of standups with those fat green\nplastic covers, located along the lower left side of the playfield.\nA martian figure stands above this and every other martian target\nbank; during Martian Attack, these martians bounce like the \"Boogie\nMen\" from Elvira.\n Left Loop:  Also called the Capture Loop.  This is a TA shot, and\nhas three yellow lamps to indicate your progress towards completing it.  It is also a\njackpot/Super jackpot shot, and a Combo shot.  It is a single rollover\nswitch.  The ball leads over the Bonus X lanes, where it may be stopped\nor it may continue on out the right loop if the right gate is open.\n Left Ramp:  Also called the Big-O-Beam ramp.  Has lamps for the same\nfeatures as the left loop, except the lamps are orange instead of yellow.  It has\nan entry gate at the bottom, and\na made switch at the top.  It returns the ball to the left flipper.  This\nis the easier ramp of the two.\n Lock Ramp/Hole:  Normally this is a ramp shot which feeds the\nright habitrail and returns the ball to the right flipper.  When\nLock is lit, a diverter opens and catches shots, sending them into the\nLock hole.  The Lock hole is just a popper that kicks balls out onto\nthe left ramp habitrail, returning the ball to the left flipper.  This\nshot can be lit for lock 1, lock 2, lock 3, Light Lock, a Combo, or\na Jackpot/Super Jackpot.  The ramp entrance is narrow and steep, and requires\na solid shot to make it all the way.  The ramp has a gate, and shares its made switch\nwith the right ramp.\n T Target:  Like the other martian standups, this one is between\nthe lock ramp and the saucer.  A martian figure stands above it.\n Forcefield/Saucer:  There is a motorized 3-bank of standups, like\nin \"Whodunnit\", that can raise and lower.  When lowered, it reveals\nbehind it a drop target in front of a hole, and two standups on either\nside of it.  The saucer targets are used during Attack Waves.  The\nForcefield targets are also used during Strobe Multiball.\n I Target:  On the right side of the forcefield, just to the left\nof the Stroke of Luck scoop, with another martian figure above it.\n Stroke of Luck Scoop:  A narrow scoop, at an angle similar to that\nof Final Draw in World Cup Soccer, but much farther back.  It can be\nshot from the front directly, or balls may fall in here from the\nback when exiting the jet bumpers.  The game sometimes discriminates\nbetween front and back shots; it is a back shot if a jet bumper or\nbonus X lane was last touched, and a front shot otherwise.  (This can\nbe fooled by airborne balls.)  The shot can be lit for a pseudorandom\nStroke of Luck award (yellow light), an Extra Ball (orange light),\nMartian Attack (white light), and Rule the\nUniverse (blue light).\n Jet Bumpers:  The usual three in formation similar to those on\nWorld Cup Soccer, lit by GI and not controlled lamps.  These are used during the\nSuper Jets feature.  Balls can exit below into the Stroke of Luck scoop, or\nbetween the two rightmost bumpers into the right loop.  Also, balls very\nlikely will enter back into the Bonus X Lanes a few times while balls are\na-popping.\n Bonus X Lanes:  Two rollovers directly above the jets, that can\nbe fed by either loop.  These advance the bonus multiplier, advance\nthe scoring of the jet bumpers, and award the regular Skill Shot.\n Right Ramp:  Also called the Tractor Beam.  Has lamps for the same\nfeatures as the left ramp.  It dumps the ball onto the right habitrail\nand sends the ball back to the right flipper.  This is the smallest ramp,\nand reminds me of the right ramp from Johnny Mnemonic.  It has a gate switch, and\nshares its made switch with the lock ramp.\n Right Loop:  Also called the Atomic Blaster loop.  Has lamps for\nthe same features as the left loop.  It sends the ball over the Bonus\nX lanes, and if the left gate is open, the ball should whiz out the\nother side; otherwise, the ball will land in the lanes/jet bumpers.\n A-N Targets:  Two more standups along the lower right side of the\nplayfield, with a martian figure above them.\n Right Slingshot:  Standard.\n Right Inlane:  Standard.\n Right Outlane:  Standard.\n Plunger Lane:  Autoplunger only.  Sends balls into the top of the\nright loop, towards the bonus X lanes.\n Launch Button:  Obviously, it launches the ball, but it can\nalso be lit for a Martian Bomb, and will flash when it is available.\nIt is also used during the Video Mode, but does not flash then.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe main objective of AFM is to Rule the Universe.  In order to begin\nthis feature, you must complete 6 objectives: (1) Collect at least one\nSuper Jackpot.  (2) Start Total Annihilation at least once.\n(3) Start Martian Attack\nMultiball at least once.  (4) Conquer Mars by completing all 6 Attack Waves. (5) Start\nSuper Jets, by completing a certain number of jet bumpers.\n(6) Complete at least one 5-Way Combo.\nYour progress towards completion of these six features is denoted by\nsix blue lights just above the flippers.  When the sixth feature is\ncompleted, Rule the Universe is lit at the Stroke of Luck hole.\nIf any multiball is in progress, Rule the Universe will not be lit\nuntil multiball finishes.  Shoot the SoL hole to start.  See the\nsection on Rule the Universe for details on that feature.\n\n\nSkill Shots\nThere are two skill shots available at the start of each ball, and\nimmediately after Ruling the Universe.  Pressing the launch button\nwithout pressing the left flipper button will launch the ball into\nthe Bonus X Lanes, and one of the two lanes will be flashing.  Use\nthe flippers to switch the flashing lane.  Passing the ball through\nthe flashing lane scores a normal Skill Shot, worth 10M points and\n+5X to your bonus multiplier.  Each successive Skill Shot is worth\n10M more points than the previous.\nHolding the left flipper button down while pressing the launch\nbutton qualifies you for a Super Skill Shot.  The left loop gate\nwill raise and allow the ball to whiz pass the Bonus X lanes and\nexit down the left loop.  Shooting any ramp or loop will award 50M\npoints and spot all 3 Total Annihilation lamps for that shot.\nShooting any Forcefield target will score 50M and lower the Forcefield.\nShooting the saucer hole, the Stroke of Luck hole, or the lock\nramp/hole awards nothing for the skill shot.  The value of the\nSuper Skill Shot is fixed and does not increase.  It can be scored\non a shot even if all 3 TA shots have already been completed.  The\nHurry-Up associated with completing the third TA shot is not awarded\nwhen it is completed by the Super Skill Shot.\nThere is a brief ball saver available at the beginning of each\nball.  Scoring a Super Skill Shot, or making a shot which does not\naward Super Skill Shot, turns off the ball saver immediately.  When\ngoing for the normal Skill Shot, the ball saver remains active as\nlong as the ball is in the jets/bonus X lanes and remains on a\nlittle longer after the SoL kickout.  The display will read \"Ball\nSaved / Return To Battle\" and the quote \"Return to battle, soldier\"\nwill signify that a ball is being returned into play.\nA jet lane will be flashing even if Super Skill Shot is selected.\nIf Super Skill Shot is selected but the ball does not make it all\nthe way around and lands in that flashing jet lane, a normal Skill\nShot will be awarded.  If the autoplunger is really weak and the\nball doesn't even make it over the bumper area at all, then the\nSkill Shot will remain lit for about 5 seconds and you can collect\nit during that time by shooting either of the loops to get to the\nlit lane.\nWhen any Skill Shot is awarded by traversing the flashing lane,\nthat lane is also lit towards advancement of the Bonus X\non the same shot.\n\n\nTotal Annihilation\nFour shots, the two ramps and the two loops, each have 3 lights\nin front of them.  The left loop shots are labelled \"Capture\".\nThe left ramp shots are labelled \"Big-O-Beam\".  The right ramp\nshots are labelled \"Tractor Beam\".  The right loop shots are\nlabelled \"Atomic Blaster\".\nAt the beginning of the game and immediately after Total Annihilation,\nall 12 of these lamps will be turned off, and the next lamp to\nbe awarded will flash.  Making a shot lights the flashing lamp and\nflashes the next lamp in sequence.  The first shot is worth 20M;\nthe second is worth 25M; and the third is worth 30M.  These awards\nare available during regular, non-multiball play, except that they are\navailable during Martian Multiball.\nCow Video Mode can be started by watching the animations on the\nBig-O-Beam and Tractor Beam; see \"Cows\" for more details.\n\nMaking the third lamp on any given shot starts a Hurry-Up sequence.\nThe saucer/forcefield is lit for 100M for a brief time, and then\nrapidly starts to count down, to a minimum of 25M.  Shoot the\nsaucer or forcefield (depending on whether or not the forcefield\nis up or down) to collect the Hurry-Up value.\nThe third shot to either loop will open the controlled gate to\nallow shots to that loop to exit out the other gate.  This starts\nas soon as the third shot is made, and remains in effect until\nTotal Annihilation is started, or Super Jets is started.  The choice\nof skill shot is the only other overriding effect on this behavior.\nAfter a shot has been completed three times, until Total Annihilation\nbegins, shooting that shot again scores a \"Fleeing Bonus\" of 10M.\nStarting another Hurry-Up while Hurry-Up is already in progress\nincreases the value of the Hurry-Up to 300M; starting a third\nincreases it to 500M; and starting all four simultaneously awards\n1B immediately and also starts Total Annihilation.  In general,\nwhen the last of the four TA shots is completed, the Hurry-Up is\nautomatically awarded without having to shoot the saucer or\nforcefield, and Total Annihilation Multiball begins.  The Hurry-Up\ndoes not count down any faster if more than one is lit, so when\ntwo or three are running concurrently, you have plenty of time\nto collect it.\nDuring Total Annihilation, the four shots are all lit for jackpots\nthroughout the round.  The jackpot value begins at 50M and\nincreases by 5M each time a jackpot is collected.  In addition,\nan Annihilation Jackpot is lit at the lock ramp whose value increases\neach time a jackpot is collected.  After collected, the Annihilation\nJackpot returns to its base value.  If no jackpots have been added\ninto the Annihilation Jackpot, then shooting the lock ramp awards\na regular Jackpot like the other four shots.\nEach successive start of Total Annihilation starts with a base\nvalue of 25M more than before.  For example, the second Total\nAnnihilation starts at 75M per shot.\nTotal Annihilation is a four-ball multiball.  Play continues until\ndown to one ball.  The forcefield cannot be lowered during TA.\nRegular multiball cannot be started during TA.  Combos cannot be\nscored either.  Also, the controlled gates remain closed so that\nall loop shots are kept in the bumper area during Total Annihilation.\nThe maximum Annihilation Award is 200M.\nWhen TA ends, the 12 TA lamps all reset, and you can begin progress towards\nanother Total Annihilation.\n\n\nSaucer Attack Waves\nThere are five countries under attack:  the U.S., Italy, Germany,\nFrance, and England.  You must first defend these five countries\nagainst the Martians; then in the final attack wave, you Conquer\nMars yourself.  When an Attack Wave is not in progress, pressing\neither flipper button will change the next country to be saved,\nwhich will be flashing.\nThe artifacts under attack are:\n\nU.S.: Statue of Liberty\n  (\"We gotta save the Statue of Liberty.\")\nGermany: Brandenburg Gate\n  (\"The Brandenburg Tour is in danger.\")\nEngland: London Bridge\n  (\"Blymie, London Bridge is falling down, isn't it?\")\nItaly: Tower of Pisa\n  (\"Mama Mia, the Martians are straightening the Tower of Pisa.\")\nFrance: Eiffel Tower\n\nAt the beginning of the game, or immediately after an Attack Wave\nis completed, the Forcefield will be raised.  Shoot the three\nForcefield targets to lower it and reveal the Saucer behind it.\nThe Forcefield can also be lowered by a Super Skill Shot or a\nStroke of Luck award.  On normal difficulty settings, shooting\nthe center Forcefield target when it is already lit will spot\none of the other two targets.\nWhen the saucer is revealed, shooting the drop target or the\ntwo side standup targets scores hits on the flying saucer.\n(If the drop target is broken, shooting the hole behind the\ntarget will score hits instead.)  After a certain number of\nhits, the drop target will remain down, and you can shoot the\nhole to destroy the saucer.  Destroying the saucer saves the\ncountry and light that country's lamp permanently.\nYou can score multiple hits on a single shot; the display\nwill show the number of hits and the total number of damage\npoints scored.\nFor the first Attack Wave, it takes 4 hits at 50M each to\nopen the saucer, and destroying the saucer scores 200M.\nOn each successive Attack Wave, the number of hits goes up\nby 4, the value of each hit goes up by 10M, and the bonus\nfor destroying the saucer goes up by 100M.  For the\nfifth Attack Wave, that means 90M per hit, and 20 hits to\ndestroy the saucer for 600M.\nAn Extra Ball is lit when the second\nSaucer is defeated.  Shoot the Stroke of Luck hole to collect.\nShooting either of the two standups when the saucer is\nopen scores 5M.\nIf you are in a multi-player game, and you had the saucer\nhole revealed on your last ball, and on the next ball, the\nplayer before you drains with the drop target up, it will\nremain up for you as well.  Hitting it will score 5M like the\nside targets and reveal the hole (again).\nAfter completing the first five Attack Waves, Conquer Mars\nis next.  Open the Forcefield as before.  This time,\nthe drop target will remain down, and you must shoot the\nhole 10 times to Conquer Mars.  Each shot is worth 100M\n(consistent with the scoring as before), and the final shot\nconquers Mars and scores 2.5B.\nYou can only Conquer Mars once per game.  For the rest of\nthe game, the drop target will remain up, and hits on the\ndrop target (and not the side standups) will score 100M.\nThe Forcefield will remain down for the rest of the game\nunless Strobe Multiball is started.  The blue Conquer Mars\nlamp remains lit after Rule the Universe is finished, so\nyou only need to collect the other five awards to start\nRule the Universe a second time.\n\n\nMultiball\nTo start regular multiball, you must lock three balls at\nthe lock hole.  Depending on the difficulty level of\nthe machine, it will take a certain number of lock ramp\nshots to open the lock hole.  These rules will describe\ndefault settings first.\nFor the first multiball, shoot the lock ramp once to light\nlocks one, two, and three at the hole; the next three\nshots will go to the hole, with the third starting multiball.\nAfter multiball #1, you must shoot the lock ramp once per lock.\nThe Stroke of Luck award \"Light Lock\" will do whatever would\nhave happened if you had actually shot the lock ramp.\nBalls aren't actually locked; the same ball is immediately\nreturned to the player and merely a count is made of the\nnumber of locks.  It isn't possible to steal or lose locked\nballs.\nWhen ball three is locked, multiball begins.  The ball is\npopped from the lock hole and two more balls are launched\ninto play automatically.  Five shots, the four TA shots and\nthe lock ramp, are all lit for jackpots, and each can be\ncollected only once.  The first jackpot is worth 60M; the value\nincreases by 10M per jackpot.\nAs balls are autolaunched, some legitimate shots to the right\nloop may not score jackpots.\nWhen all five shots have been made, a Super Jackpot is lit\nat the left loop.  Shooting the Super Jackpot scores 250M\npoints and relights all five jackpots again.  However, the\nSuper Jackpot moves about every 5 seconds, sweeping across\nthe five shots from left to right, then right to left, etc.\nEvery time it moves you will hear a distinctive \"blip\" sound.\nOnce collected, the five Jackpots relight, and it all starts\nover again.  The jackpot value continues to increase by 10M\nper shot (so after the first Super Jackpot, it is worth 110M)\nuntil it maxes at 200M.\nPlay continues in this fashion until down to one ball.  The\nsecond Super Jackpot per game scores 500M; the third is worth\n750M; and then it maxes out at 1B.  On some versions of the\nsoftware, it maxes at 750M and then returns to 250M for the\nnext Super Jackpot.\nIf Super Jackpot is lit when multiball ends, it will continue\nto be lit as a \"Last Chance\" for another 10 seconds and\ncontinue to move as well.  There is a short grace period at\nthe end of the 10 seconds during which the Super Jackpot can\nstill be collected.\nAlso, there is a very brief period before and after the Super\nmoves that either of the two shots will score the Super Jackpot.\nIn other words, if you shoot the next shot just before it moves,\nor you shoot the previous shot just after it moves, you will\nstill get the Super Jackpot.\nEven more, there is a short grace period at the end of multiball\nin which you can still collect one, or even two regular jackpots.\nIf you manage to collect your fifth jackpot this way, you still\nget the \"Last Chance\" 10 seconds for a chance at the Super Jackpot.\nOn default 5-ball play, you must shoot the Lock Ramp to light\neach Lock separately for each Lock, like the second multiball\non 3-ball settings.\nYou can continue to collect damage points on the Saucer during\nthis and all other multiballs, except Strobe Multiball.  After\ndestroying the saucer, however, the Forcefield will raise, and\nyou cannot begin the next Attack Wave until the multiball ends.\nOn newer software revisions, there is a trick to be tried here:\nit is possible for a second ball to get stuck behind the Forcefield as\nit is raising.  You can attempt this to park a ball out of the way\nduring the multiball.  When all other balls drain, a ball search will\noccur in about fifteen seconds and lower the Forcefield, returning\nthe ball into play.  Be careful, though, as it has a tendency to go\nstraight down the middle.\nEven better, while the ball is trapped behind the Forcefield, the\nSaucer drop target remains down (it is reset only when the next Attack Wave\nis started).  If you manage to newton the ball into the saucer hole,\nby hitting the Forcefield with a second ball, the game will automatically\nspot the next Attack Wave.  I have never done this personally, so I do not\nknow if this works during any multiball, what points it awards, and if it\nspots Conquer Mars.\n\n\nJet Bumpers\nAt the beginning of each ball, jet bumpers score 1M each.  Each\ntime the bonus multiplier is increased, the jet value increases\nby 50K for the duration of the ball.  +5X bonus increases the\nvalue by 250K.  I am not sure if the jet value is held between\nballs when the bonus multiplier is held.\nAfter 100 jet hits, Super Jets is awarded.  The jets will score\n3M each for the rest of the ball.  At the beginning of the next\nball, Super Jets will go unlit, and it take 125 hits to get\nSuper Jets again.  The third time will take 150, etc.\nSuper Jets tends to happen naturally over the course of a good\ngame, especially when there are lots of multiballs.\nOnce Super Jets is active, left and right loops are always\nheld in the Bonus X lanes, and never loop all the way around.\nThis makes it harder to collect Combos, but it does allow you\nto score lots of points off the jets.\nAfter finishing Rule the Universe, the blue Super Jets lamp\nwill remain lit (on latest ROM levels) if Super Jets is still\nactive, to allow you to start Rule the Universe again on the\nsame ball.  In that case, at the end of the ball in which Rule\nthe Universe was started, the Super Jets lamp will be turned off.\nIf Super Jets was started on a different ball, then the lamp\nis turned off as soon as Rule the Universe ends, and you can\nstart Super Jets again on that same ball.\n\n\nCombos\nConsecutive ramp/loop shots during single-ball play are counted\nas Combos.  Combos can be scored on any of the ramps, loops, or\nthe lock hole.  A 2-Way combo scores 25M, a 3-Way scores 30M,\nand so on.  There is no known maximum.  Continuous shots to the\nsame loop are especially satisfying.\nIf a loop shot stops in the Bonus X lanes, the Combo sequence\nis stopped.  The Combo sequence continues on loop shots only\nwhen all 3 TA lamps are complete (the third shot counts, too)\nand the controlled gate is open to allow the ball to exit the\nother side of the loop, and when Super Jets is not running.\nThe combo shots remain lit for a fixed time interval regardless\nof any other shots made in the interim.\nCombos are not available during any multiball unless Martian\nMultiball is the only multiball running.\n\n\nStroke of Luck\nThe scoop is lit to award \"Stroke of Luck\" at the beginning of\nthe game, and remains lit across balls.  Stroke of Luck can\nbe relit by completing the four rollover lights in the inlanes\nand outlanes.  Use the flipper buttons to move the lights left\nand right (each button moves the lights in a different direction),\nso that balls will roll in an unlit lane, which will then light\nup.  When all four are lit, they all go unlit and Stroke of Luck\nbecomes lit.  If Stroke of Luck is already lit, nothing happens;\nthe award is not stackable.\nThe number of times the rollovers are completed is counted across\nthe game (regardless of how many times you actually collect the\nStroke of Luck at the scoop).  At 10, an Extra Ball is lit at the\nscoop.  The animation and sound effect for this are easy to miss.\nOn 5-ball games, the Stroke of Luck EB is lit at 14 instead of 10.\nThe Stroke of Luck is a pseudo-random award.  Possibilities are:\n\n   25,000,000 points.  Awarded immediately.\n   50,000,000 points.  Ditto.\n   Light Extra Ball.  Shoot Stroke of Luck again to collect.\n   Light Lock.  For the first multiball, this will light all three\nlocks.  After that, it will light one additional lock, regardless if\nlock is already lit or not.\n   Award Lock.  If Lock is already lit, then that lock is awarded and\nno lock will be lit.  Otherwise the next unlit lock is awarded.\n Multiball.  Forget the locks, just start multiball.\n   Lite Martian Attack.  Shoot Stroke of Luck again to collect.\n   +5 Bonus X.  Same award as regular skill shot.\n   Hold Bonus X.  Bonus X will not reset to 1X at the end of this ball.\n Strobe Multiball.  Starts immediately.  See below for more details.\n Video Mode.  Starts immediately.  See below for more details.\n   Sneak Attack.  One of the four martians will begin jumping.  Shoot\nimmediately to score 150M; the value counts down quickly.  Hitting the\nmartian also awards 2 additional Martian Bombs and lights Martian\nAttack if it isn't already lit.\n   1 Martian Bomb.  Added to any you already have.\n\nThe award is pseudorandom, because sometimes it can be predicted.\nThe third Stroke of Luck award will normally be Strobe Multiball.\nStroke of Luck will award Video Mode the first time it is hit after\nSuper Jets has been completed, even if it is the third time.  Strobe\nMultiball will then be the next Stroke of Luck award given.\nStroke of Luck will normally award (regular) Multiball on the\nlast ball of the game if multiball has not yet been started.\nStroke of Luck will normally award 1 Martian Bomb if it is\ncollected during Martian Attack, before Martian Multiball.\nStroke of Luck is not available during any multiball.  The award\ncan only be collected from the front entrance to the scoop.\nIf tournament mode is enabled, then Stroke of Luck always awards 50M and nothing else,\nin order to de-randomize the games.\n\n\nMartian Attack\nAt the beginning of the game, the seven M-A-R-T-I-A-N targets are\nall flashing.  Completing all seven targets lights the SoL scoop\nfor Martian Attack.  The award can be collected from the front\nor back of the scoop the first time, but then must be collected\nfrom the front every other time.\nDuring Martian Attack, all four martians begin jumping up and\ndown, and you must shoot each of the four martians to start\nMartian Multiball.  You can shoot any of the M-A-R targets to\nkill the lower left martian, and likewise either of the A-N targets\nto kill the lower right one.  You have 30 seconds to kill all\nfour.\nEach killed martian is worth 20M, and killing all four starts\nMartian Multiball.  Another ball is launched into play, and the\nfour shots remain lit throughout the multiball for 20M each.\nThe number of martians killed is counted throughout game.  The\nmartians killed during the Attack phase count as well.  The game\ndisplays the name of the person who has killed the most martians\nin attract mode.\n\nEverytime the seven targets are completed during regular play,\nthe value of each Martian increases, to 30M, 40M, and finally\na max of 50M per Martian.  If the targets are completed while\nMartian Attack is already lit (but not started), then a Martian\nBomb is also awarded.\nMartian Bombs can also be awarded via Stroke of Luck and Sneak\nAttack.  These are used during the Attack phase only (i.e. not\nduring martian multiball, and they are NOT used during Video\nMode either).  The launch button will flash when you have at\nleast one martian bomb.  Pressing the launch button will then\nkill one of the remaining flashing martians for you, to help you\nto complete all four of them.  You can do this safely after\nthe ball has gone down an outlane, but not after the ball has\nlanded in the trough.  If your fourth martian is killed this way,\nthen Martian Multiball is still started, and two balls are launched\nback into play.\nMartian Bombs are stackable and carry across Martian Attacks.  Save\nbombs that you don't need or that won't help you complete all\nfour for the next Attack.  There is no known maximum to the\nnumber of Martian Bombs you can collect.  The number of total Bombs\nis displayed each time Martian Bombs are awarded, and it is also\navailable in the Status Report.  Unless used, Martian Bombs saved\nare not worth anything.\nIf one of the Martian targets is known to be bad, the game will\nspot that target for you automatically in all circumstances.  The\n\"T\" and \"I\" targets are likely to go bad at some point, since they\ntake quite a beating.\nTotal Annihilation shots can be made both during Martian Attack\nand during Martian Multiball itself.  If all 12 TA shots are\ncompleted while Martian Multiball is running, Total Annihilation\nbegins as well, so that both multiballs are running.\n\n\nStrobe Multiball\nStrobe Multiball is only available as an award from the Stroke\nof Luck.  The Forcefield will raise if it is lowered, all playfield\nlamps will be turned off, the strobe lamp will begin to flash along with\nthe three Forcefield targets, and two more balls are sent into play.\nThe objective is to hit the Forcefield as many times as possible,\nuntil back to one ball.\nEach shot scores 50M.  On the 10th hit, an Extra Ball is lit.\nCollecting the Extra Ball will temporarily illuminate the playfield\nfor the Extra Ball lamp effect.\nOn the 20th hit, a 250M bonus is awarded, but without any fanfare\nor additional lighting.  Bonus is also awarded at 30.  The display will\nalways tell you the number of total hits, and the next award to be given.\nIf Martian Attack or Martian Multiball is running during Strobe\nMultiball, then the Martian targets will be flashing.  If a Hurry-Up\nis active at the start of Strobe Multiball, then the Hurry-Up arrow\nwill flash.  These are the only other situations in which other playfield\nlights can be flashing.\nThe inlane/outlane rollovers and Bonus X lanes remain active during the round,\neven though you can't see which ones are lit.  You will be able to tell briefly\nwhich ones are lit when the playfield is lit for the Extra Ball animation.\nThere is a lengthy ball saver at the beginning of Strobe Multiball,\nand a brief ball saver after it ends.  If no balls are in play\nwhen the game recognizes the end of Strobe Multiball, another\nball is launched into play.  Basically, your ball cannot end because\nof Strobe Multiball.\n\n\nVideo Mode\nVideo Mode is only available as an award from the Stroke of Luck,\nand it is only given out once per game, per player.  The objective\nis to shoot as many saucers as possible.  Your shooter is\npositioned in the center and fires automatically.  Use the left\nand right buttons to control the direction of the shots.  Each\nsaucer hit is worth 3M.\nOnce, and only once, you may press the launch button to fire a\n\"Smart Bomb\", which will destroy all the saucers on the screen.\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with Martian bombs.\nAt 30 saucers, a percentaged Extra Ball will descend; shoot it\nto collect an Extra Ball immediately.  If the game has been\nawarding too many extra balls recently, then it may not appear at\nall.\nAt 40 or 50 saucers, the Mothership will approach.  The\nregular saucers stop landing, and the big Mothership starts descending.\nYou must shoot the Mothership before it lands.  It is a rather\nlarge ship, which zigs and zags quickly to make it more difficult\nto hit.  It takes 80 hits to destroy it; the lower right corner of the\ndisplay will tell you how many remaining hits are needed.  Completing video mode in\nits entirety is worth a total of 635M points, and displays the\nmessage \"You Have Won; The World Is Safe\".\nYou can use the Smart Bomb to kill the Mothership as well.\nThis same video mode is available in the game \"Junkyard\",\nincluding the Smart Bomb and Mothership features.\n\n\nBonus\nAt the end of the ball, bonus is awarded.  Your bonus consists\nof some random point value based on how many shots you hit during\nplay, with a base value of 5M, plus 250K for each Martian you've\ndestroyed.  This is all then multiplied by your bonus multiplier.\nIt is possible to have very big bonuses, in the billions.  The\nbonus multiplier maxes out at 250X; at that level, each Martian\nyou hit is worth 62.5M.\n\n\nRule the Universe\nAfter completing all 6 major objectives, shoot the SoL scoop to\nstart Rule the Universe.  When Rule the Universe becomes lit,\nMartian Attack and Stroke of Luck become unlit if they were\npreviously lit.  Rule the Universe is a 5-ball multiball with\nabout a 30 second ball saver in which nearly all playfield features\nare lit.  Total Annihilation runs, with the base value of each\njackpot worth 100M.  The saucer drop target scores 100M.  The\nroaming Super Jackpot is lit and scores the same as it does\nduring regular multiball, for an unlimited number of times.\nMartian Multiball is active at 50M per martian.  The Annihilation\nJackpot is lit at the lock ramp.\nIf you score 5 billion points, the playfield will go dark, the\nflippers will be disabled, and the round will end.  You just ruled\nthe universe!  An extra 5 billion points is awarded, and your\ninitials and the time of election will be displayed in attract mode\nlater on.  After a brief animation, a ball will be returned to the plunger\nlane and you can continue play.  You can also go for one of the\nSkill Shots at this point, too.  (The regular ballsaver is also active.)\nPlus, for the rest of the ball after Ruling the Universe, you\ncan collect Victory Laps by shooting any of the five combo shots.\nThe Combo arrows will be solidly lit.  Shooting any arrow unlights\nthat arrow and awards a Victory Lap (complete with whooshing sound\neffect), initially worth 100M.  Shooting the saucer drop target\nrelights all five Victory Lap shots (if any are unlit) and increases\nthe value of the shots by 10M each.  The saucer target itself\nscores 100M per hit for the rest of the game.  This is an excellent\ntime to start a multiball, especially Total Annihilation.\nThe Victory Lap value can increase up to 500M.  Maximizing Laps\nis the key to getting a really high score.\nIf you lose all balls before scoring 5 billion, then nothing else\nreally happens and normal play resumes.  This is very depressing.\nAfter RTU multiball, the Conquer Mars lamp remains lit. The Super\nJets lamp remains lit for the remainder of the current ball if\nSuper Jets is still active.  This allows you to Rule the Universe\nagain on the same ball.  With early ROMs, the Super Jets lamp was\ncleared after RTU which made this impossible, since Super Jets\ncontinued to be active on that ball, and couldn't be restarted until\nthe next ball.\nIf a player rules the universe when he/she is already ruler, then\nthe display will show \"Re-Election #1\", and so on until someone\nelse rules the universe, during Attract Mode.  (It can't know\nthis until the end of a game, when you enter your initials, unless\nyou happen to RTU twice in the same game, in which case it will\ndisplay \"Re-Election\".\nIf multiple players Rule the Universe in the same game, then only\nthe last player to Rule will get to enter initials.  In no way does any\nscoring affect whether or not you become the new Ruler.\n\nConcurrent Multiballs\nAttack From Mars supports concurrent multiballs to some extent.\nThis is a feature I can't recall any other game having ever since,\ndare I say it, Dr*c*l*.  There are four different multiballs in\nthis game:  regular multiball, Martian Multiball,\nTotal Annihilation,\nand Strobe Multiball (plus Rule the Universe, but that's a totally\ndifferent beast).  Here's how it all fits together:\nRegular multiball, Total Annihilation,\nand Strobe Multiball are\nall mutually exclusive; only one of these can run at a time.\nMartian Multiball can run concurrently with any one of them, as\nlong as the two are started in the right order.\nIn the case of regular multiball or Strobe Multiball, you must\nstart Martian Attack first, and then start the OTHER multiball.\n(Once the other multiball is started, you cannot start Martian Attack.)\nMartian Attack continues to run with the same timer, and completing\nthe martians will add Martian Multiball to your current multiball.\nThat means a ball saver will be active for a while.  No additional\nballs are added into play; you must have two for Martian MB, but\nif you have fewer than two, then you wouldn't be playing another\nmultiball, would you?  If your other multiball ends, and you didn't\nstart Martian Multiball, Martian Attack will continue to run as it\ndid before multiball.\nIn the case of Total Annihilation, you can either start TA first\nlike in the above case, or you can start Martian Multiball first\nand then start TA, as Total Annihilation shots are awarded during\nMartian Multiball.  In that case, two more balls are added into\nplay to make it a 4-ball multiball, along the normal TA ballsaver.\nConcurrent multiballs are lucrative, because with 3 or 4 balls\nin play, you are likely to hit a lot of the Martian targets\nwithout really trying.  You will always get more points, though,\nby concentrating on the major multiball instead.  (Unless you have\na high bonus multiplier, since each martian is worth something in\nbonus.)\n\n\nExtra Balls\nThere are five ways to get an Extra Ball in AFM:\n\n Complete the second Attack Wave.  On five-ball games, this defaults\nto the third Attack Wave instead.\n Complete the inlane/outlane lamps 10 times.  For 5-ball, it takes 14 completions\nof the rollovers.\n Shoot the EB in Video Mode.\n Hit the Forcefield 10 times in Strobe Multiball.\n Via a Stroke of Luck, literally.\n\nExtra balls are all lit at the Stroke of Luck hole, except\nfor the Video Mode EB which is awarded immediately.\nEach of these can only be collected once per game.\nExtra balls\nare the only awards that can be collected at the scoop even\nduring any multiball.  Normally only front shots to the scoop\nwill award the EB, but during multiball, you can collect it from\nthe front or back, since the game can't always tell which\ndirection you shot it from with absolute certainty.  So it\njust gives it to you either way.  This works with any legitimate\nmultiball but not when you have two balls in normal play\nbecause of a missing pinball suddenly appearing on the playfield.\nIn that case, you may get cheated out of an extra ball shot\nfrom the front legitimately.\nThe game seems to detect back shots into Stroke of Luck based\non jet bumper hits and rollovers.  All other shots are considered\nfront shots.  Thus, it is possible for a ball to \"air\" over\nthe hole, not touch a jet bumper, fall into the back of the hole,\nand award a front Stroke of Luck shot.\nAttack from Mars also supports the Buy-In feature at the end\nof the game.  Unlike many previous games, there is no separate\nBuy-In button; the Start button will buy an extra ball for 1\ncredit.  So don't press Start to abort the 7 sec. buy-in\ncountdown -- use the flippers or launch button (or off switch)\ninstead.  Depending on the settings of your machine, buy-in may\nbe disabled completely, or there may be a fixed or unlimited number\nof times you can buy-in.  Buy-in can also be enabled for 1/2\ncredit.  There is an extra long ballsaver at the beginning of\nevery ball bought-in, but once used, it is gone.  There is nothing\nelse special about the buy-in ball.\n\nReplays and High Scores\nThe replay value will fluctuate widely among different machines,\nbut it is most definitely going to be in the several billion\nrange, at least.  After collecting a replay, the replay value will\ngrow by 50% of its original, base value, until more coins are\ninserted (not counting buy-ins).\nThere are two high score lists, one for no buyins and one for\nbuyins.  The Grand Champion is also maintained, which is the highest score\nattained regardless of buyins.  The game also keeps track of the person\nwho destroyed the most martians, and the last person to Rule the Universe.\nI've heard that the software will support scores up to 1 trillion,\nbut I have NO way of knowing whether or not this is true.\n\nSoftware Compensation\nThere is no compensation for a broken loop or ramp switch.  This\nis most frustrating, as you won't be able to start Total Annihilation,\ncollect a Super Jackpot, and of course, Rule the Universe.\nIf you try for a Super Skill Shot but the ball falls into the lit\nBonus X lane, you will be awarded the Super Skill Shot of 50M and\nthe Saucer will open, as if you had hit the Forcefield.\nIf the drop target becomes stuck down, you will not be able to\nscore Saucer hits for a while.  (You can still score hits from the\ntwo side standups.)  After so many shots to the saucer hole, the\ngame will flag the drop target as bad, and the hole will spot\n1 drop target hit.  Once the drop target is hit again, though,\nthe compensation is turned off, so an intermittent target is\nworse than a totally hosed target.\nA bad Stroke of Luck kicker is bad news.  If only the SoL switch\nis stuck open or closed (but not intermittent), then there is some\ncompensation for balls that fall in from the back.  If a ball\ntrips one of the Bonus X lanes, and no jet bumpers or the\nright loop switch isn't triggered in about 3 seconds, the game\nassumes the ball fell into the SoL hole, and since there is\nno way to detect front shots, it awards a front SoL shot, then\nkicks out the ball.\nIf the right ramp entrance gate switch and the lock ramp gate switch\nare bad, then shooting the Lock ramp will count as both a Lock ramp\nand a right ramp shot.  (The game cannot tell the difference between the two,\nso it awards both.)\n\n\nCows\nOccasionally after shooting the Big-O-Beam or Tractor Beam, you will\nsee and/or hear a reference to a cow.  When this happens, hit the\nlaunch button repeatedly to hear lots of mooing sounds.  If you do\nthis for both of the ramps, you are qualified to play Cow Video Mode.\nYou must still start Video Mode in the regular way, by completing\nSuper Jets and then shooting Stroke of Luck.  But instead of saucers\nlanding, it will be big mooing cows!  There are no special points\nfor playing with cows instead of saucers, but because they are larger\nthan the saucers, the cows are much easier to hit.\n\nReally High Scores\nScores rollover at 100B; that score is then displayed as\n00,000,000,000.  The game remembers that you surpassed 100B,\nthough, and will put the score in the right place in the high\nscore list (assuming 100B is enough for a high score!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Attack From Mars", "manufacturer": "Bally/Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/attackfrommars2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Attack From Mars", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Most of the information contained here was compiled from\nlimited access to an early ROM (p-3 I think) but as of late last year I\nfinally get to play this fantastic game again. The version I now play is\na L-1 rom.\nNow the legal stuff. Attack from Mars and many other terms used here\nare copyrighted by Bally, Williams, and for all I know the Easter Bunny.\nThis is none of my business.\nThis sheet is posted as freeware and may be used as such as long as\nI still retain some credit for it and no-one else makes any profit from\nits use.\nThis was my first attempt at a rulesheet and at the time of writing\nthis (late 1996) I was under the impression that no-one else had done one\nyet. Boy was I wrong. Anyway, why should Cameron Silver have all the glory.\nOh well here goes nothing..\n\nPLAYFIELD LAYOUT\n\nOutlanes/Inlanes : The usual type. Each lane has a yellow light above\nit. Lighting all 4 relights Stroke of luck. completing them a set number\nof times also lights Extra Ball.\nSlingshots : The usual. No strange shapes here.\nFlippers : Only 2. the usual size.\nMartian Targets : Spread about the lower half of the playfield are 7\ntargets spelling Martian. Lighting all 7 lights Martian Attack.\nLeft Orbit : Awards Capture and jackpots. This orbit can only be completed\nas a combo when Capture is completed. A bit like World Cup Soccer.\nLeft Ramp : Feeds the ball to the left flipper, awards Big-O-Beam and\njackpots. Can also start a combo.\nCenter Ramp: Lights locks, awards jackpots and can start a combo if\nlock is not lit. This ramp is up a laneway behind the Martian saucer. Feeds\nto the right flipper unless lock is lit in which case the ball is diverted\nto the center sinkhole.\nMartian Saucer: Kinda strange this one. There is a motorised bank of\nthree targets known as the forcefield. Hitting all 3 lowers the forcefield\nand starts an Attack Wave. Behind the forcefield is a drop target with\n1 target on each side at an angle. Behind the drop target is the center\nsinkhole. Above all this is a large Martian Saucer which flashes and shakes\nduring waves.\nRight sinkhole : This can be accessed either from the bumpers above\nit or from a shot from below. The awards are: Extra Ball, Stroke of Luck,\nMartian Attack and Rule the Universe. Only Martian Attack can be collected\nfrom above with one exception. During multiball an extra ball can be collected\nfrom either direction.\nBumpers : 3 bumpers identical to World Cup.\nBonus X Lanes : Once again, the same position as World Cup. There seems\nto be no max. bonus.\nRight Ramp : Feeds to the right flipper. Awards Tractor Beam and jackpot.\ncan also start a combo.\nRight Orbit : Awards Atomic Blaster and jackpot. Like the left orbit\nthis can\u2019t be completed unless Atomic Blaster is completed.\nScattered about the playfield are 5 small saucers which flash strobe\nlights and 4 tacky green Martians which jump during Martian multiball.\nJust like the boogie monsters on Elvira.\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nThe main objective is to follow Man\u2019s basic instincts: Rule the Universe.\nThis is achieved by completing the 6 tasks displayed between the slingshots.\n5 Way Combo; Total Annihilation; Martian Attack Multiball; Super Jackpot;\nSuper Jets; Conquer Mars. These can be completed in any order. Some are\nharder than others.\n\nRULES\n\nSkill Shot : There are 2 skill shots. The basic skill shot launches\nthe ball to above the bumpers. You have to collect the flashing lane like\non Corvette or Flintstones. This is worth 10M + 10M for each successful\nshot. This also increases the bonus X by 5X.\nSuper Skill Shot : Holding in the left flipper when launching the ball\nenables super skill shot. The ball continues around the orbit and the object\nis to hit a ramp, orbit or the gate for 50M. This also completes the feature\non a ramp or orbit and starts an attack wave if you hit the forcefield.\nAttack Waves : Opening the forcefield starts one of 5 Attack Waves.\nThe object is to protect one of 5 countries from alien attack by hitting\nthe drop target repeatedly. The countries are: France; Germany; Italy;\nEngland; USA. The display shows a saucer damaging one of that countries\nNational Treasures, e.g. stealing the Statue of Liberty. The display also\nshows a damage meter which decreases each time you hit the drop target.\nHitting the targets beside the drop target multiplies the damage caused\nand the points awarded. The drop target is worth 50M per hit 1st wave,\n60M 2nd wave and so on. When the damage meter is empty the drop target\nstays down and a shot to the center sinkhole destroys the saucer. This\nis worth 200M 1st wave, 300M 2nd wave and so on. Completing the 2nd wave\nlights Extra Ball. Each wave has an assortment of quotes in that countries\naccent.\nAttack Mars : The 6th wave is an attack on Mars. First you lower the\nforcefield as normal. This time the drop target stays down and you have\nto hit the sinkhole 10 times. Each shot takes a chunk out of Mars on the\ndisplay. On the 10th hit Mars explodes and you are awarded 2.5B. After\nconquering Mars, each shot to the center drop target scores 100M for the\nrest of the game.\nMultiball : Shooting the center ramp lights locks. Lock 3 for multiball.\nAll ramps and orbits are lit for jackpot starting at 60M and increasing\nby 10M for each hit. After hitting all 5 jackpots a traveling super jackpot\nis lit worth 250M. After super jackpot, all jackpots are re-lit. After\neach super jackpot the value increases by 250M to a maximum of 1B. This\nvalue is held for the entire game.\nMartian Multiball : Lighting all 7 Martian targets lights Martian Attack\nat the right sinkhole. You have 30 seconds to hit each bank of Martian\ntargets to start Martian multiball. This is a 2 ball Multiball in which\nthe object is to hit as many Martians as possible. Each Martian is worth\n250K which is added on during the bonus count. Martian Attack Champion\nis displayed in attract mode.\n5-Way Combo: Shooting any ramp starts the combo lights flashing. shoot\nany arrow to continue the combo sequence. combos are worth 10M+10M for\neach successive shot.\nTotal Annihilation : Shooting any ramp or orbit spots one of the features\nbelow it. The first shot is worth 20M, the 2nd is worth 25M and the 3rd\nshot lights hurry-up at the gate for 100M. completing all ramps and orbits\nstarts Total annihilation 4 ball multiball. All jackpots are lit starting\nat 50M and increasing by 5M for each shot. The center ramp is the Annihilation\nJackpot and is worth 100M + 15M for each other jackpot made like Cryoprison\non Demo Man.\nSuper Jets : Each bumper hit counts down from 100. Reaching 0 starts\nsuper jets for 3M per hit. A subsequent super jets will require an extra\n25 bumper hits.\nStroke of Luck : A random award collected at the right sinkhole. The\nawards are: Start Attack Wave, Light Extra Ball, Video Mode, Light/Award\nLock, Strobe Multiball, Multiball, Hold Bonus, 25M or 50M. Stroke of Luck\nis re-lit by lighting all 4 inlanes and outlanes.\nStrobe Multiball : A 3 ball multiball. All playfield lights are off\nexcept the strobe lights and the forcefield. The aim is to hit the forcefield\nas many times as possible. 10 hits lights extra ball and 20 hits awards\n250M.(??)\nVideo Mode : You control a cannon and have to shoot at descending saucers.\nThe flippers control the direction of your shots. If a saucer reaches the\nground the mode ends. If you shoot enough saucers, you have to take on\nan alien mothership. 80 hits will destroy the mothership. Pressing the\nlaunch button activates a smart bomb which destroys every saucer in the\ndisplay. Only 1 smart bomb can be used.\n\nRule the Universe\n\nA 4 ball multiball with everything major lit. Total Annihilation and\nMartian Multiball are running and the super jackpot is lit . The object\nis to score 5 Billion points during multiball. If you get the 5B the game\ngoes dark and kills the flippers. You are then awarded an additional 5B\nand the title \"Ruler of the Universe\". The current ruler's initials are\ndisplayed in attract mode. For the rest of that ball, all 5 arrow shots\nare lit for a victory lap. This starts at 100M and increases by 10M each\ntime. Shooting the saucer relights the arrow shots. Failing to achieve\n5B is fairly depressing. The game just continues on as if nothing has happened,\nleaving you to wallow in your sorrow.\n\nTIPS AND TACTICS\n\nThe Importance of Multiball\nOn later attack wave it takes quite a few hits to destroy the saucer.\nStarting multiball after you start an attack wave gives you 3 balls to\nattack the saucer with instead of 1. Starting Martian attack can also work\nin the same way. Always remember to start the attack wave before multiball\notherwise you will not be able to start the wave.\nAnother variation of this is to start Total annihilation while Martian\nattack is going which gives you 4 balls instead of 2 to build up huge Martian\ntotals.\nA useful trick while in multiball is to try and get a ball trapped behind\nthe forcefield. Then when another ball hits the front of the forcefield\nthe trapped ball will (usually) bounce straight up into the hole behind\nthe drop target. This awards you the points for the next city and displays\nthe words \"Dirty Pool\" on the DMD.\n\nSkill Shot vs. Super Skill Shot\n\nAvoid the temptation to use Super Skill Shot. 50M looks tempting but\n5X bonus + 10M increasing with each ball can add up to a lot more. Also\nthere is a good chance that the ball will go back up the lane off the bumpers.\nWhat goes up must come down and the lane change is very useful here. Also\nsuper skill shot lights all 3 features if you hit a ramp but you miss out\non hurry-up which means 100M down the toilet. It\u2019s just not worth the effort.\n\nCOWS\n\nThere are 3 cows to my knowledge. 1 is a cow drawing on the right ramp,\ncows sometimes appear when you spot big-o-beam or tractor beam. Pressing\nthe launch button when any of these cows appear gives a sound effect. Doing\nit for both cows enables Cow Video Mode. The next video mode will feature\ncows instead of saucers.\n\nRANDOM NOTES\n\nAttack from Mars is IMHO the one of the top games of all time. It\u2019s\nnot a hard game to get into but reaching Rule the Universe is a challenge\neven for the best players. I'm no wizard by any means and due to an enforced\nlayoff (couldn't find a machine) it took nearly 18 months before I finally\nmade it to Rule the Universe.\nThe sound is nothing special, but the quotes fit the theme of the game\nvery well, even if some of them are very corny. The graphics are good especially\nattacking Mars and the start of multiball.\nOn the gameplay side, most shots can be made without too much difficulty\nbut the right sinkhole can be a bitch. My main gripes are the very greedy\noutlanes and the fact that the drop target can send the ball straight down\nthe middle. I really miss the kickback too.\nAll in all Attack from Mars should offer enough challenge for players\nof all skill levels (no this is not an ad). The scoring is fairly high\nso expect scores in the high billions. The replay boost is around 1.5B\nwhich isn\u2019t really as bad as it sounds. One thing I don\u2019t miss is the extra\nball buy in, which is turned off by default.\n\nBragging\nHighest score so far:\u00a0 64B including 2 Rule the Universes (both\nwon!!!). Unfortunately I drained with the 3rd RTU lit. :(\n\nTHANKS TO\nChris Bonney chrisb@enternet.com.au\n\nSUGGESTIONS AND COMMENTS\nAny suggestions, comments and insults can be e-mailed to me via Chris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Attack From Mars", "possible_shots": "Outlanes/Inlanes, Slingshots, Flippers, Martian Targets, Left Orbit, Left Ramp, Center Ramp, Martian Saucer, Right sinkhole, Bumpers, Bonus X Lanes, Right Ramp, Right Orbit", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/attackfrommars3.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Attack From Mars", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Balls are fed in from the left ramp. When enabled, the canon\nswings out to aim up the playfield. There is a \"Fire\" button on the lock\ndown bar to fire the canon at the designated shot.\n\nFlippersTwo standard flippers, right about where you'd expect to find\nthem.\n\nLeft InlaneA normal inlane. The left ramp dumps the ball here if it is\nnot fed to the Laser Canon. Has the \"H\" of \"S-H-A-G\".\n\nLeft OutlaneA normal outlane. Has the \"S\" of \"S-H-A-G\".\n\nMOJO StandupsTwo standup targets.\n\nMini MeA spinner with a plastic \"Mini Me\" figurine on it in place of the\nusual paddle. It is counterweighted and spins well when hit. This is at the\nentrance to the Left Loop, which leads all the way around to the Right\nLoop.\n\nFat Bastard RampA short ramp leading to a toilet seat with Fat Bastard.\nThe ball exits the toilet to the \"Mini Me\" lane to its left.\n\nBig Frickin' LaserThe left ramp. Loops around behind Fat Bastard, down\npast Mini Me, and exits to the Laser Canon or the Left Inlane.\n\nLeft StandupA small standup target at the left side of the entrance to\nthe Time Machine ramp. Goes \"beep\" when you hit it.\n\nTime MachineRight in the centre of the playfield, there is a short ramp\nthat leads up to a spinning disk with a pinball sized hole in the middle.\nShots to this toy are stopped, then released out the back in to the Loop\nand returns via the Mini Me spinner.\n\nRight StandupA small standup target at the right side of the entrance to\nthe Time Machine ramp. Goes \"beep\" when you hit it.\n\nDr. EvilA motor driven (up/down) target shaped like the good doctor. When\nup, hit him with the ball to score ???. Comes up briefly at the beginning\nof ball, to show you that he's there.\n\nRollover Lanes / SkillshotTwo rollover lanes. At the beginning of a ball,\none will be lit to collect the skillshot (Bonux 6X).\n\nPop BumpersThree.\nWhat's to say? They're pop bumpers.\nAustin Powers HoleA scoop beneath a large Austin figure. Drop the\nball in the scoop and watch Austin spin. Has playfield lights leading up to\nit for ???.\n\nRight Ramp??? Loops around the back, then down the right side and exits\nto the Right Inlane.\n\nRight Loop???\n\nRight OutlaneA normal outlane. Has the \"G\" of \"S-H-A-G\".\n\nRight InlaneA normal inlane. The Right Ramp dumps the ball here. Has the\n\"A\" of \"S-H-A-G\".\n\nBall PlungerA combo-plunger. The player uses the manual plunger. The game\ncan auto-launch balls to start multiball, ball savers, etc.\n\n\n\nRules:\nAs with many recent games, Austin Powers is a mode based game. Complete the\nmajor shots a number of times to start a mode related to that shot.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of the Austin Powers pinball machine is\nthat each of the six main modes has a definite successful completion.  During\nnormal play, you may look at the lights for a mode to identify one of three\nstates:\n-1-\n Mode has never been started.  The red light for the mode will be dark\n    while the lights below will indicate one of the following patterns [bottom\n    to top]\n\n    Flash Off  Off  Off   4 hits will start mode   \n     ON  Flash Off  Off   3 hits will start mode   \n     ON   ON  Flash Off   2 hits will start mode   \n     ON   ON    ON Flash  next hit will start mode \n\n-2-\n Mode has been started but not completed (i.e. 'failed').  The red light\n    at the top will be lit, but the lights below will be as per\n    -1-.\n-3-\n Mode has been completed.  All five lights are lit solidly.  Making the\n    shot will award a \"GROOVY\" sound and graphic and award 1M, but have no\n    other useful effect.\nCompletion criteria for each mode:\n\nMini MeComplete the Mini Me spinner four times to start Mini Me Hurryup.\nHit the Mini Me spinner again to lock in the value, then more times to\ncollect that score. During this mode, the number of flashing lights below \nthe \"Mini-Me\" lane will show the number of shots remaining.\n\nFat BastardComplete the Fat Bastard ramp shot four times to start Fat\nBastard Multiball. This is a four-ball multiball with jackpots.\n    Hit all six shots four times each during multi-ball.  The number of\n    flashing lights below each target shows the number of shots remaining.\n    The fourth hit on any shot is worth Super Jackpot, but additional hits\n    (until all six have been hit four times each) score nothing.\nLots and lots of farting, too. There is a generous ball saver on the\nmultiball start.\n\nFrickin' LaserComplete the Laser ramp shot four times to enable the Big\nFrickin' Laser. Up the ramp again to load the ball launcher. It swings out\nto aim at the playfield, and you hit the \"Fire\" button to shoot the\nlaser \n    into the Austin Powers hole.  If you miss, you may try\n    again immediately (without shooting Laser ramp four more times) by shooting\n    the ramp within a short time limit.  If you miss a second time, you can\n    get one more chance by shooting the ramp quickly.  A third miss ends the\n    mode immediately.\n\nTime MachineA cool and simple ball catcher. Shoot the ramp up to the\nhole in the spinning disk. Four times and you start Time Machine multiball.\nThis is a two-ball multiball with jackpot shots.\n    Hit all six shots once during multi-ball.  If the lights below a shot\n    are lit, it will award jackpot.  Otherwise the shot will be worthless.\n    Making all six shots will relight all six.\n\nSub-drill\n    Shoot both ramps four times each within time limit.  The number of\n    flashing lights below each ramp shows the number of shots remaining.\n\nHenchmen\n    Shoot all six shots once each during time limit.  The top red light near\n    each shot will be lit until the shot is made.\n\nS-H-A-GSpell \"S-H-A-G\" by collecting the letters from the in/outlanes. Starts\nSHAG Hurryup.\n\nBonus MultiplierCollect the top two rollover lanes to advance the end of\nball bonus multiplier.\n\n\nExcept for the multi-ball modes (Fat Bastard and Time Machine), making all\nthe required shots will cause a mode to exit immediately.  In the multi-ball\nmodes, you may keep going after making all the shots as long as you keep\nmore than one ball in play.  If you've made all the shots, however, the mode\nwill become unavailable as soon as you lose multi-ball.  Note, btw, that if\nTime Machine is no longer available, shots to the Time Machine become\ndangerous since the ball-saver associated with them will no longer be in\neffect.\nStarting the fourth mode will light extra ball.  Starting the sixth mode\nwill enable Virtucon multi-ball.  I've not figured out the exact rules of\nthis mode, but it's a multi-ball mode with a very generous (over a minute?)\nball-save timer.  Each of six shots will score a 'jackpot' the first time\nyou hit it, and hitting all six will reset the targets so they may be shot\nagain.  As a big incentive for completing modes, however, any mode that\nyou've completed may be shot any number of times for a double jackpot.  So\nif you've completed all six shots during the Time Machine multi-ball you can\nsimply start bashing away at the Time Machine during Virtucon multi-ball for\nlots of points.\nEach shot in Virtucon multiball will start with the red light lit; the shots\nfor completed modes will also have the remaining lights flashing.  Making a\nshot will turn off the red light but if the other lights were flashing they\nwill remain so (you need to make all six shots to re-enable shots for non-\ncompleted modes, so having the red light turn off lets you know you've made\nthe shot even though, as indicated by the other flashing lights, you may\nstill shoot it again for Super Jackpot.\nBased on the backglass display, I believe that completing all six modes will\nenable Moon-base multiball.  I have not managed to do that,\nhowever.\nThe game features a not-terribly-useful \"MOJO\" multi-ball.  After spelling\nMOJO in the left-side targets (or having the multi-ball enabled via Mystery),\nthe game starts a two-ball multi-ball in which the goal is to bash Dr. Evil\nten times.  Once this is done, Dr. Evil drops down and the six main shots\nbecome available.  Hitting Time Machine awards Super Jackpot and caused Dr.\nEvil to pop up until you hit him ten more times, etc.  Dr. Evil is worth\n1M, then 1.1M, etc. so bashing him enough times can start to get a little bit\nlucrative, though not a whole lot (30 bashes yield 45 million).\nA few notes on scoring: watching the display won't tell you where many of the\npoints in the game come from.  The skill shot is worth 6M plus, and each extra\nbonus X earned in the top lanes is 1M.  More significantly, starting\nany mode for the first time yields about 10M, and completing any mode yields\nabout 15M.  A successful laser shot, for example, shows up on the backglass\nas being worth 3M, but is in fact worth closer to 30M.\nThe machine does seem to have some annoying quirks sometimes.  It is very\nodd in when it registers Mini-Me and Time-Machine (or, all too often, doesn't).\nThe left ramp sometimes fails to award an \"H\" letter since the\nball sometimes skips over the switch.  Hitting Time Machine during MOJO\nmulti-ball shortly after the machine registers loss of a ball will sometimes\naward Super Jackpot and cause Dr. Evil to pop up again and stay up during\nnormal play (poses a bit of an obstacle).\nMode interactions are rather interesting.  During multi-ball, no other modes\nare ever allowed, but otherwise many modes may overlap.\n\nMini-MeDoes not prevent starting any other mode.  Runs as normal during\n  most modes, but timer is suspended during multi-ball.\n\nFat-BastardNo other modes possible\n\nLaserOther modes locked out during try-again timer.  This timer also locks\n  out the SHAG lights.  You can still score letters, but you can't see the\n  lights to know how to shift the lanes (BOO!).\n\nTime MachineNo other modes possible\n\nSub-DrillLocks out Laser, but other modes possible.  Runs as normal during\n  most modes, but timer is suspended during multi-ball.\n\nHenchmenLocks out other modes except perhaps MOJO multi-ball.\n\n\nStarting Mini-Me or Sub-Drill just before Fat Bastard can be very lucrative,\nsince you have lots of time and four balls with which to repeatedly bash the\nshots that need repeated hits.\nBall Savers\n\nThe game includes two ball-savers in addition to the\nvery long ball-savers on multi-ball.  If the ball drains immediately after\nSCORING the time-machine (it must be an eligible target) during single-ball\nplay, the machine will try once to relaunch it (if the relaunch attempt\nfails, you lose).  Also, if you start the SHAG Hurryup with an outlane\nduring single-ball play you'll get the ball back.  Note that for that to\nwork the system must recognize that you are in single-ball play.  Being in\ntwo-ball play and having both balls go down opposite outlanes simultaneously\nstarting the hurry-up does not qualify.\nSince the \"Shoot again\" light stops blinking well before the end of the\nmulti-ball ball-saver, I have found the best way to judge the expiration of\nthe ball-save is to listen to the music.  The music has an ABAC pattern, and\nthe multi-save ends around the start of the C [for Time Machine, it's the\nominous slow notes; don't know how best to describe other modes].\nAs for the other two ball-savers, if the ball drains immediately\nafter SCORING the time-machine during single-ball play, the machine will try\nonce to relaunch it (if the relaunch attempt fails, you lose).  Also, if you\nstart the SHAG Hurryup with an outlane during single-ball play you'll get the\nball back.  Note that for that to work the system must recognize that you are\nin single-ball play.  Being in two-ball play and having both balls go down\nopposite outlanes simultaneously starting the hurry-up does not qualify.\n\nArtwork:\nVery bright and colourful artwork. As expected, it's 1960s cartoony with\nflowers, psychedelic swirls and Brittish flags. If you're in to the theme,\nyou'll probably find lots of cool things to look at.\n\nFor some reason, there is a small plastic cat screwed to the inside of the\ncabinet, near the upper right hand corner of the playfield. It's too small\nto be easily seen by the player and serves no obvious purpose. The next\nversion of the hidden cow maybe?\n\nSounds:\nLots of theme-specific comments, voice quotes, and such. A few random\n\"beep\" noises for the standup targets by the entrance to the Time Machine\nramp. As with the artwork, if you are in to this theme, you'll find lots to\nlike here.\n\nComments:\nI give the Stern guys high marks for theme integration on this one. Despite\nthe fact that I don't care for the theme itself, it's well used and the\nvarious voice quotes and sounds fit well in to the game. The toys are\nappropriate and the Time Machine ball catcher thing is both simple and\ncool. The artwork is loud, but appropriate and (IMHO) attractive.\n\nThis game might be set up a tad too easy, as I only paid for my first\ncredit, played three games, and had to leave with a credit still on it.\n\nA few people have commented on the playfield layout so far. Maybe it's me,\nbut it seems a lot like AFM or MM to me. The shots are pretty much the\nsame, and in the same order, as AFM. This isn't a bad thing, as AFM was a\npopular game, but there's no new ground being broken in playfield design.\n\nCopyright:\nThis rulesheet is copyright 2001 by David Gersic.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Back to the Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Back to the Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the Future\n\nRules Sheet, version 1.2 (January 9, 1993) By Michael Dunn\n\n\nBackground\n\n\"Back to the Future\" marked the start of the Data East trend of getting\nthe rights to well-known names and slapping them on their pins.  There are\nvarious references to the movies all over the game, including pictures of\nChristopher Lloyd (as Doc. Emmett Brown) but not Michael J. Fox.  The pictures\nof Marty McFly don't show the person's face, and the hair definitely is not\nFox's.  The voice used in place of Fox's is rather pitiful, as well.\n\nThere are two major point-scoring objectives:  the unlimited million round\nand multiball.  These two rounds are independent of each other, and you can\nhave both going at the same time.  There aren't very many side awards to\ncollect along the way, so getting the two rounds is your best bet for high\nscores.\n\nThe LCD display is a 2-line, 16-character-per-line version (identical to\nthe display found on Williams's Taxi and later pins) so the highest score you\ncan record is 100 million.\n\nPreliminaries\n\nI'm writing this rule sheet entirely from memory, so forgive my occasional\ninaccuracies.  If you have corrections/suggestions/spare $20 bills, please mail\nthem to me at any of the addresses at the top of this rule sheet (preferably\nthe Internet address).\n\nAny info that I'm not sure about will be marked with a question mark, just\nso you know that it's a guess.\n\n\"Back to the Future\" is a trademark of Universal Pictures, and \"Multiball\"\nis a trademark of Williams/Bally.  Yes, you read that right.  Williams just\nhadn't sicced their lawyers on Data East yet, so the name \"Multiball\" appears\nin this game even though it shouldn't.\n\nI will use the abbreviation \"K\" for a thousand points and \"M\" for a\nmillion points.\n\nGeneral Layout\n\nStarting at the lower-left corner and going clockwise, here's what you'll find\non \"Back to the Future.\"\n\n\n Left in/outlane   The outlane can be lit for a special, and the inlane lights\nthe ramps to advance the ramp award sequence.  A white light at the top of\nthe inlane flashes to let you know that the ramps will spot the next award.\nNo kickback (cheer!).\n\n \"Hey McFly!\"\nMcFLY standup targets   These targets are very low and at the far left of the\nboard.  You must hit M first, then c, then F, etc., but there is no penalty\nfor hitting a target out of order, nor do the targets time out.  Completing\nthe targets the first time during a ball increases the spinner value.  After\nthat, they just award a bonus.  **WARNING**  When you complete the targets,\nmost of the general illumination turns off and the McFLY lights flash,\nmaking the ball *very* difficult to see for about 2 seconds.  McFLY does not\ncarry over between balls, and the spinner value resets after each ball.\n\n Left Ramp   This is a narrow ramp that feeds the right inlane.  All the ramp\nparts are made of clear plastic.  This shot can collect various awards,\nincluding the Skill Shot, multiball Jackpot, loops, DELOREAN letters, and\nmillion.  Above the entrance are three lights labeled \"Skill shot, Jackpot,\nUnlimited Millions.\"  The appropriate light(s) will flash to indicate what\nawards are available.  There are also lights on the board below the entrance\nthat indicate the Skill Shot award.\n\n Lock Saucer   This is placed between the left ramp and the bumpers.  It has\nwalls on both sides, so a ball has almost no chance of falling in here by\naccident.  Shoot here to lock balls, and collect an extra ball when lit.\nBalls are kicked up and on to a habitrail that feeds the left inlane.\n\n Lock mechanism   This is just a metal piece situated under the habitrail that\nrotates up to catch balls, and down to release them.\n\n DMC drop targets   Three drop targets, placed below the bumpers.  Each target\nhas a red light in front of it to indicate if it is available (flashing)\ncollected (steady) or not available (off).  The targets are used to light\nlocks and jackpots.\n\n Bumpers   There are 3 bumpers, behind the drop targets.  They do nothing\nspecial, just award points.  The ball will enter the bumpers after a shot\nthru the spinner.\n\n Spinner   Each spin adds to the Biff's Casino bonus, which is awarded at the\nend of the game.  If McFLY has not yet been completed during the ball, each\nspin awards 1090(?) points, and if it has been completed, each spin awards\n5K(?).  There is a large circular yellow light on the board in front of the\nspinner that indicates the spinner's value:  steady for the lower value,\nflashing for the higher value.\n\n Clock Tower saucer   This is located between the spinner and the right ramp.\nIt is *very* shallow and will not always hold a quickly shot-in ball.  It\nalso can kick a ball straight down the middle, so I suggest jiggling the\nmachine as the ball is being kicked out.\nDuring one-ball play, shooting this saucer will award the flashing Clock\nTower award.  The awards are (I'm not sure about a couple of them, and\nthere's one more that I've forgotten):\n50K, 100K, 50K + hold bonus, light Extra Ball (self explanatory)\nTurbo Bumpers (increases the value of the bumpers)\nBonus at 5x (just what it says)\nMillions (immediately spots all DELOREAN letters and starts the million\nround; if the million round is already going, time will be added to\nthe timer)\nAfter you collect all 8 awards, all 8 lights will flash.  Hitting the saucer\none more time awards 500K and resets the awards.  The flashing award is\nchanged by the spinner.  The awards you collect are carried over between\nballs.\n\n Right Ramp   This ramp is also clear plastic, feeds the right inlane, and has\n3 status lights just like the left ramp.  This ramp's entrance is very wide,\nbut has a rather small sweet spot because the right side of the upslope runs\nstraight back (to accommodate the plunger shot).  A ball that falls down the\nramp will hit a one-way gate at the exit of the plunger lane and bounce\nwildly away.  In other words, if you miss the shot to the right, the ball\nwill go *clunk* against the right side of the entrance, rattle around, and\nfall back down.\n\n DOC standup targets   These targets are placed low and on the right, and face\ndirectly leftward.  They awards Bonus multipliers (up to a max of 6x)\nand light the outlane Specials.\nEach target has a light in front of it to indicate its value.  Here's how\nthey work:\nAt the start of each ball, one target will be flashing.  Hitting that target\nONLY will advance the Bonus X and start another target flashing.  Hitting\neither of the other targets will spot it; you must now hit the other 2 to\nadvance the Bonus X.  The single flashing light will time-out after a while,\nand another target will begin flashing.\nHowever, once the Bonus X reaches 5x, you must hit all 3 targets to advance\nthe multiplier to 6x.  The first time you do this, the outlanes lite for\nspecial.  Completing the targets after the multiplier is at 6x awards a\nbonus of 100K(?).  I don't remember if the multiplier is held by the\nBonus Hold award from the Clock Tower.\nOne outlane is lit at a time, and Special remains lit throughout the\ngame until it's collected.  The Special CAN be lane-changed with the flipper\nbuttons.  (sure wish TZ had that!)\n\n Right in/outlanes   Similar to the left side, with the same lights.\n\n Plunger   A manual plunger.  Plunging at full strength will send the ball up\nthe right ramp.  This is what you should do in order to collect the skill\nshot.\n\n Ramp Sequence lights   Yellow lights just in front of the flippers that\nindicate the ramp sequence awards you have collected.\n\n Flippers & Slingshots   2 of each, in the usual places.\n\n\nThe Skill Shot\n\nThe skill shot is available every time you plunge a ball.  To collect it,\nplunge the ball around the right ramp, then immediately shoot the left ramp.\nPossible awards are:\n\n\n   100K x ball in play\n    Extra Ball\n    Double Score:  Your score is immediately doubled\n    Take High Score:  Your score immediately becomes the current game's highest\nscore.  This never appears in a one-player game.\n\n\nOnly the \"100K x ball in play\" award will be given on balls plunged after a\nlock.  Any award may be given on the first plunge of a ball.\nYou have to be doing pretty poorly to get the EB award.\n\nDELOREAN Million Round\n\nExcept for the Skill Shot shots, each ramp shot spots a letter in\nDELOREAN.  The letters you have spotted are shown on a panel above and behind\nthe bumpers.  Lighting all the letters starts a 12-second timer.  Each ramp\nshot then scores 1M until the timer runs out.\n\nThe timer never stops running, so try to keep the ball away from the\nbumpers and saucers during this round.\n\nThis round progresses independently of Multiball, and you can start it\nduring Multiball.\n\nLater Million rounds start with less time, down to a minimum of 6 seconds.\n\nOther Ramp Awards\n\nThe ramps also have a sequence award.  When the ball rolls thru either\ninlane, a white light above the inlane will flash for a few seconds, indicating\nthat either ramp will award the next lit sequence award.  There are 6 awards\n(25K, 50K, 75K, 100K, 125K, Lite Extra Ball) each having its own light.  The\nflashing light indicates the next point value that will be awarded, except\nin the case of the first, which flashes only after an inlane is hit.  The\naward value will time out and decrease one level after a while if not\ncollected.\n\nThe sequence resets after each ball, and once you light the extra ball\nfrom the sequence, later inlane-to-ramp shots on the same ball award 125K.\n\nThe ramps still award DELOREAN letters along with the sequence awards.  I\ndon't remember if the sequence is awarded during Multiball.\n\nHitting either ramp, then immediately hitting the left ramp adds one to\nthe loop counter.  Beating the current loop champ's number of loops awards 500K\nas soon as you beat the record.  Loops are awarded in addition to anything\nelse that may be lit at the left ramp, in either one-ball or Multiball play.\n\nWhen you beat the loop record, you enter your initials at the end of\nthe game.\n\nMultiball\n\n\"A severe thunderstorm is headed for Hill Valley.\"\n\nFirst, a note about the locks.  For the first Multiball, you must hit all\n3 DMC drop targets to light a lock, and you can stack up to 3 locks.  The\nsecond time, you cannot stack locks.  On subsequent multiballs, you must hit\nthe DMC targets in order, and hitting a target out of order resets all the\ntargets, and you must start over with the D target.  The game will usually\nallow you to hit D and M when D is lit, and M and C when M is lit, and give you\ncredit for both targets -- usually.\n\nYou have to lock 3 balls to start Multiball.  If someone else you're\nplaying with starts his/her own multiball and leaves fewer balls in the\nlock than you had during your turn, the game will automatically light\nenough locks at the Lock Saucer to get you back to the number of locked\nballs that you had.\n\nConversely, you can NOT steal other players' locked balls.  If there are\nthree balls in the lock mechanism when you lock a ball for lock number 1 or\n2, play will resume with a ball being released out of the lock mechanism.\n\nNow, on to Multiball.\n\n\"Roads?  Where we're going we don't need...roads.\"\n\nWhen Multiball starts, one ball at a time is released down the habitrail\nand into the left inlane.  You must hit the DMC targets to light the jackpots.\nOnce you do so, shoot the ramps to collect the jackpot awards.  The first shot\nto a ramp scores 500K, the second 750K, and the third 1M.  Each ramp has its\nown jackpot, and the two are independent of one another.  The awards you have\ncollected are indicated by lights on the bottom of the backglass.  Collecting\nall 6 jackpots scores an additional 1M.  To relight the jackpots, you must\nshoot DMC in order.(big ?)\n\nIf you do not collect all 6 jackpots, those that you do collect are held\nover to the next Multiball round, and you will not have to hit DMC to light\nthem.\n\nMiscellaneous Stuff\n\nWhen you light an extra ball, shoot the Lock Saucer to collect it.  Extra\nballs can be stacked, but they will all disappear if you lose the ball without\ncollecting them.\n\nDuring Multiball, shoot the Lock Saucer 4 times to light an extra ball.\nYou don't have to collect the extra ball during Multiball, though.\n\nClosing Credits\n\nWhew!  I hope this rule sheet helps you out, if only a little bit :>\nThanx to Josh Lehan for filling in the gaps\nin my memory (namely, the bonus-x, and better info on the skill shot).\n\n\"Your future is whatever you make it...so make it a good one!\"\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Back to the Future", "possible_shots": "Left in/outlane, McFLY standup targets, Left Ramp, Lock Saucer, Lock mechanism, DMC drop targets, Bumpers, Spinner, Clock Tower saucer, Right Ramp, DOC standup targets, Right in/outlanes, Plunger, Ramp Sequence lights, Flippers & Slingshots", "manufacturer": "Data East", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/backtothefuture.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Back to the Future", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

It is a very friendly-themed\npin, based on the life of a cat and the things they tend to do\n(accompanied by the sounds that they tend to make :-)).  The game\ncredits are as follows:\n\n\n  Playfield: Barry Oursler\n  Software: Ed Suchocki\n  Mechanix: Don Sondej\n  with support by Al Cardenas\n  Art Clafford and Mark Johnson\n  Sounds & Music: Dan Forden\n  Good Management Support by Walter Smolucha & Joe Joos\n  Cats & Dogs, Bees & Birds by the Pinball Python\n\n\nI suppose you could call Bad Cats a cousin of Cyclone.  Both are\nfun-themed pins with just a single ball and I highly suspect that\nthe \"SEAFOOD\" wheel is the same mechanism as the Mystery Wheel in\nCyclone.\n\nBad Cats also comes with a very amusing backbox toy of a woman\nwith a broom smacking a spinning cat.  She also has a butterfly\ntattoo on her butt.  :-)\n\n\nPLAYFIELD LAYOUT\n\nWe'll take this in the usual clockwise fashion, starting from the left\nflipper:\n\n\n Left Flipper   Standard 3\" yellow flipper, nothing unusual here.\n Left Slingshot  Standard size slingshots for this era.\n Left Inlane  Opens Bulldog's Mouth (lights DogHouse scoop) when lit.\n Left Outlane  Awards \"Curiosity Spin\" spin when lit.\n \"Bird\" Drop Target Bank  Five drop targets.  Hit them all down to\naward a B-A-D C-A-T-S letter, working toward\nlighting the Jackpot shot.\n Tiger Ramp  Long ramp on the left, going up to the top of the playfield\nand down the right side, emptying into the right inlane.\n Left Rubber-Switch  Just to the right of the Tiger Ramp is a simple\nleaf switch behind a rubber band.  When hit, it\nmakes a dog bark, and awards 50 (BIG) points.\n Trash Can Eject Saucer  Just left of the Fish Target, shoot the lane\nthat curves around, awards the Trash Can\nvalue (10K) when \"Empty\", or the \"Fish Bone-Us\"\nwhen lit.  The value may be multiplied 10X,\nif lit.  The ball is then ejected towards the\nbumpers.\n Fish Target  This is a \"linear\" target, with the picture of a cat on\nit.  Theoretically, the harder you hit the target, the\nmore it will award you.  This target lights the awards\nfor \"Fish Bone-Us\".\n Center Lane  Nothing special, it curves around and leads to the top\nrollover lanes.\n Right RubberSwitch - On the right wall of the Center Lane, this switch\nmakes a cat meow sound, and awards an even bigger\n10 points per hit.\n \"SEAFOOD\" wheel  This is a gimmick in the middle of the playfield.\nA cat is fishing and there are eight fish in the\npond.  The wheel spins and whichever one ends up\nin the net will award it's appropriate value.\n Fishbowl Ramp  Center ramp, easily hit from either flipper.  This\nramp awards increasing values, up to an Extra Ball,\nand is also where you collect the Jackpot.\n Top Rollover lanes  Three rollover lanes that spell T-O-Y and empty\ninto the bumpers.\n Jet Bumpers  There are three, in the usual configuration.\n Barbecue Lamp  Flashlamp, in the middle of the three jet bumpers.\n \"Milk Bottles\" Drop Target Bank  Three drop targets.  Hit them all down\nto award a B-A-D C-A-T-S letter, working\ntoward lighting the Jackpot shot.\n Doghouse Scoop  This is a scoop, roughly playfield-mirrored to the T2\nDatabase shot.  \"Ralphie\" the Bulldog lives here.\n Right Outlane  Awards \"Curiosity Spin\" spin when lit.\n Right InlaneLights the 10X lamp at the Trash Can, when inlane is lit.\n Right Slingshot  Looks damn similar to the left slingshot, only in\nreverse.\n Right Flipper  Ya know, this one looks awful familiar too...\n\n\n\nSKILL SHOT\n\nThe ball is shot into the upper rollovers.  One is selected at random,\nand will be flashing.  Pass the ball through the flashing lane and the\ngame will award you BONUS 2X + 120K + lighting the barbecue light.\nLane-change does not move the Skill Shot lamp.\n\n\nBARBECUE\n\nOkay, well, I've yet to see a Cat hold a barbecue, but then, perhaps\nI just didn't get invited.  The barbeque, when lit, causes the point\nvalue of the jet bumpers to go up from 500 points each to 5,000 points\neach, plus accompanying cat meows and the occasional dog bark for each\nhit.  It's worth lighting it just for the sound effects ... really!!!\nIf you don't light it via the Skill Shot, you can light it by completing\na drop-target bank.\n\n\nINLANES\n\nThe left inlane, when lit, lights the DogHouse scoop.  The right inlane,\nwhen lit, lights the 10X Fish Bone-Us.  One lane is always lit, when\ncollected, the light moves to the other lane.  The lit lane can also\nbe moved by the slingshots, possibly the left/right rubber-switches,\nand maybe even the jet bumpers.\n\nFISHBOWL RAMP\n\nThe center ramp wraps around a Fish Bowl (well, sticker) and, when lit,\nawards 30K, 50K, 100K and Extra Ball.  On Factory Default settings, the\nramp is lit at the beginning of each ball until the EB is collected.\nYou may only collect one EB from this ramp per ball (though once I saw\nit happen twice, so this is probably a reflexing option).  If it isn't\nalready lit, you can light it by completing a drop-target bank.\n\nS-E-A-F-O-O-D\n\nYeah!  The S-E-A-F-O-O-D feature is collected from a lit Doghouse.  The\nDoghouse is lit by passing through a lit left inlane, or by shooting\nthe unlit Doghouse.  It is lit for 20 seconds on Factory Settings.\nShooting a lit Doghouse spins the S-E-A-F-O-O-D wheel, which will award\none of the following prizes:\n\n\n Spots B-A-D C-A-T-S letter & 25,000 points\n 10,000 points\n Special\n 50,000 points\n Lites Jackpot\n Spin Again & 100,000 points\n Extra Ball\n 250,000 points\n\n\nThe wheel is also spun if you manage to collect \"Curiosity Spin\".\n\n\nTRASH CAN / FISH BONE-US\n\nThe Trash Can is linked to the linear \"Fish\" target.  If you don't\nhit the Fish target, the Trash Can is considered \"Empty\", and will\naward 10K if you hit it.  Hitting the Fish target will light the\nfish for 25K, 50K, 75K, 100K or 500K.  These are timed and will\nslowly unlight, one at a time, until only the 25K lamp is hit, so\nafter hitting the Fish target, you'll want to shoot for the Trash\nCan.  You get 20 seconds per lamp, on Factory Settings.\n\nNow if you manage to pick up a lit right inlane, this lights the\n10X multiplier.  Should you do this, the awards from the Trash Can\nare multiplied by, you guessed it, 10X.  That means 100K, 250K,\n500K, 750K, 1M or a huge 5M points (plus a delightful sound and\nlight show).\n\nDue to a bug in the software, the light on the Trash Can doesn't\nreally mean anything.  The trash can is routinely unlit at the\nstart of each ball, but the Fish Target and 10X lamps, if lit, are\nleft lit.  All awards from the Trash Can are controlled by the Fish\ntarget and the 10X lamp so these really carry over from ball-to-ball,\nregardless of the actual Trash Can light.\n\n\nTIGER RAMP\n\nThis is the far left ramp, not a particularly easy shot, and a weak\nshot can easily go SDTM ... so be sure you make this shot, or get good\nat nudging and slap saves.\n\nOn Factory Settings, this ramp is always lit for something.  First it\nis 50K, then 100K, then 200K, then 1 million points, unlimited.  There\nis also a 20 million point lamp, but the scorecard doesn't tell you\nhow to light it.  I will.\n\nOn your last ball ONLY, will the 20 million point lamp light.  And this\nis only after making consecutive ramp shots to go from 50K --> 1 million.\nYou can only collect this 20M value once.\n\nOddly enough, this ramp isn't timed.  You could theoretically hold the\nball forever and the ramp will retain it's value.  You must, however,\nmake consecutive ramp shots in order to advance the ramp value.  Should\nyou fail to do this, everything unlights except for the 50K lamp (or\nwhatever your starting value is, based on difficulty settings).  Be\ncareful not to nail a birdie drop-target by accident.\n\nNow for particularly high scores, you can sometimes pick up the 20M shot,\ndrain down an outlane, pick up an Extra Ball from the \"Curiosity Spin\",\nand then pick up *another* 20M.  Theoretically, you should really only\nbe able to pick up 20M once per game.  I've seen this happen twice, but\nwasn't able to get it to occur later on.  So I guess you could call this\nan intermittent software bug.\n\nJACKPOT\n\nThis is a progressive Jackpot, which is carried over from game to game,\nuntil it is collected.  The Jackpot starts at 1 million points, and\ngrows.  The lights on the backglass will give you an idea of how much\nthe jackpot is worth ... up to 8 million.  The Jackpot value, itself,\ncan go up to about 20 million.  The game seems to max the Jackpot at\n20M, plus whatever extra digits happened to be around when it broke\nthe barrier.  Therefore, it's quite possible to get a maximum jackpot\nof say, 20,010,000 ... which is what was on the machine last I looked.\nbut I've seen higher.  The Jackpot appears to grow by 10% of each\nplayer's score.\n\nThe Jackpot is lit by hitting the drop targets.  Each successive sweep\nof a target bank awards a B-A-D C-A-T-S letter, and brings you one step\ncloser to the lit jackpot.  Completing B-A-D C-A-T-S lights the jackpot\non the center ramp.  It takes one hit to collect it.  There is no limit\nto the number of Jackpots you can collect per game.  You must relight\nthe Jackpot via the Drop Targets every time so it's a lot of work, plus\nthe Jackpot returns to 1M after being awarded and works its way up from\nthere, so this may not be very lucrative.\n\nCURIOSITY SPIN\n\nCuriosity killed the cat and this is sort of the reverse.  The \"Curiosity\nSpin\" lamps are lit at both outlanes (simultaneously) on your last ball.\nIf you happen to, umm, die, by the outlane, you get a Curiosity Spin,\nwhich spins the S-E-A-F-O-O-D wheel.  The beauty of this feature is if\nyou happen to be under the average game time, the game will award you an\nExtra Ball as a consolation to your game (assuming the consolation ball\nis turned on).  You might also pick up an EB by luck of the draw, er,\nspin.  If you do pick up an Extra Ball, you do NOT get Curiosity Spin\nlit again for this new, last ball.\n\nBONUS\n\nBonus on this game is like the old days.  You get various bonus points\nfor hitting various things around the game.  None of it carries over\nfrom ball to ball and nothing is awarded for things like B-A-D C-A-T-S\nletters that you have picked off.  From around the game, you get:\n\n\n  1,000 bonus points to start, per ball\n  1,000 bonus points per hit of the linear \"Fish Bone-Us\" target\n  1,000 bonus points for any ramp entrance switch\n  2,000 bonus points for lit Doghouse\n  2,000 bonus points for knocking down any Drop Target\n  2,000 bonus points for any top rollover lane (lit or unlit)\n  2,000 bonus points for any inlane switch (lit or unlit)\n  5,000 bonus points for the Tiger Ramp scoring switch\n 10,000 bonus points for completing the Bird (5-bank) Drop Targets\n 10,000 bonus points for the Trash Can (lit or unlit)\n 15,000 bonus points for the Fishbowl Ramp scoring switch\n 20,000 bonus points for completing the Milk Bottles (3-bank) Drop Targets\n 30,000 bonus points for any Outlane switch (lit or unlit)\n\n\nCompleting the top rollovers will give you a bonus multiplier, from 2X\nto a maximum of 7X.  The bonus itself maxxes out at 999,000 bonus\npoints.\n\nMULTI-BALL\n\nMulti-Ball is pretty simple.  Install more than one ball into the game\nand voila!  Multi-Ball.  Chances are, though, that the game will get\nawful confused when you do this, so it isn't recommended.  Besides that,\nyou rarely see cats playing with more than one ball at a time.  At least,\nI don't.\n\nNow, on the off-chance that you suffer from triskaidekaphobia (fear\nof the number 13), then you probably appreciate hotels and elevators\nthat have no thirteenth floor.  In this case, you may safely ignore\nthis entire section and not change the rules one bit.\n\nSOFTWARE BUGS\n\nBad Cats has a couple of software bugs.  Perhaps the biggest is that\nthere is NO \"Status Report\", despite what it says on the apron.  I\ninstalled the Bad Cats LA-5 (latest) ROMs into Earthshaker and they\ndid not produce a Status Report.  Alternatively, I installed Elvira\nROMs into Bad Cats and they DID produce a Status Report.  That's\npretty conclusive evidence that it isn't a hardware fault so I'm\njust going to go ahead and call it a software bug.  I do not presently\nhave any other Bad Cats ROM revisions to test, so maybe it was there\nonce, and broke in a later software revision.  If you have hard, cold\nfacts to the contrary, please Email me.\n\nAnother software bug is that the Trash Can is supposed to be unlit\nat the start of each ball.  It is, but the 10X lamp and the Fish\nBone-Us lamps do NOT get reset, so even though the Trash Can itself\nis unlit, if you hit it, you get all the bonus awards you would\nhave gotten if it had been lit.  All things considered, I suppose\nwe shouldn't complain.\n\nLast, there's that bug about sometimes being able to pick off the 20M\nshot from the Tiger Ramp twice in a game.  Honestly, this shouldn't\nbe possible.\n\nOne iffy one, which is likely true for all System 11-ish games, is that\nwhen the scoreboard turns over (at 100M points), the game will award\nyou another Replay for passing the Replay score again (and again).\n\nThere are also no cows in the game (at least, not that I could find).\nYou can call that a bug if your really want to.\n\nThat's it folks.\nPlease Email any corrections or suggestions to me\nat:\n\nBill Ung\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Bad Cats", "possible_shots": "Left Flipper, Left Slingshot, Left Inlane, Left Outlane, Bird Drop Target Bank, Tiger Ramp, Left Rubber-Switch, Trash Can Eject Saucer, Fish Target, Center Lane, Right RubberSwitch, SEAFOOD wheel, Fishbowl Ramp, Top Rollover lanes, Jet Bumpers, Barbecue Lamp, Milk Bottles Drop Target Bank, Doghouse Scoop, Right Outlane, Right Inlane, Right Slingshot, Right Flipper", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronics Inc.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/badcats.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Bad Cats", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

The people of the earth cried out, \"Who will save us from the\ntorment of pinball hell?\"  Then, one day, a new beginning took shape; along\ncame the savior and his name was Pat Lawlor.  And Pat said \"Let there be Banzai\nRun,\" and there was Banzai Run.\n\n\"Banzai Run\" and \"Williams\" are probably trademarked names, but I'm\nusing them anyway.  This rule sheet is shareware, but if you would like the\ncomplete set of rulesheets, please send $29.95 to bowen@cardinal.stanford.edu.\nOf course, any comments or corrections are appreciated, and I'd really like to\nhear from someone who owns this game, or has played it in the last four years.\nMost of these rules are from personal memory from when I was about 12 or 13, so\nexpect everything to be pretty much wrong.\n\nStill to be answered: what lights the Special?  Help me out :)\n\nGeneral Information\n\nBanzai Run's major attracting feature is its upper playfield, referred\nto as \"Banzai Hill\".  Unlike most other two-level games, Banzai Run's upper\nplayfield really goes up, straight up; it's on the backglass.  Because of this,\nthe backglass is about a foot or two higher than the average game, with the\nscoreboard on top.  Play on the backglass is unusual, due to the extreme slope,\nand usually doesn't last too long.\n\n(Lower) Playfield Description and Basic Rules\n\nGenerally from the lower left, around to the back, then back to the\nlower right.\n\n\n Left Inlane/Outlane  The left outlane is equipped with a kickback which usually\nsends the ball into the bumpers.  The inlane lights \"Double Lap\" on the\nramp, and also lights the right spinner for 3K/spin.\n Slingshot Kicker  BR's left slingshot has an unusual design; the top and left\nof the slingshot contain a kicker, similar to TZ's Rocket.  This kicker\nfires the ball straight upward, usually toward the Captive Ball.\nSometimes the kicker fires the ball right to the entrance to the Hill.\n Left \"1-Lap\" target  This target, near the exit to the ramp, adds one lap to\nyour total when lit.\n \"Race Blue Beard\"  Three standup targets on the left side of the playfield.\nShoot all three to light Blue Beard on the Hill.\n \"Race Red Hot\"  Three targets just above the Blue Beard targets.  Shoot all\nthree to light Red Hot on the Hill.\n Captive Ball  Just above the Red Hot targets.  The ball can be shot for either\n1OK, 25K, or 5OK, depending on your total laps.  It can be lit for an\nExtra Ball as well.\n Left Spinner  This spinner scores 1K per spin, 3K if lit by the right inlane.\n Hill Entrance  Through the Left Spinner, this shot will activate a magnet to\nthe upper playfield if the Hill is lit, else it will kickout toward the\nGreen Machine rollovers.\n \"Race Green Machine\"  Three rollover targets at the very top of the playfield.\nThe left two lead to the bumpers, and are separated from the rightmost\nrollover by a barrier.  The rightmost rollover leads to the upper right\nflipper.  Complete all three rollovers to light Green Machine on the Hill.\nYou can advance the lit rollovers with the flipper buttons.\n Bumpers  Typical three, 1K per bump.\n Bumper Saucer  This saucer is located within the bumpers, but can also be shot\nstraight-on between the Yellow Belly targets.  It spots a target on one of\nthe four opponents, lights the kickback, plays \"Freestyle\" if lit, is the\nTime Lock hole during multiball, and also functions as the multiball\nrestart.  It's pretty important.\n \"Race Yellow Belly\"  Three standup targets located in the middle of the\nplayfield.  The left two are separated from the rightmost one by a hole\nleading to the Bumper Saucer.  Shoot all three to light Yellow Belly on\nthe Hill.\n Right Spinner  Spinner scores 1K per spin, 3K if lit by the left inlane.\nShooting through the spinner hard enough leads through a one-way gate to\nthe Green Machine rollovers, and a very hard shot goes all the way to the\nHill Entrance hole.\n Upper Right Flipper  Standard length flipper, usually used to peg standup\ntargets and the Captive Ball.\n Ramp  The ramp is shot by the left flipper, goes all the way around the back of\nthe playfield, and falls toward the right flipper rapidly.  The ramp\nscores one lap, two if after rolling over the left inlane or during\nmultiball.  Before the first multiball, the ramp also spots a target on\none of the four opponents.  A ball leaving the upper playfield returns via\nthe ramp, but does not score any laps.\n Right \"1-Lap\" target  Just to the right of the right ramp.  Scores one lap when\nlit.\n Right Inlane/Outlane  Metal, like TZ's right side, which makes this side the\nbigger drain victim.  Inlane lights left spinner, outlane lights your\nbonus.\n Race Standings area  Just above the flippers, this informs the player which\nracers have been challenged, and which others have been defeated.\n Manual Plunger  Used to shoot the ball toward the Green Machine targets.\nShooting the Hill Entrance is the Skill Shot; more on that later.\n\n\n(Upper) Playfield Description and Basic Rules\n\nThe ball is fed to the upper playfield via a magnet which rides the\nball upward.  The ball is then dropped for an easy feed to the left flipper.\nIf \"Freestyle\" is available, sending the ball to the upper playfield will\nactivate it once before the ball is dropped.\n\n\n Yellow Belly  A loop shot on the left side, which spots Yellow Belly when lit\n(all opponents spotted score 5OK).  You need only trip the entrance to the\nloop to get credit for it.\n \"A\" target  On the inside of the Yellow Belly loop.\n Lock Shot  Just to the right of the Yellow Belly loop.  It locks for multiball\nwhen lit, else kicking upward toward the Red Hot shot area.\n Green Machine  A standup target in the middle of the playfield, which is easily\nshootable from either flipper.  It can also be made by looping Blue Beard,\nthen holding up the right flipper.\n Blue Beard  A loop on the right side, similar to the Yellow Belly loop.\n \"B\" and \"C\" targets  On the inside of the Blue Beard loop.  Completing \"ABC\"\nextends the timer on the center post, and doubles the value of the Cycle\nJump (only for the current Hill trip).\n Upper Left Flipper  Tiny flipper, fed by the Lock Shot kickout.  It shoots Red\nHot and the Captive Ball.\n Red Hot  A shot to a hole in the upper left of the upper playfield, which spots\nRed Hot if lit.  It also scores Cycle Jump, and returns the ball to the\nlower playfield.\n Captive Ball  Spots one lap when shot.  Also used as the \"jackpot\" shot in\nmultiball.\n Red Hot drain  Located to the right of the upper left flipper, this hole will\nusually collect your ball if you miss Red Hot.  It drains the ball to the\nlower playfield.\n Center Post  Located between the two lower flippers, it effectively covers all\ncenter drains until the timer runs out.  Lights and sound tell you how\nlong you have left.  The post covers all drains (except from the Red Hot\narea), since there are no inlanes or outlanes.\n\n\n\"Freestyle\" Playfield: Area (on the backglass) with no flippers, just eight\ntargets, two corresponding to each opponent.  If any of the eight are lit,\na ball is kicked from the lower left of the playfield.  If it hits any of\nthe lit targets, that opponent is spotted for you, also scoring the 5OK\nfor clearing the opponent.  If not, tough.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nThe Skill Shot is to shoot the Hill Entrance directly from the plunge.\nIt awards 1OOK for the first Skill Shot (called \"Cycle Stunt\"), 2OOK, 3OOK etc.\nto a maximum of 5OOK.  In addition, it will advance your opponents.  A\nsuccessful Skill Shot will award the lowest possible of the following:\n\n Light an opponent.  Order of lighting is Green Machine, Blue Beard,\nYellow Belly, Red Hot.\n Light all remaining opponents for Freestyle.  Since the ball then goes to\nthe Hill, this also activates Freestyle once.\n Spot an opponent, in the same order as above.  The spot awards 5OK.\n\n\nIn all cases (except at the beginning of multiball), a Skill Shot will\nalso send the ball immediately up to the Hill.  If at the start of multiball, a\nSkill Shot will only award the points.\n\nLaps\n\nYou start the game with one lap spotted toward your total.  The total\nis increased by:\n\n A shot to the ramp, which is usually one lap.  The ramp is worth two laps\nduring multiball or if the left inlane was tripped before the shot.\n A shot to either of the \"1-Lap\" targets, which light after each trip to\nthe Hill.  When one is shot, both turn off.\n A shot to the Captive Ball on the upper playfield, which spots one lap.\n\n\nThe number of laps affects the value of the Captive Ball on the lower\nplayfield.  It starts at a value of 1OK, increases to 25K at 4 laps, and maxes\nout at 5OK after 7 laps.  A flexible number of laps (usually 8) lights an extra\nball at the lower Captive Ball.  25 laps awards \"Finish Line\", which is 75OK\nplus an extra ball.\n\nEach lap is also worth 1OK toward your end-of-ball bonus.  After\n\"Finish Line\", the number of laps is reset, but no extra ball is available at 8\nlaps the second time around.\n\nCycle Jump\n\nOn the upper playfield, the Red Hot hole will award a Cycle Jump.  The\nvalue of the Cycle Jump begins at 75K and increases by 25K for each Jump, with\na possible maximum of 2OOK (help!).  This value is not reset ball-to-ball.\n\nThe Cycle Jump value is doubled by shooting the \"ABC\" targets, and is\nonly temporarily doubled for that round on the Hill; the actual Cycle Jump\nvalue is never doubled.\n\nOpponents\n\nYou begin the race in Banzai Run in 6th place.  To win, you must light\nand then pass five opponents.  The first four are Green Machine, Blue Beard,\nYellow Belly, and Red Hot, and the fifth is the King of the Hill.\n\nThe first four opponents may be passed in any order.  To light any of\nthe four opponents on the Hill, you must complete the bank of three targets\ncorresponding to the opponent.  Any target can be spotted for you by shooting\nthe Bumper Saucer, or, before the first multiball, the Ramp.  The spotted\ntarget will be the one that most helps you complete an opponent's target bank;\nif you had 2 targets left on Yellow Belly and only one on Blue Beard, it would\nspot the final target on Blue Beard.\n\nWhen any opponent's target bank is completed, the game sexistly\ndeclares, \"He's going after _________,\" with the name of the completed opponent\nsaid.  If two or more target banks are completed in succession, the game says,\n\"He's going after __________ and _________!\"  Pretty cool there.  In addition,\nthe challenged racer flashes in the Race Standings area of the playfield.\n\nIf at least one racer is currently being challenged (ie the target bank\nhas been completed, but the racer has not been passed), then the Hill will be\nlit.  On the upper playfield, shooting the target corresponding to that racer\nwill pass the racer.  \"What a move on ________!\"  Any racer defeated awards\n5OK and solidly light that racer in the Race Standings area.  After the ball\nfalls to the lower playfield, you are updated on your place in the race.  \"He's\nmoved into fourth place.\"\n\nDefeating all flashing racers at once may not be such a great idea;\ndoing this closes the Hill until more racers have been challenged.\n\nWhen all four racers have been challenged (not necessarily defeated),\nthe banks of opponents' targets reset.  Targets are still spotted as before,\nbut instead of challenging the racer a second time, completing the bank lights\nthat opponent's targets on the \"Freestyle\" mini-playfield.  Then, upon any shot\nto the Hill or to the Bumper Saucer, the ball is kicked on the playfield.  This\nfeature is totally random; sometimes you'll get opponents for free that way,\nusually you won't.  Opponents are easy enough to defeat that it's no big deal.\n\nShould you light all the remaining opponents on the \"Freestyle\"\nplayfield, the targets reset themselves again.  This time, completing a bank of\ntargets defeats that opponent outright.\n\nWhen all four opponents have been defeated, the Lock Shot is lit\n_immediately_.  So if the final opponent was Yellow Belly, the Lock will be lit\nright there.  Otherwise, the game will tell you to \"Go for the hill!\" and start\nflashing things at you until you do.\n\nWhen the lock is finally made, you're ready for...\n\nMultiball\n\nAfter the Lock, the second ball is sent to the manual plunger; the\nSkill Shot is still available, but only for the points.  After the second ball\nhits a playfield targets, the ball in the Lock Shot kickout is kicked upward,\nbut since the upper playfield's flippers are disabled, it falls to the lower\nplayfield.  Throughout the multiball, the ramp is lit for 2 laps.\n\nThe object of multiball is to defeat the King of the Hill to win the\nrace.  First, either of the two balls must be shot into the Bumper Saucer,\nwhich flashes \"Time Lock\" throughout multiball.  With a ball in the lock, you\nhave about 2O seconds to defeat the King by shooting the Captive Ball on the\nupper playfield.  Shooting the ball scores 1M and gets you a whole buncha\nblinkin' lights; collecting \"ABC\" and then shooting the Captive Ball (you must\ndo both on the same trip to the Hill) scores 1M plus an Extra Ball.\n\nIf you fail to defeat the King on a trip to the Hill in multiball, the\nTime Lock timer continues to run (it is paused while a ball is on the Hill), so\nyou have enough time to shoot the Hill Entrance two or three times before the\nsecond ball is released.\n\nOnce the King has been defeated, even more points are available: for\nthe rest of multiball, the Ramp is lit for two laps as well as a 25OK \"Victory\nLap\".  The scoring from Victory Laps is potentially unlimited.\n\nAnd the music is tres cool.  Thank you, Brian Schmidt.\n\nAfter multiball, things return back to normal    the defeated riders\nare moved to \"Prior Race\" in the Race Standings area, so they can be remembered\nfor end-of-ball bonus.  In addition, the Ramp no longer spots opponent targets.\n\n End-of Ball Bonus\n\nYour end-of ball bonus is:\n1OK * (Number of laps) + 2OK * (Number of opponents defeated).\n\nLaps are carried ball-to-ball until 25 laps are accumulated (for Finish\nLine), then are reset.  Opponents are carried ball-to-ball until multiball has\nbeen achieved, then are reset after that ball    the opponents defeated before\nmultiball are still counted toward the end-of-ball bonus for that ball (which\nis why the defeated riders are moved to the \"Prior Race\" area in Race\nStandings).\n\nThere is no bonus multiplier.  Notice that the bonus is calculated only\nby numbers of particular targets hit; there's never just some mysterious\n\"Bonus\" number calculated behind your back.  Every Lawlor game is like this...\n\n\"Hill Closed\"\n\nBanzai Run uses a software compensation if the magnet heading to the\nHill isn't working.  Any shot to the Hill Entrance will spot a challenged\nopponent if lit (one per shot), lock the ball for multiball, and defeat the\nKing.  This means no Cycle Jumps or other cool stuff, but at least it doesn't\nkill the game.\n\nTips and Strategies\n\nTry to rack up the laps on the Ramp as early as possible.  In the\nearly stages of the game, the Ramp advances you toward multiball, adds to your\nbonus, adds to the Captive Ball value, and eventually lights an extra ball.\nAll in one handy dandy shot.  Get used to it.\n\nJust because an opponent is challenged on the Hill doesn't mean you\nhave to defeat them right away.  A better strategy is to shoot only for the\nCycle Jump until several opponents are available.  Don't forget the 2x Cycle\nJump, which can be worth a great deal later in the game.\n\nAfter the Ramp has been shot several times, the Captive Ball is worth\n5OK per shot, and it's an easy shot.  Pretty easy points, pretty safe as well.\n\nDon't bother with the 1-Lap targets; they're drain shots and you can\njust as easily get a lap from the Ramp.\n\nTry to defeat one of the lower three opponents last (ie get Red Hot as\nearly as possible), so that the Lock is immediately lit on the upper playfield.\nSaves a trip to the Hill.\n\nThe Freestyle playfield is fairly unimportant; don't work toward\nlighting opponents in Freestyle unless you're really bad at the upper playfield\nshots.  It's too much work for a chance shot at claiming an opponent when you\ncan just as easily just do it yourself.\n\nuhhh... uhh... head for the blinkin' lights.\n\n\nBragging? \n\n\nWell    as a 13 year old, I guess 7 million on this game was probably\npretty good.  I'm sure someone can do better, and I'm happy to put someone's\nhigh score in this sheet.\n\nBowen\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Banzai Run", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/banzairun.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Banzai Run", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Blitzer.\n\n Background\n\nBanzai Run is a race, and the objective of the game is to challenge 4\nracers ahead of you, defeat them, and then challenge and defeat the King of the\nHill.  You may notice that the announcer always uses the word \"he\" in referring\nto the player.  [PC griping deleted]\n\nBanzai Run has the most unusual playfield design I've ever come across in\nall my pinball years.  It takes the concept of multiple playfields to the\nextreme, putting the upper level on the backglass, and the LCD readouts up on\ntop of the playfield.  The upper level is nearly vertical, so the ball moves\nrather quickly and timing is the key to mastering the vertical layout.\n\nSpeaking of the LCDs, they are of the 7-digit, top-line-only-alphanumeric\ntype, so the highest score you can record is 10 million, after which the\ndisplay goes back to 0,000,000.  If you get 10 million or more, you\nautomatically get #1 on the high score board with a score of 9,999,999.\n\nI'll use the following abbreviations during your tour of Banzai Run: \"K\"\nfor a thousand, \"M\" for a million, \"LP\" for lower playfield, \"UP\" for upper\nplayfield, and \"w/l\" for when lit.\n\nParts of the playfield that are named (either by me or by the game) will\nbe capitalized so you know you can find info about them here.  (I try to be\nconsistent on this point...)\n\nI'm doing this sheet entirely from memory (except for a couple of things\nthat I got from Bowen's sheet [*growl* he beat me to it]), so forgive the\noccasional inaccuracies.  Anything I'm not sure of will be flagged with a\nquestion mark, and anything I stole, uh I mean borrowed, from Bowen will be my\nsecret.\n\nI'm sure Williams will get on my case if I don't mention that Banzai Run\nand Multiball are their copyrights.  The awesome playfield design is the\ntrademark of Pat Lawlor.  (I still wonder how he convinced Williams to make\nBanzai Run; that design must have cost major $$$ to build.)\n\nWhat's What and Where It Is:  Lower Playfield\n\nStarting at the lower left and going roughly clockwise, here's what you'll find\non the LP.\n\n\n Left inlane/outlane   The left outlane has a kickback (what's that doing on a\nLawlor pin?) and thus a nice big curved metal side.  It can also be lit for\na Special.  The Kickback is lit at the start of each ball, and is relit by\nthe Lock Saucer.  Sometimes, the Kickback will send the ball directly into\nthe Lock Saucer if it's in a generous mood.  The inlane lights the Right\nSpinner for 3K and the Ramp for 2 laps (both for a short time).\n\n Slingshot kicker   This is a vertical lane just to the right of the inlane.  If\nthe ball falls into it, the kicker at the bottom will send the ball straight\nback, and it usually hits the LP Captive Ball.  It helps to give the machine\na little shake just before the kicker activates to ensure the ball goes\nstraight.\n\n Left 1-Lap Standup   This is at the end of a short curved lane.  It awards one\nlap w/l.  This and the Right 1-Lap Standup are lit each time you come off\nthe UP, and both turn off when either is hit.  The ball comes out this lane\nwhen it leaves the UP and the Ramp.\n\n Blue and Red targets   The three Blue Beard racer standups are just above the\nexit to the just-mentioned lane, facing directly right.  The three Red Hot\ntargets are above them, also facing right.  See the rules on The Race for\nhow these targets function.\n\n Captive Ball   This can be hit from the Slingshot Kicker, or from the lower\nright flipper.  It has status lights to indicate its value: 10K (no lights),\n25K (lit after 3(?) laps), 50K (lit after 6(?) laps), Extra Ball (lights at\na varying value, between 6 and 8 laps as I recall).\n\n Left Spinner lane   The spinner is 1K per spin, or 3K w/l.  The spinner is lit\nby the right inlane.  The lane is very wide, and so very forgiving of errant\nshots.  The lane leads to the...\n\n Hill Saucer   Sends the ball to the UP w/l (the light is light orange and reads\n\"The Hill\").  When not lit, it kicks the ball over to the Green Machine\nrollover lanes.  This also serves as the Skill Shot, and activates the UP\nFreestyle playfield if any targets there are lit.  See the rules on The Race\nfor more info.  You can reach this Saucer by shooting the Right Spinner\nLane, but the ball never seemed to fall in for me.\n\n Yellow targets   One Yellow Belly racer standup is to the right of the Left\nSpinner Lane, and 2 others flank the open lane that leads to the Lock\nSaucer.\n\n Green Machine rollover lanes   The ball can reach the lanes by being kicked out\nof the Hill Saucer, being plunged here, or rolling up the Right Spinner\nLane.  The left 2 lanes lead down the the bumpers, and the far-right lane\nleads directly to the Right Spinner lane.  These lanes don't follow the\ntraditional use of top rollover lanes in that they don't count towards a\nbonus multiplier; they do score bonus points, though.\n\n Bumpers   3 of 'em, just below the Green Machine lanes.  They will usually\nfling the ball around for a while before letting it fall down.  Sometimes\nthey will kick the ball into the Lock Saucer, and other times the ball will\nbe kicked out of the lock saucer and be kicked right back in again.  Their\nvalue can't be increased (that comes in later Lawlor pins).\n\n Lock Saucer   This is placed just to the right of the center Green Machine\nlane.  It can be hit directly from the lower left flipper, but it is a very\nunforgiving shot; the open lane is barely wide enough to let the ball\nthrough.  Sometimes the Kickback will shoot the ball directly in here.\n\nHere's what it can score:\n\n Kickback:  Relights the Kickback.\n Lock:  Lit in Multiball before the King is defeated, and also lit to\nrestart Multiball if the King was not defeated before one ball\ndrained.  There are 2 different lights (Lock and Time Lock) but I\ndon't remember which light was lit when.\n Freestyle:  Lit if any targets on the UP Freestyle playfield are lit, and\nactivates that playfield when shot.\n\n\nThis saucer also spots a Racer Target when shot during one-ball play.\n\n Right Spinner lane   The spinner is 1K, or 3K w/l (it is lit by the left\ninlane).  The lane leads to the Green Machine Rollover lanes.  The ball can\nalso land in the Hill Saucer, but it never seemed to work for me.\n\n Upper Right Flipper   A full-sized flipper at the entrance to the Right Spinner\nlane.  I personally never use it, but if you choose to, it can hit almost\nany Blue, Red, or Yellow Racer Target, as well as the Captive Ball.\n\n The Ramp   The entrance is low, and can be shot with either lower flipper\n(backhands are tough, though).  It scores 1 lap, 2 laps w/l (lit for a short\ntime by the left inlane, and always lit during Multiball).  It has a flasher\nunderneath the plastic that indicates when a Victory Lap can be collected,\nand when the King can be defeated.  The exit to the Ramp is above the Left\n1-Lap Standup, and the ball usually falls right onto the lower right\nflipper.  Balls leaving the UP also fall onto the Ramp and exit the same way\n(but don't score a lap).\n\n Right 1-lap Standup   Just to the right of the Ramp entrance.  Functions like\nthe other 1-Lap Standup target.\n\n Right in/outlane   The outlane can be lit for a Special.  The inlane lights the\nLeft Spinner for 3K for a short time.\n\n Race Status Lights   Two rows of four lights each, color coded for the racers.\nThe bottom row indicates which racers are challenged (flashing) or defeated\n(steady) in the current race.  After Multiball ends, these lights will turn\noff and the four \"Previous Race\" lights will turn on, saving them for the\nend-of-ball bonus.  After the ball ends, the current race's status is saved,\nbut the previous race's lights turn off.  There are also lights indicating\nyour place in the race (6th to 1st).\n\n Plunger   A manual plunger.  The plunger lane leads to the Green Machine\nrollover lanes.  Hit the Hill Saucer from the plunger to score the Skill\nShot.\n\n Lower Flippers & Slingshots   2 of each, normal places, but the left slingshot\nis a bit wider than the right, to accommodate the kicker.  (Here is the first\nexample of Lawlor's fascination with unusual inlane configurations.)\n\n\nWhat's What and Where It Is:  Upper Playfield\n\nGoing from bottom to top, here's the layout of Banzai Hill.\n\n\n Entrance   The only way to reach the Hill is via the LP Hill Saucer.  When you\ndo, a mobile magnet comes down, picks up the ball, and drops it onto a metal\nlane that leads to the lower left flipper.  However, if any targets on the\nFreestyle playfield are lit, Freestyle will activate before the ball is\ndropped.  The ball can *always* be caught by the left flipper after it is\ndropped from the magnet.\n\n Lower flippers   These flippers raise to a far greater angle than your average\nLP flipper in order to get the ball to move up the vertical playfield.  Use\nthe regular flipper buttons to control them.  Passing between these flippers\nis possible.  To pass, wait until the ball is near the tip of a flipper,\nthen tap the flipper button.  The flipper should go about halfway up, and\nthe ball will land on the metal lane leading to the other flipper.\n\n Center Post   Completely blocks the gap between the Lower Flippers, and is\nalways lit after the ball is dropped off the magnet.  An orange \"Post Out\"\nlight will flash to indicate the timer on the post.\n\n Center Drain   Once the post's timer runs out, the ball can drain between the\nflippers and return to the LP.\n\n Yellow Belly   Defeats Yellow Belly w/l.  A looping lane that is easily\nbackhanded from the left flipper.  The exit from this lane is above the left\nflipper, so the ball will usually be catchable.\n\n Green Machine   Defeats Green Machine w/l.  A single standup target, facing\ndown, between the entrances to the Blue Beard and Lock lanes.  It can be hit\ndirectly from either flipper, and sometimes the ball will hit it after\nspeeding thru the Blue Beard lane if the right flipper is kept raised.  The\nball is very difficult to control after it hits this target.\n\n Blue Beard   Defeats Blue Beard w/l.  Another looping lane.  The ball exits\nthis lane via a long straight lane, much like the lane that guides the ball\naway from the magnet, but the ball will be moving faster and so will not\nusually be catchable by the right flipper.  It will either fly over to the\nleft flipper or hit the Green Machine target and bounce wildly.\n\n A-B-C Standups   A is located between the entrance and exit of Yellow Belly,\nand B and C are located between the entrance and exit of Blue Beard.\nHitting all 3 doubles the value of the Cycle Jump for that time on the Hill\n*only*, and lights Extra Ball during multiball, also for that time on the\nHill only.  The ball is sometimes controllable after a shot to any of these\ntargets, but no guarantees.\n\n Lock   This is a very long shot between Green Machine and the entrance to\nYellow Belly.  It can be hit with either flipper, but is a lot easier to hit\nwith the left flipper.  It is a U-shaped lane that leads to a kicker (and\nwhere the ball is held).  The kicker sends the ball up to the top\nmini-playfield, which consists of the Top Flipper, Top Drain, Captive Ball,\nand Red Hot.\n\n Top Flipper   A teeny-tiny flipper just big enough to hold the ball.  The ball\nwill always be catchable after it is kicked up from the Lock.\n\n Top Drain   A hole to the right of the Top Flipper.  It drains the ball back to\nthe LP.\n\n Captive Ball   Always scores 1 lap (although there's no light or text to tell\nyou that it does).  Defeats the King and scores an extra ball w/l.\n\n Cycle Jump/Red Hot   Another vertical lane with a bend to the left.  Defeats\nRed Hot w/l.  When not lit, it scores the current Cycle Jump value (doubled\nif A-B-C have been completed that time on the Hill).  The Cycle Jump starts\nat 75K(?) and increases 25K(?) per hit, and is saved between balls.  The\nball drains back to the LP after this shot is hit.\n\n Freestyle Playfield (or as I like to call it, the Pachinko Playfield)   This is\na totally separate playfield, with one ball, no flippers, and 8 targets (2\nfor each Racer).  If the ball hits any lit targets, the corresponding Racer\nis immediately spotted.  The path of the ball is totally unpredictable;\nsometimes it will fall back down in a split-second, other times it'll bounce\naround and collect a couple of Racers.  Go figure.\n\n\nOn to the rules....\n\nThe Race\n\nThe first stage of the Race involves the Racer Targets and the Hill.  To\nchallenge a Racer, complete all 3 of the Racer's targets.  Doing so lights the\nRacer on the UP with a flashing light.  Other ways to spot a Racer Target are\nthe Lock Saucer and the Ramp (for the 1st race only).\n\nYou can challenge the racers in any order, and you can defeat the\nchallenged racers in any order.  Once all 4 racers have been challenged (but\nnot all of them defeated), the non-defeated Racers' targets will reset and\nlight again.  Completing a bank of targets will light 1 of the corresponding\nRacer's targets on the Pachinko Playfield.\n\nIf all non-defeated Racers targets have been lit on the Pachinko\nPlayfield, the Racers' targets will reset and flash very quickly.  Completing\nthem again will defeat the corresponding Racer.\n\nDefeating all 4 racers (no matter how) immediately lights the UP lock.\nSo, if you hit the Yellow Belly loop to defeat him, and he's the 4th racer you\ndefeat, you can shoot the Lock right away.\n\nIf, after lighting the UP Lock, you hit all 12 Racer targets, the Lock at\nthe LP Lock Saucer lights.\n\nShoot the Lock to start....\n\nMultiball\n\nWhen you lock the ball, the 2nd ball is served to the Plunger, and the\nSkill Shot is available.  When that ball hits something, the locked ball is\nkicked out and drains to the LP.\n\nThe goal is to lock one ball in the LP Lock Saucer.  Listen for the\nannouncer to say \"Go for the Hill!\" to tell when a ball is locked.  The Hill is\nthen lit on a timer; if you don't hit the Hill Saucer within about 12 seconds,\nthe locked ball is kicked out and must be re-locked.\n\nOnce you get to the Hill, there is one thing to do:  hit the UP Captive\nBall to defeat the King for 1M and a noisy light show.  (If you feel greedy,\nhitting ABC lights the UP Captive Ball for an extra ball.  See what greed will\nget you?)\n\nIf you drain from the UP without defeating the King, the locked ball is\nimmediately kicked out and must be re-locked.\n\nIf you manage to hit all 12 Racer Targets, the announcer says \"Go for the\nRamp!\"  Forget about the Lock now, just hit the ramp to defeat the King.\n\nAfter you defeat the King, hit the Ramp for a Victory Lap bonus of 250K.\nYou can get Victory Laps as long as 2 balls are in play.  Once one ball drains,\nyou can get only one more Victory Lap.\n\nIf you drain one ball from the LP without defeating the King, shoot the LP\nLock Saucer within 20 seconds to restart Multiball.  You can restart Multiball\nonly once per race.\n\n Other Assorted Stuff \n\n\n Skill Shot   Shooting the Hill Saucer from the Plunger awards the Skill Shot,\nwhich is 100K the first time, 200K the second, up to a max of 500K(? on\nthese values).  The Skill Shot will also challenge a Racer, or light a\ntarget on the Freestyle playfield if all Racers are challenged, or defeat a\nRacer if all possible Freestyle targets are lit.  (In short, it's worth\ngoing for.)  The ball must be plunged at less than full strength, but if you\nhit the plunger with the heel of your palm, the ball may bounce into the\nHill Saucer anyhow.  Hitting the Skill Shot at the start of Multiball awards\nonly the points.\n\n Laps   You start with 1 lap, and can earn laps via the Ramp, the UP Captive\nBall, and the 1-Lap Standups.  Laps advance the LP Captive Ball's value, and\ngetting 25 Laps awards the Finish Line bonus of 750K and an extra ball.  I\ndon't remember what happens after you reach the Finish Line.  The counter\nmay reset (as Bowen says) but I can't say one way or the other.\n\n Extra balls   Banzai Run is pretty stingy with its extra balls.  The EB at the\nLP Captive ball stays lit until collected, and the Finish Line awards an EB,\nbut the UP Captive Ball EB is hidden (i.e., not explained anywhere on the\nmachine).\n\n Special   Defeating all Racers twice lights the outlanes.  One outlane at a\ntime is lit.  I'm not sure if they disappear after one ball (the specials,\nthat is, not the outlanes) or if they stay lit until collected.\n\n Fun With Bonus (I love that name! :) )   10K for each lap, and 20K for each\ndefeated Racer.  If you defeat all the Racers twice on one ball, you only\nget credit for having defeated them once.  (BOO!)\n\n Other scoring   Defeating a Racer scores 50K.  Locking a ball to either start\nor restart Multiball is 100K.\n\n Danger  flying balls:  If the ball somehow manages to fall off the UP without\ngoing thru one of the 3 drains, the game will realize this and give you\nanother ball (with the display: \"Super Jump, Shoot Again\").  (CHEER!)\n\n Cows   Nope, no cows...I just felt like saying \"cow.\"\n\n\nStrategies\n\nI concentrate on getting laps right away.  Once you get the hang of the\nRamp, you can get the extra ball pretty quickly.  After that, well, go for the\nhill!\n\nDon't beat Red Hot last; it'll save you a trip up the Hill.\n\nHit the ABC targets right away, before the post times out.  It's hard to\ncontrol the ball after hitting these targets, and rather easy to control a shot\nto either the Yellow Belly or Blue Beard loops.  Besides, ABC increases the\nCycle Jump or lights an extra ball.  Of course, if you are just shooting the\nLock, don't fool around with the targets.\n\nThe most important thing to master on the UP is timing.  If you've\nalready gotten a replay and want to practice your timing, try to shoot Blue\nBeard or the Lock without catching the ball as it rolls off the magnet.  An\neven tougher shot is hitting the Lock with the right flipper.  The tiny flipper\nshots are tough as well; I never could hit the UP Captive Ball with any\nregularity.\n\nBragging\n\nWell, since Bowen did it, I'll do it too ;>  I never played a marathon\nmulti-million game; I usually stopped after 10M points.  But I did break 10M\nnumerous times.\n\nClosing Credits\n\nWell, I hope this rule sheet helps you out :>  If you have comments,\ncorrections, or Xmas cards, mail 'em to me at any of the addresses at the top\nof this rule sheet (preferably the Internet address).\n\nI didn't really steal too much from Bowen :>  Just the names for Red Hot\nand Blue Beard, and a coupla other little scoring details.  (honest!)\n\nLive long and prosper.  Hasta la vista, baby.\n\n[fade to black]\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Banzai Run", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/banzairun2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Banzai Run", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Search them out and send input!  I am mostly weak on random awards\nand the scoring end of things...\n\nCredits\n\nWritten by Lee Van Doren\n\nSpecial thanks to the FSPA (Free State Pinball Association) and\nespecially our N. Baltimore League, where this machine is made\navailable to us by Weiner Distributing.\n\nAdditional Input from RGP folks:\n\n Aaron Mandel\n\n\nRecent Changes\n\n\n 0.5: 10/12/96: Rough Draft - Completely from memory.\n 1.0: 10/26/96: Additional Input Received\n\n\nSummary\n\nBarb Wire is based on a movie starring Pamela Anderson Lee.  I\nhaven't seen the movie so I can't comment on how well it correlates.\nThis was the last production pinball machine by Premier under the\nGottlieb name.  Another game followed which only was in test at the\ntime the Gottlieb line was shut down.  It was a machine based on\nBrooks & Dunn country music stars?\n\nI personally feel that this is a decent machine for a Premier/Gottlieb.\nThe game play is reasonable, especially for novices but the excitement\ndefinately lacks due to simplistic rules.  I would give it a B-.\n\nBackground\nRent the movie...\n\nPlayfield\n\nHere's the various playfield parts, starting from the plunger lane\nand working clockwise.  (* = Arrow Shot)\n\n\n Plunger \nDual plunger; the manual plunger when pulled back enough, sends\nthe ball up and around to one of the left flippers, usually\nthe lower one.  An autoplunger is also there for ballsavers\nand Multiballs, however it doesn't shoot the ball hard enough to\ncome around to the left flippers so the ball drops back into\nthe lower kickout hole for kickout.\n Outlanes \nPart of a rotating extra ball award when lit.  (Rotated with\nflippers)\n Inlanes \nPart of a rotating extra ball award when lit.  (Rotated with\nflippers)\nEach inlane lights the opposing ramp for a Missile shot (combo\naward)?\n Flippers \nThe usual two, in the usual places. Center post too.\nTypical Premier/Gottlieb catch-all flippers.\n Slingshots \nStandard, just like the flippers.  Can be active for 10M a\nsling (see Retina Scan)\n Kick Target * \nA target that kicks the ball back.\n Upper Flipper \nStandard size\n Captive Ball * \nAbove the flipper, hits here feed the flipper.  Also an arrow\nshot, also lights right ramp for Missile.\n Retina Scan * \nA kickout hole.\nStarts game lit, any switch after eject relights it.\nAwards Retina Scan (Mystery) when lit and no rounds going\n...see below...  Also an arrow shot.\n Left Orbit * \nFeeds to pops.  Also awards a lens target during Hammerhead Bar.\n Left Ramp * \nCollects Missile combo when lit.  Lit for Add-a-ball at the start\nof every multiball mode.\n Big Fatso * \nDoor that raises and lowers to reveal a hole.\nOpen for Skill Shot at start of every ball. \nAlso starts rounds (see below).\nAlso awards Mega Bonus when activated by right lower target.\nAlso used in various modes.  In some cases the opening and\nclosing alternate, in others he stays open for a period of time.\n Right Ramp * \nAwards Missile combo when lit.  Advances Toll value 5M or 2M if\nCrash the Tolls has been played once.\n Pop Bumpers \nI believe two of them with a kickback target.  Scores something\nper hit but advances cursor along BARB WIRE letters, awarding\nletter if not lit when pops are complete and ball feeds into\nright kickout hole.  Pressing both flippers locks cursor on\nletter and prevents advancing.  Collecting all letters awards\nSuper Jackpot.  Lit letters carry from GAME TO GAME!  Hence, this\nis not active in Tournament Mode.\n Lens Targets \nFour targets.  Completing targets lights targets for 20M each\nfor 20? seconds.  Targets reset each ball.  Also used in\nHammerhead Bar round.\n Lower Right Kickout Hole * \nAwards Mind Read.  After about 5? shots extra ball is lit.\n[Info needed on subsequent awards]\nWarning: poor design here on most machines which causes\nkickout to be dangerously close to between the flippers.\nNote you will often want to get in the habit of manually\nplunging balls for multiball because of this.\n Lower Right Target * \nHitting target lights Mega Bonus at Big Fatso and advances Mega\nBonus 30M.  Big Fatso alternates open and close for about 15\nseconds.  Shooting in the hole awards Mega Bonus which is\nsignificant, 30M + 30M each advance.\n\n\nGeneral Rules\n\nNo novice/expert mode (at least not by default settings).\nTournament mode can be started by holding both flippers a few\nseconds before starting (see below for specifics).\n\nBuy In is enabled in default settings.  You can buy up\nto (standard??) extra balls (25c each); there is no separate\nbuy-in high score board.\n\nSoftware Changes: None known at this time...\n\nGenerally, you start Rounds (modes) and complete them.  See strategy\nbelow.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nShoot ball with full plunger shot to feed left flipper.  Big Fatso\nis open for skill shot.  Hitting shot awards HAYWIRE letter.  (First\nletter is spotted at start of game in normal settings).\n\nCollecting Triangle/Arrow Awards\n\nAs something to do when you have nothing else to do... There is\na triangle on the playfield of various value awards (5M to 100M).\nAll major shots are lit at the start of the game.  Scoring a shot\nawards the current triangle value if it is not lit.  I believe\nslings advance the award?  When all shots are completed they relight.\nWhen triangle is completed, Firefight starts.  This is a 3 ball multiball\nmode where three wandering shots are lit for a jackpot including lens\ntargets.  Mode continues until one ball is left.\n\nAfter all arrows are completed, only half relight.  When one is scored,\nthe next arrow to the right relights.  When those are all scored, then\nonly two arrows are lit at a time on the playfield.  There is some\nbehavior where a shot can be completely inactive if the arrow for that\nshot is not lit...\n\nThe only use of this really is to get the 100M value that is lit on\nyour first shot of the game.  If you don't get it, don't worry, you\nwill by accident eventually.\n\nSuper Jackpot Value\n\nStarts at 300M I believe?  Advancing super jackpot happens as an\naward at Retina Scan (anywhere else?).  Super Jackpot is scored\nfrom Pops in completing BARB WIRE or is awarded in Hideout round.\n\nROUNDS:\n\nFirst shot of the game to Big Fatso lights it for \"Start Round\".\nShooting it when Start Round is lit opens the hole.  Shooting it when\nopen starts lit Round.  Each subsequent completed cycle of Rounds\nrequires one additional hit to light Start Round.\n\nDuring all mutliball rounds, ball saver stays on for a LONG time (about 20\nseconds).  Two balls are initially plunged but also, the left ramp is\nlit for add-a-ball for one additional ball.  Try to get this while ball\nsaver is active so you can get three balls going right away.\n\nHideout\n\nOnly non-multiball round.  Big Fatso, Retina Scan hole, and Mind Read\nhole are lit.  Note you can score the Mind Read hole from behind fed\nby the pops.  Score each to provide choice of taking current award\nor trying to score either shot to award next award.  After three shots\nare completed, award is given and mode ends.  Order of awards are:\nAdv. Multipler, Extra Ball, Super Jackpot, Double Your Score, ...?\n\nBig Fatso\n\nMultiball round.  He opens and closes alternately\nthroughout the round.  Each switch toggles his scoring value between\n10M, 20M, 50M, 100M, and 200M.  Since this mode lasts as long as you\nkeep the balls alive, the potential scoring is unlimited, but it's\nharder than it sounds.  Requires good ball control and patience.\n\nCrash the Tolls\n\nOne ball round.  If no round is started (except Hideout) by the start of\nthe third ball, this round is automatically started.  Shoot arrow shots\nto collect current toll value.  Shoot right ramp to advance toll value 20M\nduring the round.  When all arrows are completed and you still have more\nthan one ball, shoot Big Fatso for super jackpot.  If super jackpot is\nscored, then the round recycles.\n\nHammerhead Bar\n\n\"Music!\", also a multiball round.  Complete lens targets first, then\neach target scores 20M for rest of the round.  After 5 are scored,\nextra ball is awarded.  Shooting left orbit also awards a lens target.\n\nHaywire\n\nWizard Mode.  After completing other 4 rounds, this one is lit.  Also\na multiball round.  You must shoot one of a roving pair of arrow shots\nto collect a HAYWIRE letter (adding onto letters you have collected\nduring the game from skill shot or Retina Scan).  Once letters are\ncompleted before you are down to one ball, you advance to the final\nHAYWIRE frenzy.  All shots are lit, ball saver is on for a humongously\nlong time (45 seconds?) and you get 4 balls.  As you shoot shots a\nbonus value is raised.  Once it reaches 990M, Big Fatso opens and\nyou must shoot him to award it.  Strange behavior here?  If your round\nhasn't timed out yet (ball saver) you don't score it, until it does\ntime out.  After the bonus is scored, the arrow shots relight and you\ncontinue but with no ball saver.  Once you work the value up to 990M,\nyou can score it again... and again...  Once you are down to one ball,\nBig Fatso is open for 20? seconds to score the current value and then\nthe round ends.  Easily where all the points are!\n\nIf you fail to collect the HAYWIRE letters, the round ends but you keep\nyour letters...\n\nNOTE!!!:  If you collect all the HAYWIRE letters at any point in the\ngame, you instantly start Haywire frenzy.  SOOOO... if you screw up your\nHaywire round, try and collect the rest of the letters (through skill\nshot or...  Retina Scan) to start Haywire frenzy.\n\nCombos\n\nThere is a combo cycle that can start from a shot that feeds any flipper.\nIt starts at the appropriate shot for that flipper and continues through\nthe cycle.  The awards I am not sure of, but are something like 5M + 5M\neach combo?  Cycle is:\n\nRight Ramp, Left Ramp, Right Ramp, Left Orbit.\n\nAlso a combo for shooting captive ball after right inlane. (10M+10M?)\n\nRetina Scan (Mystery) Awards\n\n\n Award HAYWIRE letter\n Advance Multiplier\n Slings award 10M\n Award Triangle Value (moves 5? spots and awards value)\n Light Extra Ball\n Extra Ball (very rare)\n Zilch\n X Million\n Advance Mega Bonus (30M)\n 3 Jackpots\n Reveal Match Number\n\n\n Bonus\n\nAt the end of the ball, I think the bonus is just the toll value.\n\nThis bonus is then multiplied by the current bonus multiplier\nwhich is not held.  It can be 2X or 3X.\n\nExtra Balls \n\nThere are many ways to collect extra balls in this game:\n\n\n Hideout Round\n Hammerhead Bar Round\n Retina Scan to Light EB\n Mind Read to Light EB\n\n\nLight EB cycles the EB lit among the inlanes and outlanes via flippers.\n\nTournament Mode\n\nHold both flippers before starting game for about 5 seconds.  The\nscreen will say \"TOURNAMENT MODE ENABLED--PRESS START\".  Press start!\nTournament mode will be on for all players.  This is CRITICAL for\nleague play due to disabling the unfair BARB WIRE super jackpot.\nIf you forget, make sure you keep an eye out for someone scoring that\nand deduct it from their score.\n\nTournament mode disables the BARB WIRE award and gives 50M in lieu of\nan extra ball and 200M in lieu of a Special.\n\nStrategy \n\nNot much to it!  Complete the rounds, do as best you can and get to\nHaywire round, that's where the points are.  If you screw it up, use\nRetina Scan repeatedly to get those last HAYWIRE letters.\n\nOnce you complete the first cycle of rounds, get to Hideout round,\ngo all the way for the Double Your Score.  Voila!  You have about\n4-5B+ at this point.  Also, on your first Hideout, go for Extra Ball\nif not in tournament mode, otherwise, go for Super Jackpot.\n\nEverything else in the game is pointless... sorry!  A good score is\nover 1B.  A wizard score is 3B+...\n\nAny questions or additions, please email me!!

Now they are\nbased on A2.00 roms.\n\nBF seems to be a very well rounded game and is exciting to play.  Ball\nmovement is fast, but not uncontrollable.  There are lots of shots, none\nof which are impossible to make, but some that are rather hard.\nFurthermore, the shots smoothly blend into one another.  Overall, I think\nthis game is one of the better Sega's (Data East's) to come out in a while.\n\nThe replay reflex isn't too bad (200 Million, until it reflexes by a\nBillion!  I'm serious... after many replays (or getting the GC) it\nseemed to increment by 1 Billion on me!)\n\nThe graphics are excellent and the soundtrack is fabulous.\n\nThe only problem I've had with the game is that it was hard to know what to\naim for in modes because the DMD is the only thing which tells you what to\ndo (and I tended to be too busy to read the DMD while playing).  Granted,\nthings flash, but the playfield is so busy it is sometimes hard to know what\nto shoot for (this will especially be so when the lights burn out!).\n\nFurthermore, as in most recent Sega's the Extra Ball Buy-in must be\nenabled.  This is done by pressing the league play button after starting\na game.\n\nLastly, deathsaves are pretty easy.  I can regularly do them with just my\nforearm strength.  Yes, I do tilt often... but they are not hard to do.\nIn fact, this is probably the easiest machine to death save on that\nI've ever encountered. (Just don't do it when you have 20X Bonus! - Tilt\nthat is)\n\nPrototype Irregularities\n\nThe autoplunger is in the shape of a gun handle.  On this prototype it is a\nJP handle.  It even has the \"JP\" written on the handle!  Because of this,\nthere is an extra button on the handle (Smart Bomb from JP) which isn't\nutilized and won't be on the final product.\n\nSince my last writing, Sega must have sent the real handle to this\narcade as it is now on the machine.  Very slick looking.  However, it\nseems to be made of a rather weak plastic... I would assume it could\nbreak rather easily!!! (Soft, not brittle)\n\nAlso, with A0.50 roms when you cancel the buy-in the DMD displays \"DC\nEFFECT\".  I'm assuming this rom is missing a graphic which would be put\nthere.  Furthermore, collecting the bat gadgets doesn't exist in A0.50 roms.\n\nThings to Fix\n\nFirst, as with many Sega/DE products (,that I've encountered anyway,) the\nkickback doesn't work reliably.  (SEGA... LOOK AT A NEW DESIGN OR SOMETHING.\nPLEASE!!!)\n\nSecond, I've heard that the mode start saucer is supposed to eject the ball\nwith enough force to send it out the right orbit entrance and past the\nmiddle flipper.  On the prototype machine the ball is only ejected with\nenough force for it to reach the lane change area.  Regardless, the flow of\nthe game is not interrupted.  Note: This was roughly fixed with A2.00 roms.\nNow the ball never dribbles out the left orbit entrance and half the time\nmakes it back out the right orbit entrance (The other half it ends up in\nthe B-A-T Lanes).\n\nThird, occasionally the ball seems to fall out of the left habitrail (the\none leading to the left flipper) just above the slingshot.  This occurs\nboth when the ball is headed toward the inlane, or the batwing.  The reason\nit happens is because the habit trail becomes just two wires near the\nslingshot.  Thus, any unstable movement of the ball (like if it's moving\nvery fast) causes it to fall off!  This could be fixed by adding siderails\nto the habit trails in that area or widening the gap between the two rails\nsuch that the pinball rests lower in the habit trail.\n\nFourth, (and I believe this shouldn't occur. At least I can't tell why\nit does occur and I've looked for mechanical parts that would cause it)\nsometimes a right orbit shot gets stopped about 3-5 inches up past the\nmiddle flipper.  I can't figure out why... but it does.\n\nFifth, the software (maybe the hardware causes it) seems to lose track of\nthe number of balls occasionally.  (Normally when a ball enters the VUK\nand gets kicked up but not with enough force such that it lands back in the\nVUK.)  This can result in something favorable such as an unearned multiball\n(without jackpots available) or something undesirable such as more than one\nball in play and when one drains the bonus starts.\n\nSixth, occasionally the mini-ramp doesn't register a completed shot.  This\nis quite annoying (especially when an extra ball is lit).\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nDescription\n\nAs per usual this starts at the bottom middle and proceeds clockwise around\nthe game.\n\n\n Flippers  Two flippers in the usual location.\n\n Left Outlane  has a kickback called \"Laser Kick\".  Their is a great still\ngraphic on the DMD of Robin doing a karate kick and saying \"Hey, I just\nsaved your life!  You owe me one.\"\n\n Left Inlane  marked as \"X2\" on the playfield (in paint, not a light)\n\n Left Slingshot  another strange trapezoidal shape ala STTNG.\n\n Batwing  a gun-type thing resembling the left STTNG cannon in function,\nand amazingly looking like the batwing.\n\n Bat Drop Targets  Just above the left slingshot and almost parallel to the\ncabinet.  There are 4 of these.  From the bottom one up they spell C-A-V-E.\n\n Swooping Habit Trail  This starts just above the bat drop targets and goes\ntoward the player, below and around the flippers, and spits the ball out\ntowards the mini ramp.  The ball is propelled by a solenoid. (Like a slanted\nVUK).\n\n Left Orbit  Swoops around to the entrance to the right orbit.\n\n The Bat Cave  a plastic decoration which has a habit trail leading into and\nout of it.  It badly obscures much of the upper left playfield.\n\n Left Ramp  used to feed the ball to the batwing (when armed (i.e.\n\"enabled\")) or the left flipper.  Its orientation on the playfield reminds\nme of the left ramp on IJ.\n\n Middle Ramp (labeled Arkham Asylum)  necessary to arm the batwing, this ramp\ncan only be made from the 3rd flipper.  It is located directly above the\nleft ramp and positioned on the playfield similar to the middle ramp in\nWhirlwind.\n\n Two-Face Targets  a pair of targets located above the middle ramp\nentrance facing diagonally down right. One target is Two-Face's good\nside, the other his bad side.\n\n Pop Bumpers  3 of them located in the left middle upper quadrant of the\nplayfield.\n\n B-A-T Lanes  Located above the bumpers.  Advances multiplier and relights\nLaser Kick (possibly more?)\n\n Mode Start Saucer  Located in the back left corner of the cabinet it is\nonly accessible from a right orbit shot.  It should eject such that\nthe ball falls down the right orbit or into the B-A-T lanes.\n\n U-Turn Loop (aka Mini-Ramp)  located to the right of the bumpers this is a\nslight ramps (1\") which then sends the ball in a U-turn around the VUK and\nRight ramp to the right orbit and down to the 3rd flipper.  This shot is\nnecessary to arm the batwing.  Also used as a counter to light the Mr. E\nAward.\n\n VUK  Locks balls, awards Mr. E (when lit), and is a bat signal shot.\nSends the ball via a habit trail to the bat cave.\n\n Right Ramp  just to the right of the VUK it returns the ball to the right\nflipper.  This shot is necessary to arm the batwing.\n\n Right Orbit  swoops around toward the left orbit... usually enters the\nB-A-T Lanes or the upper left saucer.  (Only on the prototype have I ever\nhad the ball exit via the left orbit, ie. a full loop.)\n\n Middle Flipper (3rd)  Located along the edge of the right orbit similar in\nposition to the 3rd flipper on STTNG.\n\n Two-Face Targets  a pair of targets located below the middle flipper and\nabove the right slingshot.\n\n Right Outlane  nothing special... but has a special light.\n\n Rightmost Right Inlane  Scores Double Batwing when lit\n\n Leftmost Right Inlane  awards 2 batarangs when lit\n\n Left Slingshot  the normal triangular shape.\n\n Question Mark Targets  there are 5 of these located on the playfield.  One\non each side of the entrance to the Left and Right Ramps (i.e. 4) and 1 on\nthe left side of the entrance to the U-Turn loop.  These targets are used\nto enable modes.\n\n\nBat Signal Shots\n\nThese shots when completed will start Circus Countdown.  The 7 Shots are:\n\n\n     Left Orbit\n     Left Ramp\n     U-Turn Loop\n     Right Ramp\n     VUK\n     Middle Ramp\n     Right Orbit\n\n\nIt should also be noted that these shots must be completed when the\nbatsignal is blinking for it to become lit.  The first completed shot\nscore 5 Million.  Each subsequent shot scores 10, then 15, etc Million.\n\nThe batsignals remain lit from ball to ball until all have been collected.\n\nJackpot Shots\n\nDuring Multiball the Left Ramp saves Chase and the Right Ramp saves Robin.\nOnce completed the middle ramp is lit for Double Jackpot.  Then, the batwing\nmust be loaded (it is automatically enabled) and the ball must be shot up\nthe mini-ramp for a Super Jackpot.\n\nThe special is lit after collecting the Double Jackpot (I believe).\n\nBatwing Shots\n\nThe shots that are lit for targeting from the batwing are:\n\n\n     Mini-ramp    \\\n     VUK          |-->  all pictured as a bat symbol on the DMD\n     Right Ramp   |\n     Right Orbit  /\n     Three Question Mark targets: left of VUK and on both sides of right\nramp entrance.  --> These are pictured as \"?\" on the DMD\n\n\nThese shots are worth 10 Million each (unless doubled)\n\nI haven't noticed anything special occurring upon getting all the shots\nfrom the batwing even though once a shot is completed from the batwing\nit doesn't show up on the DMD anymore.  Hmmm?\n\nThe Cabinet\n\nIt is a widebody.  The artwork is fantastic.  Very realistic and keeping\nwith the dark \"batman mood\".\n\nSkill Shot\n\nPull the trigger and collect what is displayed on the DMD.  Awards I've seen\nare:\n\n\n     25 Million\n     Start Gotham Scene\n     Mr. E Award\n     2X Bonus\n     Two-Face Pops (2 Million a pop)\n     ...\n\n\nRules\n\nTo start a Gotham Scene (mode) you must either select it from the skill shot\n(the easiest) or hit all the Question Mark targets scattered around the\nplayfield (to enable the mode) and then the right orbit (to start the mode).\n\nAlso, you can lock the lit scene (or unlock it) by firing the gun (plunger).\nThis proves to be a very lucrative feature as you can lock in the Lite Extra\nBall mode! (Just like in Guns 'n Roses)\n\nBatarangs\n\nA new name for the Picard Manuever from STTNG.  Shoot the left orbit and\nthen the middle ramp.  There is an ego award for the most batarangs (in a\nrow? on one ball.) i.e. you get to put in your initials.  However, rarely\nhave I seen this show during attract mode... and never during instant info.\n\nGotham Scenes\n\nThe Gotham Scenes are the modes for this game.  They are changed via bumper\nhits. (Is their any other way?)  However, during a mode you can't start\nanother mode.  Nor can you see what mode is lit to become next (by bumper\nhits).  It may not even change during a mode.  I haven't been able to tell\nyet.\n\nThe Gotham Scenes are:\n\n\n Rooftop Chase  a video mode where you steer the batmobile around obstacles.\n(first on a rooftop), then you must steer it into points (up the side of a\nbuilding) then across another roof avoiding obstacles.  (kind of a strange\none to steer... you'll know what I mean when you play it)  >100 Million if\ncompleted.  Also, the obstacles do not come randomly.  Just like STTNG\nthe paths never change.  However, unlike STTNG their are no diverging paths.\n\n Face Two-Face  Hit the lit Two-Face targets 2 times each (usually the pair\non the right side of the machine, maybe always?) (though I believe any\ntwo-face target will work??? maybe the software just doesn't light the\nother targets?)\n\n Crime Spree  build up a jackpot with switch closures and collect at right\nramp.  The jackpot can be collected multiple times while the timer is\nrunning.\n\n ???  yes it is actually called \"???\" Anyway, this is a timed mode where all\none must do is hit the Question Mark targets to collect points.  Any\nQuestion Mark target will do, and they can be hit repeatedly.\n\n Safe Trap  hit all four ramps.\n\n Lite Extra Ball  duh...\n\n Brain Drain  Spell C-A-V-E in sequence.  Very hard to do but worth it as\na hurry-up extra ball can be collected at the mini-ramp.\n\n\nCoin Matching\n\nDone by hitting both good faces or bad faces in a row.  Once matched the\nplayfield light representing coin matches stays lit for the game or the\nsoftware remembers that you've matched.\n\nAwards are (Based on hits in a row):\n\n\nGood then Bad (or Bad then Good) relights laser kick and awards 10 Million.\nBoth good faces awards hold bonus.\nBoth bad faces awards 22 Million.\n\nAfter the second hit, the 3rd hit counts as a first hit (i.e. you can't\ncollect both good faces and one bad face to get Hold Bonus, 10 Million,\nand a relit laser kick!)\n\nMr. E Awards\n\n(Notice the pun ---> \"mystery\")\n\nLit by hitting the mini-ramp twice, then 3 more times, then ... (may be\nflexible, the DMD will tell you how many mini ramp shots till next lit).\nAwarded by entering the lit VUK or as a skill shot.\n\nThe possible awards are:\n\n\n     20 X Bonus (Very lucrative.. I got 860 Million once)\n     Mega Pops (3 Million a pop)\n     Super Laser Kick (unlimited kick back)\n     Light Extra Ball\n     Extra Ball\n     Start Gotham Scene\n     10 Million\n     20 Million\n     50 Million\n ??? Light Special ???\n ??? possibly more ???\n\n\nBat Gadgets\n\nWhen the right orbit is not lit to start a Gotham Scene a strong shot which\nends up in the saucer will cause a DMD display similar to the Snack Bar in\nCFTBL which will award various Bat Gadgets.  Once all (or is it just 4?) are\ncollected Super Laser Kick is awarded.\n\nCircus Coundown\n\nUpon lighting all batsignals a countdown starts at 99 Million.  Shoot\nthe right orbit to collect.\n\nDuring this mode, there is a great graphic of Two-Face and Robin.  The\ncountdown represents the bomb seen at the circus where Robin's parents died.\n\nMultiball\n\nA four ball Multiball; shoot the left and right ramp to collect jackpots\nthen the middle ramp for a Double jackpot (> Light Special ??).  Then load\nthe batwing (it is enabled) and shoot the mini-ramp for a Super Jackpot.\n(This is an extremely hard shot.  I've only made it once, and that was by\nsheer luck.  I was holding a trapped ball on my left flipper (planning on\nshooting that up the mini-ramp while I fired the batwing to try and trick\nthe software) and when I fired I made my left flipper shot and I made the\nbatwing shot!!!  (Let this forevermore be known as the Tiesma maneuver???\nright.. :P  ))\n\nForever\n\nThe Wizard Award....\n\nIt is started by matching both the good and bad heads... sighting all bat\nsignals and having completed all gotham events.  After doing so, \"FOREVER\"\nis lit to be collected via the regular Mode Start routes.  The beginning is\na great graphic of the riddler which I didn't get to watch very long as\nall the balls just started spewing out.  Thus, also, I was not aware if\nanything else was occurring (such as Mega Pops, lit special, etc).\n\nThis is a 4 ball multiball mode with a ? second ballsaver.  The object is\nto load the batwing to collect jackpots.  The problem is that the batwing\nis moving.  Thus, you may hit the left ramp but if the batwing isn't in the\nright position - No jackpot.  Really it's quite ingenious, and very fun!\nThe mode ends when less than two balls are in play.\n\nBonus\n\nThe bonus maxes out at 20X after which a score of 20 Million is added for\neach additional completion of the B-A-T Lanes.\n\nAt 2X bonus the Laser Kick is relit (and possibly each additional increase?)\n\nIt is tallied this way - ????\n\nAlso, there is a great graphic of Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) during\nthe bonus count.\n\nExtra Balls\n\nCan be lit via:\n\n\n     the Gotham Scene (Light Extra Ball),\n     a Mr. E Award, or\n ? some number  of shots to some ramp or orbit - but I haven't solved\nwhich yet.\n\n\nWhen lit it is collected at the mini-ramp and Two-Face says \"Live from the\n???;  Here's your extra ball.\"\n\nAlso, an extra ball can be awarded from the Mr. E award (and possibly the\nvideo mode, though I haven't seen it there).\n\nHigh Scores\n\n2.4 Billion is the default Grand Champion score.  My high so far (1 Buy-in)\nis @ 4.91 Billion for which I received 2 Credits.  Previously I had set the\nGC with 2.8 Billion (no buy-ins) and received 3 Credits (possibly I could\nhave imagined this... but I don't think so)!  I also scored 2.7 Billion\nfor 3rd place and 1.8 Billion for 4th place (the high score list goes to 6)\nbut didn't get any credits. (Maybe only 1st and 2nd get credits?)\n\nQuotes\n\n??? Send me your favorite ???\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFirst, their is a diverter on the habitrail leading from the left ramp to\nthe left flipper which places the ball in the batwing.  This didn't work\nwhen BF first arrived, but now does.  The operator played with it, but\nI don't know what he did.  (It wasn't opening wide enough.)\n\nBugs\n\nThere is a ? loop or something champion displayed on the DMD occasionally\nbut this can't be seen in instant info - WHY!\n\nAlso, it would be nice to be able to see what Bat Gadgets have been\ncollected (or need to be collected) before getting the Super Laser Kick.\nThis could be done via instant info also.\n\nEaster Eggs\n\n6 player play is allowed (league type, just as in Baywatch).\n\nPressing both flipper buttons simultaneously will launch the ball (if it is\nin the plunger lane).\n\nNo cows so far :(\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Batman Forever", "possible_shots": "Left Orbit, Left Ramp, U-Turn Loop, Right Ramp, VUK, Middle Ramp, Right Orbit, Mini-ramp, VUK, Right Ramp, Right Orbit, Three Question Mark targets", "manufacturer": "Sega", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/batmanforever.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Batman Forever", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Tiesma\nand Jim Sweet\nVersion: 2.0\nDate:  April 2, 1997\n\n\nSend all comments, corrections and updates to tiesma@livingonline.com\n(should that email address not work please try tiesmasc@pilot.msu.edu).\n\nThis rulesheet should also be available from Bob McCann's web page at\nhttp://pilot.msu.edu/~mccannr1/ and Scott Piehler's web page at\nhttp://www.mindspring.com/~rosco29/pinball.htm\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n\nBig Bang Bar is most likely copyrighted and/or trademarked by Capcom Coin-Op.\nHowever, since Capcom Coin-Op has stopped making pinball machines they may\nhave sold the license to another company.  No official word has been given\nas to if this was done.\n\nThis sheet may be distributed and copied in any manner provided it is done\nso freely and credit is given to both the author and those listed in the\nSpecial Thanks section.\n\nNote: lots of information for this version was taken directly from\nthe BBB manual (courtesy of Jim Sweet).\n\n\nComments:\n\nPersonally, I found Big Bang Bar to be a delight to play.  But, even\nbefore I played it I was amazed upon seeing it.  It is gorgeous!  Lots of\ndark coloring combined with a black light and the appropriate blues, yellows,\nand greens (that glow under a black light) made this very pleasing to the\neyes.  On top of the coloring, the dancing go-go girl is quite a sight to\nbehold - and very realistic for such a simple device.\n\nThis was, IMHO, the best Capcom Pinball!  In fact, it might have given\nBally/Williams and Sega some good competition if it ever got produced and\nhad the type of distribution it deserved.\n\nAnd, this author is a very proud owner of a Big Bang Bar translight\nsigned by Rob Morrison, the designer, and Stan Fukuoka, the artist.\n\n\nSpecial Note:\n\nUnfortunately, Capcom Coin-Op closed their Pinball division before this\ngame could be produced.  As of this writing of the rulesheet only 10 Big\nBang Bar's are known to exist.  Of these 10 only 1 is owned by someone\noutside of the company (it is currently in the San Fransisco Bay Area).\nIn Capcom's closing statement they said that they would still be pursuing\nasset transfers with Sega Pinball.  As a result, this game could still be\nproduced, but it may not.  This is very sad as this game was truly\nexcellent in my humble opinion.\n\nOf the 9 left in the possession of Capcom, the design team has first\nchance at buying them.  I am unaware at this time of whether this has been\ndone (but believe it has).\n\n\nContents:\n\nDisclaimer\nComments\nSpecial Note\nContents\nAbbreviations\nSpecial Thanks\nCredits\nNew to this Version\nPlayfield Layout\nRules\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Skill Shot\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Modes (Bar Room Brawl)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mash A Go-Go\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cosmic Dartz\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Babescanner\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lunapalooza\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tour the Bar\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Happy Hour\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chase the Waitress\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Extra Ball\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Get Lucky\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Features\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Looped in Space\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Multi-Brawl\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ray's Ball Busters\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tube Dancer\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Underground\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wizard Award\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Big Bang\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bonus\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Extra Balls\nQuotes\nBugs and Potential Problems\nEaster Eggs\n\n\nAbbreviations:\n\nIMHO - In my Humble/Honest Opinion\nK - Thousand\nM - Million\nSDTM - Straight Down The Middle\nToM - Theatre of Magic\n\n\nSpecial Thanks:\n\nBill Ung - ung@filenet.com\n\"Dangerous Dann\" Frank - dangerd@primenet.com\nJoshua Lehan - krellan@netgate.net\nJim Sweet - jimsweet@imscyber.com\nSteve King\n\n\nCredits:\n\nBig Bang Bar Design Team:\n\nRob Morrison, Designer\nSteven King, Software Engineer\nStan Kukuoka, Art\nPaul Mazur, Art Production\nHugh Vanzanten, Art Production\nMike Miller, Mechanical Engineer\nJeff Powell, Music and Sound FX\nKevin Loza, Dot Matrix Animator\nJohn Boyston, Electrical Engineer\n\nSupporting Roles:\nSoftware: Bill Pfutzenreuter, Tony DeFeo, Samuel Zehr\nMechanical: Kathy Adams, Nick Biancalana, Chuck Johnson, Dan Molter, Horace\nRodriguez, Grace Sierakowski, Mike Zhang\nMusic & Sound: Chris Granner\nDots: Scott Pikulski\nElectrical: Mark Coldebella\nLab: Steve Ritschdorf, Dave Rose, Tim Stone, Bill Ziegler\nModel Shop: Joe Cherne, Steve Cordebella, Bill Kinahan, Jim Kleinschmidt, Mike\nWheeler\nProduction: Keith Janus  \nMarketing and Sales: Ron Malinowski, Rita Rokos, Alison Stroll, Elizabeth Stroll, Matt\nWillenbrink\nPurchasing: Karen Dalley\nSpeech: Anita Eisenstein, Dave Jones, Mary Kinahan, Jeff Powell, Frank Panzek,\nGrace Sierakowski, Denise Wallner, Darryl Williams\nEngineering Services: Ray Kancius, Mark Ashburn, Steve Wysocki\nField Techs: Kenton Frimel, Lance Weiske\nSpecial Thanks to: Python Anghelo, Mark Ritchie, Mike \"MEK\" Kutella, and the entire\nCapcom Team. \n\n\nNew to this Version:\n\nA _total_ revamp... there is new information in every section!\n\n\nPlayfield Layout:\n\nStarting at the bottom and working around clockwise...\n\nTwo Flippers - Standard position, standard shape.  They are black with\ngreen lettering.  The left one says BIG - the right one says BANG.\n[Note: Third flipper (later) says BAR.]\n\nTwo Slingshots - Normal size, shape, and position. Scores 110 per kick.\n\nBall Lock - Above the left slingshot is the ball return habit trail.  At\nthe end of this trail is a metal post which can be raised and lowered.\nIf lowered, the ball falls into the left inlane without triggering the\ninlane switch. If not, it locks one, two, or three balls.  This is used\nduring for the Multi-brawl ball lock.\n\nLeft Inlane - Standard.  When lit, it executes \"Qualify mode\" which\nmeans that the next ramp shot will actually start a mode.  The flippers\ntoggle the \"Qualify Mode\" light between the left and right inlanes.\nScores 100K, plus 5K bonus.\n\nLeft Outlane - Standard.  Scores 1,750.\n\nKick Back - At the bottom of the left outlane.  Lit by a shot to the\nCosmic Darts saucer.  Scores 110 and 50,250 bonus when lit.\n\nLeft Drop Targets (a.k.a. 4-Bank) - Bank of four drop targets directly\nabove the left slingshot.  Hitting all four targets enables the left\nalien ball lock for \"Looped in Space\" multiball.  These are also used\nduring the \"Looped in Space\" multiball feature. Scores 15K per target\ndropped and an additional 50K for completing entire bank.\n\nNeon Green Return Tube - not really part of the playfield, but rather\none of the return options for the ramp.  This is used during the Tube\nDance, and it deposits the ball in the habitrail over the left\nslingshot. (one of two possible sources for this habitrail).\n\nLeft Orbit - Loops around to the bumpers (when no mode is qualified or\nduring Mash A Go-Go mode) or exits the right orbit (during all modes\nexcept Mash A Go-Go).  This is used during Babescanner, Mash A Go-Go,\nChase the Waitress, and Tour the Bar modes.  Scores 100K plus 5K bonus.\n\nSpinner - Contained in the Left Orbit loop.  Scores 110 per revolution\n(typically >20K per solid hit).\n\nGreen Standups - Three of them.  One on each side of the entrance to\nthe  ramp and a third actually on the side of the near the entrance to\nthe Upper Orbit.  Hitting all three targets lights the Tube Dancer.\nFront standup scores 10K, side scores 12,750.\n\nRamp - the only ramp.  It is situated just to the right of the left\norbit approximately 1/2 of the way up the playfield.  There is series of\ndiverters that steer ramp shots to any of five different destinations.\nIf a mode is qualified, this shot starts the mode.  If the Tube Lady is\ndancing, this is the jackpot shot.  The ramp also leads to the \"Looped\nin Space\" and Multi-brawl locks (if they are lit).  If none of the above\napply, the ramp shot counts as a trip to the Bathroom. (more info on the\nramp later).\n\nInner Orbit - a small orbit which goes under the ramp and curves back\naround to the pop bumpers.  The placement of this loop is similar to\nthat upper inside loop on Getaway.  A solid shot will actually go past\nthe bumpers and hit the Doorman drop target.\n\nCenter Drop Targets (a.k.a. 3-Bank) - There are three of them directly\nup the center of  the playfield and to the upper right of the ramp.  The\nprimary purpose of these targets is to \"Qualify Mode\" (so the next ramp\nshot will actually start the mode).  Hitting all three lights the right\nalien ball lock for \"Looped in Space\" Multiball.  There are standup\ntargets behind these drop targets.  Scores 15K for each drop target and\nand additional 50K for completing the bank.  Standup targets behind drop\ntargets score 10K.\n\nPop-Bumpers - Three of them above the Center Drop Targets.  These are\nused in the Mash A Go-Go mode.  Each hit scores 7,500.  If no mode is\nqualified or active, each hit changes the flashing (i.e. next) mode.\n\nTube Lady - A neon green dancer in a tube.  This is a visual toy that\nactually dances during the Tube Dance feature.  Very COOL!!!\n\nB-A-R Lanes - Standard rollover lanes above the pop-bumpers.  These are\nused to advance multiplier and for the standard skill shot.  During the\nskill shot, the flipper buttons steer the flashing (desired) light\nbetween the letters.  During normal play, the desired shot is any unlit\nlane.  Again, the flippers steer the lights.  Unlit lanes score 100K\ntimes the current bonus multiplier, and also 10K bonus.  Lit lanes score\n50K and 2,500 bonus.  Lighting all three lanes scores 500K and advances\nthe multiplier up to 5x.  After that, completing all three lanes adds\n250K bonus.\n\nDoorman drop target (a.k.a. 1-Bank) - a single drop target below the\nB-A-R lanes and to the right of the bumpers.  A solid hit through the\nInner Orbit will hit this target.  Behind the target is a passage that\nexits out onto the Right Orbit.  It is also possible to hit this target\ndirectly from the left flipper, but it's a very hard shot.  The 1-Bank\nis used during the Underground feature, and to collect extra ball when\nlit.  It also starts the Big Bang ultimate challenge mode when all other\nmodes and features have been completed.\n\n4-Ball Captive Ball Turnaround (a.k.a. Ray's Ball Busters) - 4 balls\nheld captive in an upside down U lane such that a hit of the captive\nball will propel the top most ball into the other lane.  It is possible\nto get all 4 balls on one side.  Hitting a ball from the flashing side\nwill add a letter for spelling B-R-A-W-L.  Complete B-R-A-W-L to lights\nthe lock for regular \"Multi-brawl\".  Unrelated to spelling B-R-A-W-L,\ntry to hit all the balls to the same side.  Scores 0 for hitting to the\nwrong side, 100K & 2500 bonus for hitting to the correct side, and 5M &\n75K bonus for hitting all balles to correct side.\n\n\"Loopy Martians\" - Sitting at the bar above the playfield in the upper\nright.  They act as ball locks for the Looped In Space mode.  There\nnames are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\nRight Orbit - Standard.  During all modes except Mash A Go-Go, the ball\ntravels all the way around and exits the left orbit.  Otherwise, the\ngates are down and the ball will go through the B-A-R lanes to the\nbumpers.\n\nUpper Right Flipper - located at the entrance to the right orbit.  It is\nblack with green lettering which says BAR.\n\nDarts Saucer - just behind the upper right flipper is located a saucer\nto hold the ball.  The ball may enter this saucer from one of two\ndirections - straight in or off the back side of the upper right\nflipper.  This is primarily used during Cosmic Dartz mode.  At other\ntimes, it lights the left kickback and scores 500K & 20K bonus.\n\nPlunger Lane - plunges the ball into the right orbit and ends up above\nthe B-A-R lanes for the standard skill shot.\n\nRight Outlane - Standard.  Awards Special when lit by repeated Bathroom\ntrips.  Scores 1750.\n\nRight Inlane - Standard.  Can be lit to qualify modes, just like the\nLeft Inlane.  Scores 100K plus 2,500 bonus.\n\nHere are further details about the ramp shot and it's associated\nconsequences.  Shots up the ramp have five different potential\ndestinations depending on the circumstances:\n\nIf the Tube Lady is dancing, the ball turns left at the top of the\nramp and rolls down through the Neon Green Tube to the habitrail over\nthe left slingshot.\nElse if the left \"Looped in Space\" alien lock is lit (by hitting all\nfour targets in the left drop target bank), the ball travels over to the\nupstairs bar.  Two aliens sit at the bar and the ball gets locked in the\nleft alien's mouth.  The upstairs bar is at the back, right corner of\nthe game up by the glass.\nElse if the right \"Looped in Space\" alien lock is lit (by hitting\nall three targets in the center drop target bank), the ball goes to the\nbar and gets locked in the right alien's mouth.\nElse if the Multi-brawl locks are lit, the ball goes around past the\nbar, down the right side of the playfield (about 1/2 way) then crosses\nover to the habitrail over the left slingshot.  Sometimes the ball takes\nthis route even when Multi-brawl lock is not lit.  In this case, the\nball drops into the left inlane\nElse, the ramp shot counts as a trip to the Bathroom and the ball\ntravels to a habitrail over the right slingshot and drops into the right\ninlane.\n\nA couple more notes about this complex ball diverting scheme:  At the\nstart of \"Looped in Space\" multi-ball, the aliens at the bar turn around\nand spit the balls onto this same habitrail setup.  The two balls roll\ndown to the last diverter where one heads for the left slingshot\nhabitrail and the other heads for the right slingshot habitrail.  This\nlast diverter is actually just a coil that can give the ball a magnetic\npull as it goes by.  The first two diverters are metal arms, and the\ndiverter that selects between the two alien mouths is a retracting post\nlike the one behind the trunk on ToM.  The ramp is long and steep, but\nthe powerful flippers have no problem making the shot.  You can even\nbackhand the shot from the left flipper.  Occasionally, a ball that\ndoesn't make it up the ramp may drain SDTM.  There is a ball saver that\ndetects this and returns the ball, but the default setting for this\nadjustment disables this ball saver.  The ramp shot itself has no\ninherent score, but all of the various feature functions have their own\nscoring as described later.\n\n\nRules:\n\nThere are 9 Modes and 5 mode-less Features.  Modes must be qualified and\nattempted.  The modes desired shots do not need to be made for the mode\nto count as \"finished\".  The mode-less Features are available any time\nand the objectives must actually be completed for the Feature to be\ncounted as \"finished\".  Features can be completed multiple times, if\ndesired, while Modes can only be played once.  The object of the game is\nto finish all Modes and Features.  This will light the 1-Bank for to\nstart the ultimate challenge: Big Bang.  The star bumpers rotate the\ncurrent flashing (i.e. next) mode when no mode is qualified or active.\n\nThe flashing Mode is qualified by the 3-Bank and the standups behind\nit.  Mode is temporarily qualified by a lit inlane.  Only one inlane is\nlit.  The flippers change which lane is lit.  This allows the player to\nchange decide whether to qualify a mode or not.  There are two reasons\nnot to qualify a mode.  First, qualifying the mode locks in the flashing\nmode as the next mode to be played.  If you want to play a different\nmode, return to the bumpers to make a different flashing mode.  Since\nbumper hits rotate the flashing mode lights, it is a semi-random\nselection process.  The second reason not to qualify a mode, is to earn\nBathroom awards.  When no mode is active or qualified, the ramp shot\ncounts as a trip to the Bathroom and then returns the ball to the right\ninlane for another ramp shot.  Bathroom awards are worth collecting.\n\nOnce a mode is qualified, it is started by a ramp shot.  All modes,\nexcept Get Lucky, are timed and require additional shots to complete.\nThe default mode time is 30 seconds.  Get Lucky instantly gives you a\nrandom award.\n\n\nSkill Shot:\n\nThe object is to plunge the ball through the lit B-A-R lane.  The first\nsuccessful skill shot scores 2M.  An additional 1M is scored by hitting\nthe flashing lane without using the flipper buttons to rotate the flashing\nlane.  The score value goes up by 1M for every successful skill shot.\nMissing the skill shot scores 100K.\n\nA soft plunge will not make it all the way up to the B-A-R lanes and will\nroll down to the upper right flipper.  At this point, a shot through the\nInner Orbit to the 1-bank counts as a Secret Skill Shot for 6M.\n\n\nModes (Bar Room Brawl):\n\nCompleting all modes lights Bar Room Brawl as having been completed.  This\nis one of the steps in progressing towards the wizard mode.\n\nMash A Go-Go.  Get the ball into the bumpers using any of the orbit\nshots.  It is also possible to hit the ball directly into the bumber\narea with a left-flipper shot between the 3-Bank and the captive balls.\nThis is a hard shot, though, so it's better just to shoot for an orbit.\nEach bumper hit scores a value.  The value starts at 100K and increases\nby 100K on every 3rd hit (up to a max of 800K per hit).  This works out\nto almost 40M for 50 hits.\n\nCosmic Dartz (sic).  Shoot the saucer by the upper right flipper.\nScores 1.5M & 500K bonus, 500K each additional hit.  Note, the eject\nsends the ball back to the left flipper for another shot at the saucer.\n\nBabescanner.  Shoot left or right outer orbits.  The shot is registered\nat the spinner in the left orbit.  Scores 1M & 250K bonus for each loop.\n\nLunapalooza.  Shoot right orbit.  Scores 2M & 250K bonus.\n\nTour the Bar.  The following five shots are lit: right orbit, left\norbit, eject saucer, inner orbit, and ramp.  Shots do not have to be\ncompleted in order.  Scores 1.5M & 100K bonus.\n\nHappy Hour.  The following targets/switches are lit: 3-Bank, 4-Bank,\n1-Bank, bumpers, eject hole, green standups, and the standups behind the\n3-Bank drop targets.  Each target is worth 500K & 5K bonus.\n\nChase the Waitress.  Five shots must be made in order.  Only one is lit\nat a time.  The shots are: eject saucer, right orbit, inner orbit, ramp,\nleft orbit.  Score starts at 20M & 50K bonus and decreases as time runs\ndown. Chase the Waitress will end when all the shots are made even if\nthe timer has not run out.\n\nExtra Ball.  This Mode lights extra ball at the 1-Bank.  While the\nintended shot is the inner orbit, this is not required.  The target can\nbe hit as the ball is bouncing around in the bumpers.  The mode ends\nwhen the timer runs out or when the extra ball is collected.\n\nGet Lucky.  This Mode is not timed.  It simply gives you an\ninstantaneous random award.  The possible awards are: 8M, collect bonus,\nhold bonus, bonus x at 10x, bumpers 5x for rest of ball, spinner 5x for\nrest of ball, kickback lit for rest of ball, restart ball saver for its\nnormal time.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nLooped in Space.  Knock down entire 4-bank to light left alien lock.\nKnock down entire 3-bank to light right alien lock.  Knocking down the\nbanks of drop targets repeatedly increases the Looped in Space jackpot\nvalue.  When alien locks are lit, shoot the ramp to lock balls.  When\nboth balls are locked, Looped in Space 2-ball multi-ball starts.  Knock\ndown both the 4-bank and the 3-bank targets to collect the jackbot.\n\nMulti-brawl.  Hit captive balls to spell B-R-A-W-L.  This will light the\nbrawl lock.  Shoot ramp to lock balls.  When three balls are locked,\n3-ball multi-brawl starts.  Shoot the ramp to collect jackpots.  Double\nand triple jackpots can be collected by shooting balls up the ramp in\nrapid succession.  The inner orbit scores double jackpot.\n\nRay's Ball Busters.  Hit all captive balls to the proper side (as\nindicated by flashing lights) to collect instant \"drink\" awards.\n\nTube Dancer.  Hit all three green standups near the ramp entrance to\nlight the ramp shot for the Tube Dance.  Ramp shots collect jackpot for\na limited time.  Scores 10M.  Extra ball (at the 1-Bank) can also be lit\nfor a limited time.\n\nUnderground.  Hit the 1-Bank multiple times to start Underground for 10\nseconds.  Shoot the inner orbit.  Timer is reset to 10 seconds every\ntime an inner orbit is made.  Scoring starts at 1M & 10K bonus per orbit\nand increases by 1M & 250K bonus for each inner orbit made.\n\n\nWizard Award:\n\nThe Big Bang. Finish all modes and features to light Big Bang at 1-Bank.\nHit 1-Bank to start.  A timed 4-ball multi-ball is started.  Drained balls\nare returned to the plunger lane.  Note, you must manually plunge the balls\nback into play.  This is important because scoring is a function of the\nnumber of balls in play.  All targets are worth 543,210 times the number\nof balls in play.  Jackpots can be earned three ways: ramp shot,\ncompleting either bank of drop targets, or shooting the inner orbit.\nJackpots are worth 5M times the number of balls in play.\n\n\nBonus:\n\nThe bonus multiplier is increased by completing the B-A-R lanes.  It\nincreases to 2x, then ???.  The current bonus multiplier is displayed\non the playfield directly above the flippers (if I recall correctly).\n\nThe bonus is calculated from the following equation: \n\n???\n\n\n\nExtra Balls:\n\nExtra balls can be obtained by:\n\nAdvancing the bonus to ??? times\nThe Lite Extra Ball mode\nDuring The Big Bang (everything is lit relights Lite Extra Ball mode)\n???\n\n\n\nQuotes:\n\nI've heard there is an adult mode and a family mode for this game.\nFurthermore, if I've heard correctly, the following quotes are from the\nadult mode.  If not, they are in the regular mode (b/c I definitely\nheard them).  Note: All are stated with a very sexy female voice and\nsome really  cool background music.\n\nA little more to the left.\nA little more to the right.\nHarder. [upon hitting the ball such that it goes 1/2 way up the ramp\nand comes back down]\n\nOther quotes also exist... in general they tend to be comical or sexy or\nboth.\n\n\n\nBugs and Potential Problems:\n\nWhile playing one of the games and getting the ball to travel to the\nball lock (above the left slingshot) the post that drops to allow the\nball to fall into the inlane would occasionally pop back up too soon\nthus shooting the ball over the inlane and unfortunately into the into\nthe outlane (most of the time).  The attendant was able to fix this,\nbut it is something to watch out for.\n\nSometimes both Looped in Space locked balls end up in the same alien's\nmouth.  If the switches are adjusted properly, the game detects this\nproperly and Looped in Space is started immediately.  Otherwise, you\nhave to wait until the third ball search.  At this time, the game\nfigures out what happened and everything proceeds normally.\n\nThe ball can easily get stuck at the exit from the inner orbit.  The\nball search can not clear this and you have to nudge the game to get the\nball back.\n\n\nEaster Eggs:\n\nDuring the match animation (if it is turned on) an alien will 'barf up'\nthe number.\n\nDuring attract mode, hitting Start (S) Left (L) Right (R) in the\nfollowing sequences will display secret messages. SLRSLR, SLRSLLR,\nSLRSLLLR, SLRSLLLLR, SLRSLLLLLR.\n\nSome random attract mode screens:  Very funny...\n\n\"Martians don't let Martians drink and fly!\"\n\n\"On the night of July 2nd, 1947 a loud crash was heard near Roswell,\nNew Mexico.  Remains of an alien spacecraft were recovered, although\nthis was officially denied by the United States Government.  Was this\ncraft the advance scout of an impending alien invasion of the Earth?\nOr was it simply an accident by a group of joyriders after having\none too many at the...

However, I 'saved the Queen'\nmany times back when it was new.  Questions, comments and additions can be\nforwarded to me, Mike Kahler.\n\nImportant Things\n\n\n Flippers  Four total, all standard size.  Two lower, in normal decor.\nTwo upper, in same orientation as lower flippers, but over halfway up the\nplayfield and much farther apart.\n\n Slingshots  The usual two above the lower flippers.\n\n Plunger  Standard spring loaded manual plunger.  Delivers ball to raised\nplastic field for Skill Shot.\n\n Left/Right Inlane  Lights Center Target, EB when lit.\n\n Left Outlane  Standard Kickback, Special (?) when lit.\n\n Right Outlane  Gate can be opened to Right Inlane.  Gate will close\nimmediately after first use.  Special (?) when lit.\n\n Center Target  Single green target at top center of playfield.\n\n Left Cannon Load  Saucer located at end of path between Left Guards.\nPasses ball onto Left Cannon.\n\n Right Cannon Load  Saucer located at end of path between Right Guards.\nPasses ball onto Right Cannon.  Successful Skill Shot lands in this\nsaucer, missed Skill Shot falls just below the saucer.\n\n Center Cannon  Short path just left of Center Target.  Launches King's\nChamber mini-ball.  Ball returns to Left Cannon.\n\n Left Cannon  Kicker loaded by Left Cannon Load or Center Cannon.  When\nfired, shoots ball up and across playfield, to Right Habitrail.\n\n Right Cannon  Kicker loaded by Right Cannon Load.  When fired, shoots\nball up and across playfield, to Left Habitrail.\n\n Left Habitrail  Funnel-shaped end faces Right Cannon, returns to Left\nInlane.\n\n Right Habitrail  Funnel-shaped end faces Left Cannon, returns to Right\nInlane.\n\n Left/Right Troll Targets  Single Target Located behind Left/Right Drop\nTargets.\n\n Left/Right Bonus Loops  U-turns passing behind Left/Right Troll Targets.\nFeeds ball directly to either Upper Flipper.\n\n Left/Right Drop Targets  3 bank targets, blocking Left/Right Troll\nTargets.  Value arrows in front of each target.\n\n King's Chamber  A small, pachinko type setup in the backglass, consisting\nof several rows of pins and 5 'slots' across the bottom.  Mini-ball is\nautomatically fired.\n\n Left Guards  5 targets, 2 between the Left Outlane and Left Cannon Load\npath, 3 between Left Cannon Load path and opening to upper playfield area.\nEach target has a corresponding (green?) light.  The 3 bank of Guards\nmakes up the barrier below the Left Upper Flipper.\n\n Right Guards  5 targets, 2 between the Right Outlane and Right Cannon\nLoad path, 3 between Right Cannon Load path and opening to upper playfield\narea.  Each target has a corresponding (red?) light.  The 3 back of Guards\nmakes up the barrier below the Right Upper Flipper.\n\n Center Post  Pop-up post between Lower Flippers.  Large orange\ntranslucent plastic.\n\n\nPlayfield General\n\nSingle level main playfield is almost completely symmetrical from Left to\nRight, with exception of Kickback on Left and Gate on Right Outlanes.\nSkill Shot and return from Center Cannon also differ from side to side,\nbut they are on a raised level, so the actual playfield is very symmetric.\n\nBesides being divided Left and Right, the playfield also has distinctive\nUpper and Lower areas.  The Lower area is comprised of the Lower flippers,\nSlingshots, and Left/Right Guard Targets and Cannon Loads.  The only\npassage to the Upper Area is dead cent er between the Left and Right Guard\nTargets.  The Upper Area is about 1/3 the length of the full table.  Each\nLeft/Right Drop Target Bank, Troll Target and Bonus Loop is located\nopposite the opposite side's upper flipper.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nThe Skill Shot is hit or miss only.  The plunger feeds to the right\nentrance of a raised, horseshoe shaped path.  At the center of the top of\nthe horseshoe is the path you are shooting for.  Hitting this path will\naward the Tower Bonus, starting at 100K a nd increasing 100K for each\nsuccessive hit on the same ball (IE, Extra Balls and plunger fed balls for\nMulti-Ball keep the award increasing.  Advancing to ball 2 or ball 3\nresets the award to 100K.) In addition to the Tower Bonus, the Right\nCannon Load saucer is scored on a successful Skill shot.  Overshooting\nthe Skill Shot will place the ball coming downward toward the lower\nflippers in the Right Cannon Load path.  Undershooting will return the\nball to the plunger.  The Tower Bonus maxes at 900K (or was it 1M ?).\n\nModes\n\nModes? This is a 1987 game- who ever heard of modes!?\n\nGeneral Rules\n\nDrop targets/Troll targets\n\nEach Left/Right set of drop targets has lights in front of each\ntarget, 150K, 200K and 250K, from top to bottom.  These lamps cycle\n150, 150+200, 200, 200+250, 250, 250+150 continuously (values are\nfrom memory, but the idea is correct, the lamps cycle a single lamp,\nthen two adjacent, then the next single, etc.).  Hitting any drop\ntarget when it's lamp is lit will set up the Troll target for that\nvalue(s), and a timer will begin. The lit value(s) will begin\n'pulsing' faster and faster, and the drop targets reset if the Troll\nis not hit before the timer expires.  The Drops also reset if the\nTroll is hit. Hitting 3 Trolls during the course of the game lights\none of the inlanes for Extra Ball, which can then be alternated via\nLane-Change(tm).  The number of trolls is probably, if not\nautomatically, adjusted.\n\nBonus Loops\n\nPassing behind one of the Drop/Troll target sets will begin a timer\nand light that loop for Bonus X.  The timer expires as do the Trolls,\npulsing faster and faster, then unlit.  Bonus X's are displayed up\nthe center of the playfield, from 2X to 9X.  One X value is flashing\nto begin with- reaching this X will light an Outlane Special for the\nremainder of that ball.  The flashing X for Special is settable or\nautomatically adjusted. Scoring 9X and 99K EOB Bonus awards a\ndifferent musical salute at the end of the ball.\n\nNote it is possible to rack up Bonus X's continuously in a figure-8\narrangement.  After hitting, say the Left Loop, the ball is fed to the\nleft upper flipper.  Easy shot to the Right Loop, which feeds to the right\nupper flipper.  Now hit the Left loop, then right, and so on.  Fairly\nquick action due to the short playfield area up there :).\n\nCenter Target\n\nEither Inlane will light the Center Target for Raise Post.  Here again the\ncenter target light is on a timer and expires as does everything else.\nHitting the Center Target when lit will raise the Center Post for a\npre-determined amount of time (about 10 seconds).\n\nGuards\n\nThe current value of the Guards is displayed on 5 lights just above the\nlower flippers.  Values are 100K, 150K, 200K, 250K, and Special.  The game\nstarts with 100K lit, and all 10 guards lit.  Hitting (un-lighting) all 10\nguards will award the Guard Value , advance to the next value, and light\nthe Kickback and open the Gate if needed.  Guard value does not carry from\nball to ball (may be settable?).\n\nCannon Loads\n\nAt the entrance to each Cannon Load is a large red Load Cannon light.\nWhen lit, the Cannon Load will place the ball in the Cannon and serve a\nnew ball to the plunger.  If un-lit, the ball will be served to the\nCannon, then fired into the habitrail and back to the respective inlane.\nNote if a Cannon is already loaded, and that Load Cannon saucer is hit,\nthe cannon will first be fired into the habitrail, then the ball will be\nfed from the saucer to the Cannon, where it stays loaded. After loading\nboth Left and Right Cannon, the Center Cannon is lit for Load.  Placing\nthe remaining ball in the Center Cannon begins Multi-Ball(tm) (see below).\nAt the beginning of a new game, both Left and Right Cannons will be lit\nfor Load Cannon.  After the first Multi-Ball(tm), only the Left Cannon is\nlit for Load Cannon.  Only after the Left Cannon is loaded is the Right\nCannon lit for Load Cannon.  Note that as the game starts with the Right\nLoad Cannon lit, hitting the Skill Shot will automatically load the Right\nCannon and serve a new ball.\n\nMulti-Ball\n\nDuring Multi-Ball, all scores are doubled, with the exception of Queens\nRescue.  There is a 'traveling' Load Cannon light, moving from Left to\nCenter to Right Cannon, then starting over at the Left Cannon.  Placing\nany ball in the lit cannon will start INVINCIBLE/Queens' Rescue.  During\nINVINCIBLE, the Kickback, Gate and Center Post are un-expireable.\nINVINCIBLE lasts a set amount of time, usually about 15 seconds; the\ndisplays show the time remaining.  At the start of INVINCIBLE, the 6\ncenter (3 green and 3 red) guards are lit.  Hitting all 6 of these Guards\nscores Queen's Rescue, ranging from 300K to 3M.  When scored, Queen's\nRescue resets to 300K, and increments gradually during every Multi-Ball\nsession.  It is possible to score multiple Queen's Rescues on a single\nMulti-Ball by reloading the lit Cannon after the Queen's Rescue animation\nis finished.\n\nKing's Chamber Shot\n\nEvery time a ball is loaded in the Center Cannon, the mini-ball is fired\nin the Kings Chamber (The Center Cannon holds the ball until the Kings\nChamber action is finished).  The mini-ball will fall downwards and into\none of the 5 slots across the bottom, lighting the shield above that slot.\nThe five shields can be steered either way with the flippers.  When the\nfifth shield is lit, the next Kings Chamber shot will light the Extra Ball\nat the Inlanes.  The next Kings Chamber shot will start over with no\nshields lit. Lit shields carry from ball to ball, at least until the first\nExtra Ball is scored off of them; they may carry indefinitely. After the\nlast ball of a game is drained, a free Kings Chamber shot is given to the\nplayer.  At this time, one shield is lit, but cannot be steered as above.\nIf when the mini-ball is fired, it lands in the lit slot, the player is\nawarded an extra ball.  Note in multi-player games, this free Kings\nChamber shot is given at the end of each player's game, not at the\ncomplete end of game as are the matches.\n\nTips, Tricks and Bad Things\n\nThe Skill shot is easy to master, and due to frequent Multi-Balls, maxing\nthe Tower Bonus is fairly easy. Multi-Ball is easy to achieve as one of\nthe two Cannons will always be lit for Load Cannon (Lock); no setup of the\nlocks is required.  The Left and Right Load Cannon saucers can\nconsistently be backhanded off the Left and Right Flippers, as well as\nbeing an open shot from the opposing Flippers.  The Center Cannon is the\nlongest shot possible from the lower flippers, but fairly forgiving and\npossible from either lower flipper.  Master the Load Cannon shots and\nyou'll be in eternal Multi-Ball! -That is if the game is in good\ncondition. As with many decomposing Williams games, the locks tend to be\nerratic.  On Big Guns, it always seems after loading a Cannon, not until\nyou have the next ball in play does the lock screw up and fire the locked\nball out (IE, if you wait with the new ball in the plunger, the lock will\nseem ok, but soon after plunging you find the locked ball not locked\nanymore).  I've seen failing locks on at least half of the BG's I've\nplayed.  It is possible to load a (failing) Cannon, get the next ball,\nLoad it in the opposite cannon, then get the next ball into the Center\nCannon, all before a lock screws up, but it makes it pretty difficult.\n\nAnother simple and common ailment of BG is to have burnt out Guard Lights.\nThis can make Queen's Rescue fairly difficult, as you have no idea what\nGuards are remaining to score the Queen's Rescue.  Constant battering of\nthe Guards can work, but when the seconds are counting away it gets more\ndifficult than it sounds.\n\nQuite often the Mini-ball wont launch when it's supposed to.  After the\nmachine tries twice (you can hear the kicker firing), it will\nautomatically award you one shield.  I recall it always being the leftmost\nshield, so it's to your best advantage to always steer the lit shields to\nthe right when you know the mini-ball isn't going to fire correctly.\n\nBG is a 7-digit display game, making the maximum score 9.9M + change.  Any\nplayer rolling the score over will be awarded the highest score on the\nhigh score board, marking it with 9,999,999.  Even if a previous player\nrolled the score 37 times and got high score of 9,999,999 the next player\nto roll it one time will again get the top high score.  Another oddity is\nthe machine gives replays _each_ time the replay score is passed, thus\nrolling it over and reaching the replay score again will award another\ncredit, over and over.  I recall suitable replay levels in the 3-5M range.\n\nAnd while on the subject, my best on BG is around 45M.  Extra Balls are\nsparse on this game, but Multi-Balls are a piece of cake, and you can get\nquite a score just off the Tower Bonus alone (after all, after one Queen's\nRescue, it's down in the 300K range, not comparable with 1M for a maxed\nTower Bonus, over and over while continuously locking balls).\n\n\"You are Invincible!

Lastly, thanks go to Jonathan\nDeitch and Brian Dominy whose Demolition Man rule sheet I shamelessly\ncopied as the basis for this rule sheets formatting!  :-)\nFrank Thomas' Big Hurt (BH) is a narrow body, 4-ball, baseball themed\ngame. Anything and everything that Gottlieb Premier might consider to be\ntheir legal property is, in fact, quite likely their legal property.\n\"Big Hurt\" is the property of \"Big Hurt Enterprises\".  \"Reebok\" is also\non there and they own that name.\nPlease email suggestions and errata to sjonke@jagunet.com.\n\nChanges\n\n\nCorrected multiball rounds (4th ball only in \"easy\" settings.)\nUpdated FSPA home page URL.\nSmall formatting changes.\nHTML-ized!\n\n\nPlayfield Description and Layout\n\nThis description begins at the center bottom and progresses roughly\nclockwise around the playfield.\nFlippers: There are two flippers at the bottom as usual and one upper\nleft flipper.  All are normal size Gottlieb flippers.  *All* of the\nflippers feature Gottlieb's Insta-Catch (tm).\nSlingshots: Two standard slingshots in the usual positions.\nLeft Inlane: Raises the home run ramp and starts the right loop flashing.\nThe inlane switch is *not* triggered if the ball is fed to the\nflipper via the left gap.\nLeft Outlane: Collects 3 Trading Cards.  There isn't any rubber on the\npost between the inlane and outlane.\nCard Standup: A thin, rectangular, white standup target just below the\nupper flipper.  It's half of \"Card Trade\".  Getting both Card and\nTrade lights the right scoop for Card Trade.\nCaptive Ball: A captive ball just above the upper left flipper.  Used for\ncombos.\nTrade Standup: A thin rectangular, white standup target just above the\nupper left flipper.  It's half of \"Card Trade\".  Getting both Card\nand Trade lights the right scoop for Card Trade.\nLeft Field Loop: Left side of the loop shot.  Initially worth 500k points.\nWhen shot the value increases and flashes for a short period of time.\nIf it is hit again the value increases and the timer resets.  The\nvalues are: 500k, 5M, 50M, 500M, ?.  The \"?\" scores ONE BILLION\npoints!\nLeft Scoop: This is a wide, inverted scoop just to the right of the left\nside of the loop.  It doesn't send the ball under the playfield, but\nup to a plastic/metal habitrail that feeds the ball to the upper\nleft flipper.\nCenter Ramp: A very wide metal ramp that sends the ball over the Warning\nTrack (WT).  A solid shot to the left side of the ramp goes into the\nLeft Gap.  A solid center shot goes into the home run hole.  A solid\nshot to the right side goes to the Right Gap.  A weak shot will fall\ninto the WT and head either back to the left flipper, or to the\npop bumpers.  The center portion of the ramp can raise allowing for\nshots at the Big Hurt sign, or the large rectangular targets to\neither side of the Big Hurt sign.\nGlove: This is a moving glove at the top of the Center Ramp.  It is\nsimilar to World Cup Soccer's goalie and will block shots going up\nthe ramp.  A solid hit on the glove counts as a \"catch\".  A weak\nhit counts as  a \"single\".\n     The design of the glove is pretty clever - when the center portion\nof the ramp is raised the glove actually catches the ball and drops\nit on the opposite side of the raised ramp.  Apparently on some\nmachines it then goes STDM, but this doesn't happen too often on\nthe BH I play, although it does head toward the tip of the\nflippers.  If it does head STDM there is a center post there to\nsave it if you can get yourself to lay off the flippers!  :-)\nWarning Track (WT): A trench which the ball must jump to make it to the\nleft gap, right gap, home run hole and other shots behind the ramp.\nIf the ball falls into the WT it either feeds to the left flipper\n(if the ball rolls left), or goes to the pop bumpers (if the ball\nrolls right.)\nLeft Gap: behind the left side of the center ramp and past the WT.  Feeds\nthe ball to the lower left flipper.  A shot to the Left Gap during\nsingle ball, non-mode play advances the \"inning\".  Innings raise the\nsuper jackpot by 100M and work toward the 7th Inning Stretch.\nAfter the 9th inning is completed, subsequent left gap shots score\n30M and then the right gap is lit for same, repeat.\nHome Run: a hole behind the center portion of the center ramp and past\nthe WT.  A shot to this scores a home run (HR) or a grand slam (GS)\nif the bases are loaded.  HRs score 10M.  GSs score 40M.\nRight Gap/Players Choice: behind the right side of the center ramp and\npast the WT.  Feeds the ball to Players Choice and then to the right\nflipper.  A shot to this when lit during single ball non-mode play\nstops the ball at Players Choice.\nBig Hurt Sign: This is a small sign above the home run hole that swivels\nback when the ball hits it, dropping the ball into the home run hole.\nThis can usually only be hit if the center portion of the ramp is\nraised.\nLeft Sign: This is a large rectangular target to the left side of the Big\nHurt Sign.  A shot to this target adds a letter to \"GRAND SLAM\".\nThis usually can only be hit when the center portion of the ramp is\nraised.\nRight Sign: Similar to the Left Sign, but to the right of the Big Hurt\nSign.\nLoad Bases: this is a lane at the top right portion of the playfield,\njust above the pop bumpers and below the top of the loop.  A ball\nthat rolls through this lane loads the bases.\nBig Hurt Pothole: this is a pothole in a lane next to the Load Bases lane.\nIf the ball falls into this pothole a letter is added to \"BIG HURT\".\nSpell BIG HURT to collect double jackpot.  The pothole kicks the ball\ndown to the pop bumpers.\nPop Bumpers: Two of them just below the Load Bases lane and Big Hurt\nPothole. Hits on these change the random award value.  Pressing and\nholding both flippers stops the pop bumpers.  Hits on the pop bumper\nswitches change the random award value even if the flippers are\nheld.  Balls exit from the pop bumpers by dropping into the Bullpen\nhole.\nBullpen hole: A hole just below the pop bumpers.  Feeds to right flipper.\nWhen the ball rolls in here *after* pop bumper switch closures, the\ncurrent bullpen award is given.  The ball is then fed to the right\nflipper.  If the ball does *not* touch a pop bumper before entering\nthis hole, then the ball will roll to the right scoop without giving\na bullpen award, but will give whatever the right scoop is lit for.\nDrop Targets: A bank of three to the right of and below the center ramp.\nThey can be independently knocked down by the game.  Complete the\ndrop targets to raise the center portion of the center ramp and\nadd a base runner.  Also used for the skill shot, combos and\nstolen bases.  If nothing special is going on they score 30K each.\nRight Field Loop: right side of the loop shot.  Initially lit solid.\nAfter shooting, going through the left inlane or getting a home\nrun it flashes and if shot increases jackpot by 10M.  If \"Big Hurt\nShot\" is lit, a diverter will stop the ball at the top of the\nloop, sending it toward the Big Hurt pothole and the load bases\nrollover.\nRight Hole: Just below the right loop and above the right inlane/outlane.\nCan be lit for Start Round and/or Card Trade.  Feeds the ball to\nthe right flipper.\nRight Outlane: In the normal place.  There isn't any rubber on the post\nbetween the inlane and outlane.\nRight Inlane: Raises the center portion of the center ramp for a period of\ntime and lights the captive ball and left scoop for \"combo\".  The\ninlane switch is *not* triggered if the ball is fed to the\ninlane via the right gap/players choice, bullpen or right hole.\nCenter Post: In the usual position for a center post.\nOn the playfield just above the flippers are lights in a diamond pattern,\nrepresenting first base, second base, third base and home plate (home\nplate is the \"shoot again\" light).  These lights show how many runners you\nhave on base and where they are.  Advance runners by getting singles,\nwalks, stolen bases and home runs/grand slams.  Runs scored are counted\nand are a small part of the end of game bonus.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nAfter plunging, the ball is fed to the upper left flipper.  Shooting the\nraised drop target awards a home run/grand slam and 10M/40M points\nrespectively.  The ball goes straight toward the upper flipper like a\nbaseball being pitched to the batter, but if you hold the flipper up the\nball will bounce up toward the captive ball and back down to the flipper\nfor a relatively easy shot at the raised drop target.\n\nRounds (Modes)\n\nRounds are started from the right hole when lit.  After finishing a mode,\nget a \"catch\" to relight Start Round.  The modes are:\nGolden Glove - 2 balls are launched into play.  Shoot glove for catch +\n20M.  Unlike normal play, any hit on the glove, weak or strong,\ncounts as  a catch.  Catch awards are also given during this mode,\nso you can really rack up some points and work toward the Catches\nChamp.  After the first successful catch a 3rd  ball is launched\ninto play.\nFrank's HR Derby - 2 balls are launched into play.  Shoot the home run\nhole for home run/grand slam + points (10M for HR, 40M for GS).\nAfter the first home run a 3rd is plunged into play.\nSteal Home - Timed mode.  Player is on 1st base.  Shoot left scoop, then\ncenter drop target to steal a base.  Steals score 20M, 30M then Extra\nBall + 40M.  Steals also collect a card.  5 seconds are added to the\ntimer when the left scoop is shot.  The mode ends after home plate\nis stolen or the timer runs out.\n#35 All Stars - Timed mode.  Any shot up the ramp that gets by the glove,\nor any shot to the right scoop, adds a player to the All Star\nlineup, collects 10M+10M and adds 2 seconds to the timer.  The\nmode ends when the timer runs out, or after 9 players are added\nto the lineup.  Completing the mode scores a total of 450M.\nFrank Thomas Cards - 2 balls are launched into play.  Left and right\norbits are lit for 10M + Trading Card.  After the first successful\nshot a 3rd is launched into play.\nNight Game - 2 balls are launched into play.  2 major shots are lit (left\nloop, left gap, home run, right gap or right loop.  Lit shots move\naround.  Shoot one of the lit shots to complete an inning.  All\nof these shots also score 3M whether or not they are lit.  After\nthe first successful shot a 3rd ball is launched into play.\n\nWorld Series\n\nAfter completing all normal modes, World Series is lit.  Light the right\nscoop and shoot it to start this mode.  World Series is a timed 1-ball\nwizard mode.  Shoot left loop, left gap, right gap and right loop for 30M\neach.  After completing those shots, home run is lit for super jackpot.\n\nMultiball\n\nMany of the rounds in BH are multiball rounds.  In addition you can\nchoose \"regular\" multiball from the Players Choice (right gap) when lit,\nor get it as a bullpen award.  The sequence of shots in this multiball\nis: home run (scores jackpot), orbit, homerun within 5 seconds (scores\ndouble jackpot), orbit, homerun within 5 seconds (scores super jackpot).\nThe sequence can be repeated for more jackpots, double jackpots and\nsuper jackpots.\nIf you don't hit the homerun before time runs out, shoot an orbit again\nto restart the timer and raise the ramp.  After the 1st and 2nd HR's a\n3rd and then 4th ball are plunged into play.\n\nJackpot & Super Jackpot\n\nRegular jackpot can be scored during 7th Inning Stretch, during regular\nmultiball, by spelling BIG HURT (double jackpot) and from a bullpen\naward or card trade.  The base value is 20M.  Advance jackpot by 10M\nduring single-ball, non-mode play by shooting the right orbit when it\nis flashing.  The right orbit flashes after shooting it, after a HR,\nafter the ball rolls left out of the warning track or when the ball rolls\nover the left inlane switch.  Also, during 7th Inning Stretch or regular\nmultiball (when any jackpot is lit) shoot the left loop to advance\njackpot by 10M.  The jackpot value carries over between balls.\nSuper jackpot can be scored during regular Multiball, World Series\nand as a Card Trade.  The value of the super jackpot is 100M x innings\ncompleted for a maximum of 900M.  Complete innings by shooting the\nleft gap during single-ball, non-mode play or during the Night Game\nmode.\n\nInnings & 7th Inning Stretch\n\nComplete innings by shooting the left gap during non-mode single ball\nplay, or via the Night Game mode.  After finishing the 6th inning, 7th\nInning Stretch begins.  7th Inning Stretch is a 4-ball multiball.  Shoot\nleft loop to advance jackpot by 10M.  Shoot right orbit or center ramp\npast the glove to add a letter to BIG HURT.  Spell BIG HURT to collect\ndouble jackpot.\nAfter finishing 7th Inning Stretch, completing the 9th inning lights\nthe left gap for 30M.  After shooting the left gap the right gap lights\nfor 30M.  Repeat.\nThe value of the super jackpot is based on innings completed: 100M x\ncompleted innings, for a maximum of 900M.\n\nGrand Slam Derby\n\nSpell GRAND SLAM via the left and right signs or bullpen awards.  After\nspelling GRAND SLAM, Grand Slam Derby begins.  This is the similar to the\nFrank's HR Derby mode, except that each home run shot counts as a Grand\nSlam and collects 40M, and it is a 4-ball multiball - all 4 balls are\nplunged into play at the beginning of the round.\n\nCatches & Glove Awards\n\nA solid hit on the glove counts as a catch and collects 1M.  A weak hit\non the glove counts as a single and collects 100K.  A \"catch\" relights\nthe right hole for Start Round if it is not already lit.  Catches are\nalso accumulated for awards:\n\n10 catches: timed extra ball at left or right loop\n20 catches: 50M\n30 catches: 100M & lights right orbit for 100M\n\n\nFrank Thomas Trading Cards\n\nYou collect trading cards by getting a steal (awarding 1 card), via the Frank\nThomas Trading Cards mode, via a bullpen award, or get 3 cards at the left\noutlane.  At the end of the game you collect 10M per card or you can trade\ncards for goodies at the right scoop when Card Trade is lit.  Trade-ins and\nnumber of cards needed for each are:\n\n 1-2    Flash Left Field for 5M\n     3-4    Advance Inning\n 5-6    Collect Jackpot\n 7-9    Flash Left Field for 50M\n 10-12   Extra Ball or Multiball if EB has already been traded for\n 13-15   Flash Left Field for 100M\n 16      Double Entire Score (!!)\n 17-19   Collect Super Jackpot\n 20-29   Flash Left Field for 500M\n30+     Double Super Jackpot\n\n\nBullpen Awards\n\nBullpen awards are collected at the bullpen hole *after* pop bumper switch\nclosures.  The current bullpen award is changed via pop bumper switch\nclosures in roughly the following order:\n\nExtra Ball (If the EB % is below operator setting)\n5 Cards\nAdd Letter to Grandslam\nLight Double\nHomerun\n Multiball\nAdvance 2 Innings\nAdvance 1 Inning\nCollect Jackpot\n3 Cards\n10 Cards\nGrandslam\nAdvance 1 Inning\nAdd Letter To Big Hurt\nLight Double\nAdd 2 Letters to Grandslam\n\nThe award collected is removed from the list after you collect it.  The\nlist resets after collecting all items.\n\nPlayers Choice Awards\n\nA shot to the right gap when lit for \"Players Choice\" during single ball\nnon-mode play stops the ball and gives the player a choice between two\nawards.  Select an award with the flippers.  The awards are offered in\nthe following sequence:\n\nAdd 2 to GRAND SLAM  or  Multiball\nAdd 2 to GRAND SLAM  or  Light Double\nAdd 2 to GRAND SLAM  or  Hurry Up Extra Ball/Home Run\n Add 2 to GRAND SLAM  or  Advance 2 Innings\nAdd 2 to GRAND SLAM  or  Multiball\nAdd 2 to GRAND SLAM  or  Light Double\nAdd 2 to GRAND SLAM  or  Multiball\n\nDepending on the difficulty setting (?), if you have more then 100M points,\nPlayers Choice is toggled on and off by slingshot hits.  If it isn't on\nyou get 30K points.  Note that if you pick \"add 2 to GRAND SLAM\" then the\nnext Players Choice will be between the exact same 2 choices.  It won't\noffer the next 2 choices until you select the other award.\n\nCombos\n\nCombos score 20M, 40M and then 80M for each *lit* combo shot made in\nsequence.  The first shot in a combo is not lit, but lights the next one.\nI.e. you get points starting with the second shot in a combo.  All combos\nend in the 2-way combo sequence.  Known combos are:\n\n2-way (20M): left scoop/captive ball, then center drop target.\n3-way (20M + 40M): Bullpen/right gap/right hole, then left\nscoop/captive ball, then center drop target.\n4-way (20M + 40M + 80M): right inlane, then left orbit, then left\nscoop/captive ball, then center drop target.\n\nEach shot in a combo must be made in sequence without touching any other\nswitches.\n\nWalks & Steals\n\nIn addition to being a combo sequence, shooting the left scoop and then\ncenter drop target collects whatever was lit at the left scoop (walk,\nor steal).  If walk was lit, steal will start flashing.  Repeat the\nsequence before it times out to get a steal and a trading card (plus\ncombo awards).\n\nBonus\n\nEnd of ball bonus is calculated as:  # of catches x 1M\nAt the end of the game bonus is calculated as:\n(catches x 1M) + (trading cards x 10M) + (runs x 1M).\n\nChamps\n\nThere are several categories of champ you can go for in addition to the\nusual high score list and Grand Champ:\n\nHomerun Champ\nGrand Slam Champ\nCatches Champ\nStolen Bases Champ\n\nThe status display shows how many HRs, GSs, catches and stolen bases you\nhave, as well as the total of the current champ in each category.  Beating\nthe current high in any category lets you enter your initials and gives\nyou a credit.\n\nStrategy\n\nShoot the blinkin' lights!  :-)  Seriously, I'm no pinball wizard, so\ntake my suggestions with a grain of salt, but in general it seems to me\nthat a lot of stuff in the game is worth good points, but the things to\nwork for are raising the regular jackpot up high (shoot the right loop\nwhen it's blinking - always!), then getting the super jackpot to it's\nmax (9th inning), and then going for regular multiball a lot.  It's\nbetter to first work on raising the regular jackpot because then when\nyou get to the 7th inning stretch you can collect a lot of points from\ndouble jackpots.  I've raised the reg jackpot as high as 270M.\nIf the reg jackpot value is high and you've made it to the 9th inning\nthen you're almost guaranteed to get good points out of multiball even\nif you don't collect a super jackpot.  If you do get super jackpots,\nthen all the better.  Every time you get Players Choice always pick the\nright (side) award or you won't advance to subsequent awards and thus\nwon't get more regular multiballs.\nIn the process of trying to do that main goal you'll get modes, EB's\nlit and other good stuff along the way.  Most things are worth\ndoing once they have started, so don't waste them when they do.\nKeep track of your trading cards.  You'll get the most cards out of\nbullpen awards and the Frank Thomas' Trading Cards mode - going for\nsteals to get cards isn't really worthwhile unless you are close to\n16 cards and you want to get there safely (see below).  Trade in 10\nto 12 cards the first time for an EB.  Then the next (and subsequent)\ntimes try to stop your total at exactly 16 which you can trade in to\ndouble your entire score!  If you have a good score (say 1B or more)\nand have somewhat less then 16 cards, it's worthwhile to stop what\nyou are doing and go for steals in order to get to exactly 16 cards\n(each steal awards a card).  Once you get 16 cards, trade them!\nIf you get to 16 cards, be wary of the pop bumpers - there's nothing\nmore frustrating then having 16 cards, trying to get trade cards lit,\naccidentally hitting the ball into the pop bumpers and receiving a\nbullpen award of N cards!  Trust me, this *really* bites!  :-)  If\nyou do go past 16 cards it's probably better to trade for a Super\nJackpot then to try to get enough cards for Double Super Jackpot.\nInstead take the SJ and try to work your way back to 16 cards again.\nIn any case, beyond 16 cards it is better to trade then to not trade.\nBy that I mean to not be fooled by the 10M x trading cards you get\nat the end of the game.  SJ, double SJ or even flash 500M are worth\nmore.\nDon't forget that BH has a combo plunger.  During multiball and the\nmodes where it doesn't already divert the ball, I find it a good idea\nto use the manual plunger before the game kicks the ball itself, and\nplunge the ball lightly so that the ball goes to the BIG HURT pothole.\nThe more double jackpots you get via spelling BIG HURT the better, and\nif it goes to the load bases rollover, that's not bad either.  More\nimportantly the ball will be fed to the pop bumpers and then neatly to\nthe right flipper, which is a lot nicer then a ball screaming around\nand out the left side of the loop.\nAnd don't forget: \"Use the flipper!\"  :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Big Hurt", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb Premier", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/bighurt.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Big Hurt", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

This document is copyright (C)\n1999-2000 by Erik Mooney.\n\n\n                               Introduction:\n\nAs you probably know if you're reading this, Pro Pinball: Big Race USA\nis the latest and greatest pinball simulator from the good folks at\nCunning Developments and published by Empire Interactive.  The last\ntime I did a guide for a Pro Pinball game (The Web), two other people\nused it to knock me out of the world Grand Champion spot.  I'm still a\nlittle miffed about that, but Ade and the boys have outdone themselves\nwith complexity this time around, and I've seen many many requests for\na rulesheet for Big Race USA, so I'll provide one.  This is a \"just\nthe facts\" rulesheet; I'm not providing strategy or suggestions.\n\n** I've taken out the ROT-13 encryption, because the game has been out\nlong enough that I don't think anyone is still concerned about the\nspoilers.\n\nThe information here applies to version 1.18 of the game.  If you have\nnot updated your game, get the patch from Empire's site at\nwww.propinball.com .  The site specifically for Big Race USA can be\nfound at http://www.empire-interactive.com/propinball/brusa if you\ndon't want to navigate through the Shockwave mess of the main site.\n\nAlso, I play on the Windows PC version; most of the info should still\napply to the DOS, Macintosh, and Playstation versions, though there may\nbe small differences (particularly bugs/glitches).\n\nPlease, give me feedback and corrections on this guide.  Anything\nmarked with a (?) needs confirmation!  If for some reason my email\naddresses don't work (the stevens-tech one will expire in May 2001\nwhen I graduate), I'll always be hanging out in the Usenet newsgroup\nrec.games.pinball as long as it exists.\n\nHowever, I cannot provide technical support for any Pro Pinball game!\nI keep getting questions for both The Web and Big Race USA to the\neffect of \"the game won't work/behaves strangely/runs slowly on my\nsystem, can you help?\"  The games run fine on my system; I can't help\nwith these issues.  Go to Empire's site at www.propinball.com and\nfollow the links through to Tech Support.  Similarly, I won't be able\nto help with any other non-game questions like where to buy games.\n\nThis rulesheet doesn't cover Head to Head play at all.  Mostly because\nI'm not a big fan of that mode.  I play a slow, control and strategy\noriented game... Head to Head is pretty much just whoever can make\nshots the fastest.  It's fun, much more intense than, well, anything\nelse, but it's not my type of game.  ** There is a Head-to-Head\nrulesheet by Andreas Grabher, available at my page.\n\nAlso, translations of this rulesheet into other languages for European\nplayers would be welcomed, particularly French. If anyone wants to do\nthat, please do so and let me know!  ** Two German translations are\navailable at my page, thanks to Thilo Herrmann and Michael Weigert.\n\n\n\n                                The Table:\n\nGoing clockwise from the drain, we encounter:\n\nAir Bag:  Acts as a stopper between the flippers, making it hard to\ndrain when this is up.\n\nLeft outlane:  Lights the T in TRUNK.\n\nLeft outer inlane:  Lights the R in TRUNK.  If the MagnoCharger light\nis lit, it lights the magnet on the right ramp for about 10 seconds.\nResets that 10-second timer if it is currently running.\n\nLeft inner inlane:  Lights the U in TRUNK.\n\nOpen the Trunk saucer:  Activates Open the Trunk when lit.  Advances\nthe 3-2-1 lights in front of it during city play.  When 1 is scored,\nthe Hot Rod raises for Drag Speedway Challenge.\n\nHot Rod:  When the Hot Rod car is popped up, you can shoot a ball into\nhim here.  Starts Drag Speedway Challenge during normal city play, and\nis used in that mode and Hot Rod Duel.\n\nLeft Orbit:  Has a spinner on it.  It has a diverter to catch the ball\nif any of the following conditions are met:  Enters the next City if\nlit to do so on the road.  During city play, it enters Jay's Secret\nStash if that is open.  Failing that, it starts Speedway Mania if it\nis lit.  Failing that, it starts Speedway Frenzy if that is lit.  If\nnothing is lit, the ball loops around to the upper right flipper.\n\nLeft ramp:  Advances the 3-2-1 lights in front of it during city play.\nWhen 1 is scored, the Sports Car raises for Oval Speedway Challenge.\nUsually diverts to the lower left flipper.\n\nW and N targets:  Select destination while On the Road (more later.)\nDuring City play, if it has been lit by the Nameless Scoop, it\nunlights and scores $2000.\n\nSports Car:  When it's popped up, shoot a ball into it.  Starts Oval\nSpeedway Challenge during city play, and is used in that mode and\nSports Car Duel.\n\nU-turn:  Shooting multiple U-turns in a row relights Nitro Boost if it\nis unlit: 3 shots for the first time, 5 for the second, then 7, etc.\nStarts Speed Trap if lit to do so on the road.  Advances the Bonus\nMultiplier if lit to do so.  Each shot in a row scores 250,000 more\nthan the previous.\n\nPolice Car Scoop:  If the city mode for the current city has not been\nplayed, it starts.  If that mode has been played, it switches to road\nplay.  On the Road, it starts a Duel if one is lit.  Lit Extra Balls\nmay be collected here at any time.\n\nMagnoLock: This is an under-playfield magnet, located a few inches\ndirectly below the Police Car Scoop.  Its purpose is to catch shots\nexiting the left side of the U-turn, and sometimes fling them into the\nscoop.\n\nMini-ramp:  If this is popped up, it blocks shots to the Police Car\nScoop, making the ball strike the Police Car instead.\n\nCompass target:  Is involved with selecting a destination.\n\nMini-loop:  Hittable from the upper right flipper, and loops back to\nthat same flipper.  During city play, city modes, and Speedway Mania,\ndiverts to the Taxi and locks a Passenger lock if one is lit.  Two\nconsecutive loops opens Jay's if it isn't.  Shooting 3 loops in a row\nlights Extra Ball, once per game.  If that has been achieved, shooting\n10 loops in a row lights an Extra Ball.  I don't know what happens if\nthat has been achieved. :)  Each shot in sequence scores 500,000 more\nthan the previous.\n\nUpper left ramp:  This is the blue ramp just to the left of the taxi.\nUsually diverts to the upper left flipper, but sometimes (during Taxi\nRank Rampage and most speedway challenges) to the lower left flipper.\nRelights the MagnoCharger light.\n\nTaxi:  If closed, hitting it during city play, a city mode, a speedway\nchallenge, Speedway Frenzy, or Speedway Mania advances towards a\nPassenger lock.  If open for the fourth Passenger lock during city\nplay, a city mode, or Speedway Mania, it starts Passenger Frenzy.  On\nthe road, if Video Mode is lit, it starts Video Mode.  Scores\nquickshots if one is running, and is used in many other modes.  Ejects\nthe ball from the Nameless Scoop on the bottom right towards the lower\nleft flipper.\n\nUpper right ramp:  Usually diverts to the upper right flipper, but\nsometimes (usually during speedway challenges) to the lower right\nflipper.  Relights the MagnoCharger light.  There is a very quick ball\nsaver activated when you hit this ramp.  If the ball flies past the\nupper right flipper and directly into the left outlane, the game will\ngive the ball back.\n\nBig loop:  Just above the upper right flipper, and loops back around\nto the upper left flipper.  Behaves the same way as the mini-loop for\nJay's, extra balls, and scoring.\n\nMystery target: Just below the upper right flipper.  It is lit during\nSpeedway Challenges and Duels if you have the correct piece of\nequipment from Jay's.\n\nS and E targets: See W and N targets.\n\nRight ramp:  Advances the 3-2-1 lights in front of it during city\nplay.  When 1 is scored, the Monster Truck raises for Stunt Speedway\nChallenge.  Usually diverts to the lower right flipper.  However:\n\nMagnocharger:  A magnet somewhere under the right ramp.  It grabs the\nball and flings it up the right ramp.  See the Magnocharger section.\n\nMonster Truck:  When he is popped up, shoot a ball into him.  Starts\nStunt Speedway Challenge during city play, and is used in that mode\nand Monster Truck Duel.  He won't pop up if the Magnocharger is\nactive.\n\nRight orbit:  Advances the 3-2-1 lights in front of it during city\nplay.  When 1 is scored, the Mini Beetle raises for Street Speedway\nChallenge.  Loops around to the upper left flipper.\n\nMini Bug (aka Mini Beetle):  When she is popped up, shoot a ball into\nher.  Starts Street Speedway Challenge during city play, and is used\nin that mode and Mini Bug Duel.\n\nNameless scoop:  Just ejects the ball after it enters the Taxi or\nfalls into this scoop.  If a ball falls in here during any city play,\nincluding challenges, Passenger Frenzy, Speedway Frenzy and Mania, and\neven Victory Frenzies, it lights one of the WNSE targets. These\nlightings carry over from city to city.\n\nRight inlane: N in TRUNK.\n\nRight outlane: K in TRUNK.\n\nThe Meter:  On the bottom left of the table.  If you are in a timed\nmode, it shows the time remaining.  If not, it shows your current\nmoney total.\n\nNitro Boost:  The light next to the plunger lane is lit when Nitro\nBoost is available.  If it's available, press the launch button to use\nit, which completes all flashing shots on the table.\n\nThe Hot Rod, Sports Car, Monster Truck, and Mini Bug are collectively\nknown as the \"racers\", and their four shots (saucer, left and right\nramps, and right orbit) are known as the \"racer shots\".  I use that\nterminology quite a bit - sorry if anyone got confused.\n\n\n\n                              Game Features:\n\nThere's a _lot_ of these.  I'll try to tackle them in an orderly\nfashion.\n\n                               Skill Shots:\n\nHitting the upper-right ramp after launching the ball is a Skill Shot,\nscoring the current skill shot value and $5000.  Hitting the big loop\nand then the right ramp in combo is a Super Skill Shot for 2X the\nskill shot value and $10000.  Holding both flippers for a couple\nseconds before launching the ball activates an analog plunger.  To\ncontrol the analog plunger, hold down the launch button to pull back\nthe plunger.  (** you can deactivate the analog plunger by holding\nboth flippers for a couple seconds again.)  Launching the ball to the\nupper-right flipper and hitting the upper left ramp is a Secret Skill\nShot for 3X the skill shot value and $15000.  Finally, using the\nanalog plunger and hitting the mini-loop (passenger lock must not be\nlit) and then the upper left ramp is a Super Secret Skill Shot for 5X\nthe current skill shot value and $25000.  The skill shot value starts\nat 1M and increases by 1M each time you make any type of skill shot\napparently without limit - I've had it as high as 30M.  Making any\nskill shot causes the ball to divert to the lower flippers instead of\nthe upper.\n\n\n                               City Modes:\n\nFirst, you'll notice the map of the USA with 16 lights representing\nvarious cities.  It's arranged as follows (use fixed-width font to\nview).  Note that the designers took certain artistic liberties with\nregards to the city arrangements :)\n\n                          /Chicago\\\n                /Salt Lake\\       /Detroit\\\n        /Seattle\\         /Denver \\       /  Boston  \\\nSan Fran         Las Vegas         Memphis            New York\n        \\Los Ang/         \\Dallas /       \\Washington/\n                \\ Phoenix /       \\Atlanta/\n                          \\Orleans/\n\nIn any city, you can travel to any adjacent city in an adjacent\ncolumn.  You can only travel from right to left unless you have the\nCompass from Jay's.\n\nIn each city, there is a city mode.  These rotate around from game to\ngame, but remain the same within one game.  San Francisco's mode is\nalways the Big Race.  Other than that, the cities are divided into two\n'divisions':\n\nEast: New York, Boston, Washington, Detroit, Memphis, Atlanta, Denver,\nDallas\nWest: Seattle, Los Angeles, Salt Lake, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Chicago,\nNew Orleans\n\nEach division has a set of modes that are randomly assigned to the\ncities in that division at the start of a game.  Completing a\nquickshot for _maximum_ value (10M) or any city mode awards a Big Race\nBooster (BRB).  Taxi quickshots start at 10M, where it stays for about\n6 seconds, and counts down to 2.5M.  After playing a city mode, hit\nthe Police Scoop again to go On the Road.\n\nPassenger Frenzy may be started during any city mode, but not during a\ntaxi quickshot.  Speedway modes may not be started during a city mode.\n\nThe East division modes are:\n\nBonus Bonanza quickshot:  Make the quickshot to start Bonus Bonanza,\nwhich lights the U-turn for 45 seconds.  Hitting the U-turn during\nthat time increases your bonus X by 1 for the first hit, 2 for the\nsecond, and 3 for the third and all later shots.  This is allowed to\nincrease your bonus beyond the normal limit of 10X.\n\nBonus Held quickshot:  Make it to hold your bonus X onto the next\nball.\n\nMoney Spinner quickshot:  Make it to start Money Spinner, which lights\nthe spinner for 45 seconds.  The first spin awards $50, and each spin\nof the spinner awards $50 more than the previous spin.\n\nJay's Giveaway quickshot:  Make it to play Jay's Giveaway (see Jay's\nJunk for more info.)\n\nTaxi Rank Rampage:  You have 20 seconds to hit either lower ramp or\nthe upper left ramp, which will always divert to the lower left\nflipper and give you a 3 second timer to hit the taxi.  Do that 3\ntimes to win the mode and a Big Race Booster; the third time, the taxi\nwill be open and you must get it _in_ the taxi to count.  You get a\nshort airbag after each taxi hit.\n\nSpeed Humps:  Timer is 30 seconds.  All switches score 250,000.  Hit\n10 switches to raise the mini ramp.  Hit the police car to add 250,000\nto the all-switches value and 10 seconds to the timer.  You can do\nthat a maximum of 3 times; doing it twice gets the BRB.\n\nUFO attack:  Timer is 20 seconds.  One lit shot cycles between the\nleft orbit, left ramp, U-turn, right ramp, right orbit, and back\nagain.  The base score is 5M.  Hit the shot to add more time, score\nthe base, add 1M to the base, and randomly move the lit shot. Hit the\nshot 3 times for a BRB.  Before that, each shot resets the timer;\nafter that, each shot adds 10 seconds to a max of 20.\n\nMall Mayhem:  Timer is 40 seconds.  The Trunk saucer, Jay's, Police\nscoop, and the Taxi are all lit for 10M each.  Shoot them all in any\norder to add an extra 5 seconds to the timer and light the U-turn. Hit\nthe lit U-turn to score 10M and the BRB.  MagnoLock will catch the\nball after hitting the U-turn, but won't put it into the scoop.\n\nThe West division modes are:\n\nBig Race Booster quickshot:  Make it for a BRB.  Note that if you hit\nthe quickshot for the maximum 10M, you'll get two BRBs.\n\nExtra Ball quickshot:  Make it for an EB.  If it's made, later visits\nto this city will have an Air Bag quickshot instead: make it to raise\nthe Air Bag for 30 seconds.\n\nNitro Boost quickshot:  Make it to light Nitro Boost.  Nitro Boosts\ndon't stack, so this is wasted if Nitro Boost was already lit.\n\nAttack of the Creature (Tubby): You have 15 seconds on the timer. Each\nspin of the spinner scores 1M (?) and adds 2 seconds to the timer.\nRaise the timer above 35 (?) seconds to escape from Tubby and win a\nBRB.\n\nCar Park Calamity: The upper ramps and loops light.  You start on\nFloor 1.  Shooting either loop scores 1M * floor and might open the\ntaxi if you're on a floor above 1.  Shooting either upper ramp closes\nthe taxi if it was open, advances one floor, scores 1M * the new\nfloor, and adds some time to the timer.  Shoot the taxi when it's open\nto win the mode for a BRB.\n\nCar Wash Chaos: Shoot the left ramp 4 times in 45 seconds for a BRB.\n\nGrid Lock Lunacy: Timer starts with 30 seconds.  The mini-ramp raises.\nIt lowers itself at about six-second intervals for about one second;\nit won't lower if a flipper is being held.  Hit the police car (above\nthe mini-ramp) to score 5M and add 10 seconds to the timer - you can\ndo that any number of times.  Get the ball in the police car scoop to\nscore 30M and the BRB.\n\nBig Race: Always happens in San Francisco, and has its own section.\n\n\n                           Speedway Challenges:\n\n3-2-1 lights can be advanced during any single-ball city play, but not\nduring Challenges.  Shooting 3-2-1 scores 250K, 500K, and 750K for the\nthree shots.  Complete the 3-2-1 lights in front of any racer to make\nthat racer raise.  Hit that racer during city play to start its\nChallenge.  Each Challenge lights three shots: red, yellow, and green.\nYou have 30 seconds on the timer.  Making any of those shots adds 10\nseconds to the timer.  Complete all three of those to raise the racer\nagain; hit it to win for a BRB and $10000.\n\nIf the shots are not completed in red-yellow-green order, each scores\n5M and the racer scores 10M for a total of 25M.  If they are completed\nin order, they score 5M-10M-15M and the racer is 20M for a total of\n50M.  If you complete all four shots in order _fast_enough_, you get\nan extra 10M for a total of 60M, and two BRBs instead of one.  ** It\nseems that the speed bonus is awarded if you take less than 20 seconds\ntotal.  Using a Nitro Boost will count as hitting the first three\nshots in order, so it's pretty easy to hit the racer fast enough for\nthe speed bonus.\n\nIf you have the appropriate piece of equipment from Jay's, the Mystery\ntarget will be lit during that Challenge.  Hitting it spots the next\ncolored shot.  See the Jay's section for more information.\n\nIf the big loop or upper right ramp is lit, shooting the left orbit\nwill make the Jay's saucer do a quick catch-and-release, setting up\na shot.\n\nAfter a Speedway Challenge ends, whether by winning, losing, or\ndraining, its associated Speedway Frenzy becomes lit.  Hit the left\norbit during city play when Jay's is not lit to start all lit Speedway\nFrenzies.\n\n\n                            Speedway Frenzies:\n\nOne ball is added for each Speedway Frenzy you just started.  Shots\ncorresponding to the racers for the Speedway Frenzies you just started\nare lit.  The base jackpot value is 1M times the number of Frenzies\nyou started.  Hitting an unlit racer shot scores the base jackpot\nvalue.  Hitting a lit shot scores the base jackpot and advances it to\nDouble Jackpot.  Scoring Double advances it to Triple.  Scoring Triple\nlights Super, and the shot then stays at Single until the Super is\ncollected, when it can be advanced again.  This sequence runs\nindependently for all lit shots. Scoring any Triple Jackpot gives you\nabout eight seconds of air bag.\n\nSuper Jackpots are collected by shooting either upper ramp, and a\nsingle upper ramp shot will collect all lit Supers.  A Super Jackpot\nis worth 5X the base jackpot value.  If you collect all four Super\nJackpots at once, you instead get an Ultra Jackpot, which is worth 5X\nSuper, or 25X the base value.\n\nThe _first_ time you collect a Super during any Speedway Frenzy, you\nget one BRB for each Super, or 5 BRBs if it's an Ultra.\n\nNitro Boost will count as hitting the upper ramps first and then each\nracer shot simultaneously.  If Triple is lit on a shot, the Nitro will\ncollect that Triple but not the Super.  If a Super is lit, the Nitro\nwill collect it and then the single (advancing that shot to Double.)\n\nConfused yet?  Here's an example.  Suppose you win Stunt Speedway\nChallenge, then lose Drag Speedway Challenge and Street Speedway\nchallenge.  Then you hit the left orbit to start the Speedway Frenzy.\nIt's a four-ball multiball.  The left saucer,right ramp, and right\norbit are lit.  The base jackpot value is 3M.  You hit the unlit left\nramp; it scores 3M.  You hit the unlit left ramp again, it scores\nanother 3M.  You hit the left saucer three times; it scores 3M, 6M,\nand 9M.  You hit the right ramp three times; it scores 3M, 6M, and 9M.\nTwo Super Jackpots are now lit.  You hit the left saucer again, it\nscores 3M and doesn't advance anything.  You hit an upper ramp.  That\nscores two Super Jackpots for a score of 30M, and awards two BRBs. You\nhit the left saucer four more times for 3M, 6M, 9M (Super is now lit),\nand 3M.  You hit an upper ramp for a 15M Super, but no BRB.\n\nThe highest Speedway Frenzy score is kept as the Speedway King high\nscore.\n\n\n                             Speedway Mania:\n\nOnce all four Speedway Frenzies have been played (either all at once\nor spread out), Speedway Mania is lit.  Shoot the left orbit when\nJay's is not lit to start it.  Speedway Mania gives you 60 seconds on\nthe clock, and that timer does not pause for anything.  You get a\ngratis ball saver for about the first 10 seconds.\n\nYou must make quickshots into all four racers to win Speedway Mania.\nOne racer will raise, and a quickshot starts counting down from 20M.\nIf you hit the racer, you score the quickshot value, 20M is added to\nthe base, and another quickshot starts with a racer that has not been\nhit yet.  Do that 4 times to win an Extra Ball and ** $20,000.  A\nquickshot expires after about 6 seconds: the racer drops and the\nquickshot resets back to the base value with the same or a different\nracer.\n\nNitro Boost doesn't work during Speedway Mania.  Passenger Frenzy can\nbe started during Speedway Mania.  (there was a bug in early versions\nof the game that I don't think was ever fixed - occasionally, the game\ntries to play the Passenger and Speedway Mania musics at the same\ntime, causing massive system slowdown.  The workaround is to lower the\nmusic volume to 0 until the modes end.)  After Speedway Mania ends,\nthe 3-2-1 lights reset and you can begin the Speedway sequence again.\n\nSpeedway secret: If you complete all the 3-2-1 lights so that all four\nracers are raised at once, and then hit the left orbit when Jay's isn't\nlit, it gives you a free BRB and starts a four-way Speedway Frenzy\nwithout needing to play the challenges.  This special Speedway Frenzy\ngoes away if you start a challenge before hitting the left orbit.\n\n\n                             Passenger Frenzy:\n\nHitting the Taxi advances towards Passenger locks.  For the first PF,\nyou need to hit the taxi 1, 2, 3, and 4 times to light the first,\nsecond, third, and fourth locks.  Later PFs require 2, 3, 4, and 5\nhits for each lock. (** on Extra Hard, it's 3, 4, 5, and 6.)  Hitting\nthe Taxi towards a lock awards $1.\n\nPassenger Frenzy can be a 2, 3, or 4 ball multiball.  Passenger Frenzy\nstarts when you lock a ball in the last lit lock.  So if two locks are\nlit, and you lock the second ball, it starts; if four locks are lit\nand you lock the third ball, it waits till the fourth ball is locked.\nThe first three locks are achieved by shooting the mini-loop (the taxi\ndoor will open to admit the ball... cute) and the fourth goes in the\nfront of the taxi.\n\nThe Passenger Frenzy jackpot shots are the four racer shots, though\nthe racers stay down.  One jackpot shot will be lit for each ball in\nthe multiball.  The jackpot value is 5M plus $2000.  After you make\nall the jackpot shots (drop off all your passengers), the taxi opens\nfor a double, triple, or super jackpot of 5X jackpot (25M plus $10000)\ndepending on how many passengers you had, and reloads you with that\nmany passengers again, relighting that many jackpot shots.\n\nEach Passenger Frenzy, the first Super Jackpot will also award a BRB.\n\nCow Jackpot:  If you collect four regular jackpots in order from left\nto right, the Super Jackpot will instead be a Cow Jackpot worth twice as\nmuch as super jackpot.  Nitro Boosting the four jackpots does not count\nas hitting them in order.\n\n\n                               Magnocharger:\n\nThis is complicated enough to warrant its own section.  Hitting either\nupper ramp during any single ball play or any multiball except for Big\nRace and Really Big Race lights the green Magnocharger light on the\nleft outer inlane.\n\nWhen the ball trips the left outer inlane switch, and the Magnocharger\nis lit, Magnocharger will activate on the right ramp for about 10\nseconds.  If you hit the inlane during this time, the timer resets. If\nyou do not hit the ramp before the timer expires, the green\nMagnocharger light relights itself, and you must hit that inlane again\nto use the Magnocharger.\n\nWhen you hit the Magnocharger while it is active, the magnet will\nfling the ball up the ramp at high speed for you.  If this happens,\nthe ramp will divert back to the left flipper for another shot at the\nMagnocharger, which will remain lit for about another three seconds.\nMaking a first Magnocharger shot raises the air bag for ** 20 seconds\non normal difficulty, different times for other difficulties; making a\nsequence Magnocharger shot extends its time by a few seconds.  Each\nshot in sequence scores 1M more than the last, to a maximum of 5M.\nThe first and every fifth Magnocharger light video mode (or award 10M\nBig Points if VM is already lit), except for the 10th and 100th\nmagnochargers which light Extra Ball.\n\nThe green Magnocharger light will not come on if the Monster Truck is\nraised (but the game remembers it's lit and relights it when the Truck\ngoes down.)  If the Magnocharger is active when the Monster Truck is\nsupposed to pop up, he will wait until it's inactive.  However, during\nSpeedway Mania, the Monster Truck and Magnocharger ignore each other -\nthis will lead to a graphical glitch if the Truck is up and\nMagnocharger is active at the same time.\n\nI'll give a small hint here: if you want to shoot multiple\nMagnochargers in a row, let the ball bounce off the airbag between\nshots!  Much easier :)\n\n\n                             Open the Trunk:\n\nCompleting TRUNK lights the Open the Trunk saucer.  It can be\ncollected both in the city and on the road.  Lit Trunks do not stack.\nThe TRUNK lights are lane-changeable by the flipper buttons.\n\nThe trick here is that Open the Trunk is _not_random_.\n\nThere's four categories of trunk awards, small, normal, great, and\nsuper.  The category is dependent on which opponent it is, and what\nthe dollar amount is (only matters whether or not it's >1000.)  Here's\nyour chart:\n\nDollars         <1000   >1000\nHot Rod         medium  small\nSports Car      small   medium\nMonster Truck   great   small\nMini Bug        medium  great\n\nAlso, anytime you accept cash of less than 1000, the *next* Open the\nTrunk award will be one category greater than it would otherwise be.\nThis is the only way to get Super awards.\n\nSmall awards are small points and small cash. Medium awards include:\nBig Points, Big Cash, Bonus Boost, Jay's lit, Challenge lit (city\nonly), Duel lit (road only). Great awards include: Really Big Points,\nReally Big Cash, immediate 4-ball Passenger (city only), immediate\nPolice Chase Frenzy (road only), Jay's Giveaway. Super awards are: EB\nlit the first time in any game; every time after that will be a\n90-second Really Big Air Bag.\n\nIf you just sit there and let Open the Trunk time out without choosing\nanything, the trunk will be empty, and you do not get the category boost\ndescribed above.\n\n\n                              Jay's Junk:\n\nProbably the number one frequently asked question about the game.\nHere goes.\n\nTo open Jay's, shoot either loop twice in a row.  It's also lit for\nyou at the start of each ball (** except for Hard and Extra Hard.) To\nenter Jay's, shoot the left orbit in city play.\n\nThe tires, spoilers, engine, and brakes, $3000 each, each correspond\nto one of the four racers.  If you have the corresponding piece of\nequipment, the Mystery target lights during that racer's Speedway\nChallenge and Duel.  Hitting the active Mystery target spots one shot\ntowards that Challenge or Duel.  Also, having the appropriate piece of\nequipment makes it take longer for that racer to overtake you during\nthe Big Race.\n\nLottery Tickets, $1, Cookies, $3, and Extra Ball, $50000: pretty\nobvious.\n\nPlanner, $1000: This is only available when you have already played\nthe city mode for the city, and there is a choice about where to go\nnext (if you don't have the compass, this item won't appear in\nChicago, Salt Lake, Seattle, New Orleans, Phoenix, or Los Angeles.)\nBuying one lets you select your next destination, and immediately puts\nyou On the Road.  If you do not have the compass, you can only go\nleftwards; if you have the compass, you can go to any adjacent city.\nA planner can be overridden by the compass - see On the Road, below.\n\nFerry, $2000: This is available in Chicago or New Orleans after you\nhave played the city mode.  It takes you up or down the Mississippi\nRiver to the other of those two cities.\n\nCruise Control, $2000: Each spin of the spinner increases your Road\nspeed by 2 MPH instead of 1.\n\nCity Guide, $5000: When you're On the Road and the display says \"XXX\nmiles to City, home of ...\", if you have this item, the \"home of ...\"\nwill be filled in, letting you know what mode is in that city.\n\nAir Bag, $5000: 30 seconds of air-filled goodness.\n\nCompass, $10000: Lets you choose your destination.  See On the Road\nbelow.  ** This is unavailable on Extra Easy.\n\nBig Air Bag, $25000: 60 seconds of good-filled airness.\n\nMystery, $100000: Starts Really Big Race, see below.  Only appears if\nyou've qualified for Really Big Race, of course.\n\nBig Mystery, $1000000: Starts Million Dollar Madness, see below.\n\nJay's Giveaway: This can be started either by a city quickshot or from\nOpen the Trunk.  Items from Jay's begin flashing on the display. Press\nboth flippers or the Launch button to take the current item. He will\nnot offer equipment you already have, or a planner or compass or\ncookie.  If you press the launch button while the audio \"Jay's\nGiveaway\" is going, he'll give you a lottery ticket; otherwise lottery\ntickets can't be awarded.\n\nFrom JWJ, here's a list of all the cookies:\n1. LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND DON'T BE GREEDY\n2. YOU'LL NEED TO BE VERY FORTUNATE TO WIN THE JACKPOT\n3. ONE DAY YOU'LL BE A MILLIONAIRE\n4. SPOILERS WILL MAKE YOUR TAXI LOOK REALLY SPORTY\n5. IT TAKES A GREAT ENGINEER TO BUILD A BRIDGE\n6. FEELING TIRED? JUST DON'T BE A MONSTER\n7. TAKE A BREAK AND GET OFF THE STREETS\n8. WITH A COMPASS YOU'LL NEVER LOOK BACK\n9. THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY BIG OUT THERE\n10. GO TO  FOR EXTRA FUN!\n\nAnd their explanations, ROT-13'd (numbers 4-7 indicate which equipment\ncorresponds to which racer):\n1. Refers to the open the trunk category boost.\n2. Probably refers to million dollar madness.\n3. See #2.\n4. Spoilers are the equipment associated with the sports car.\n5. The engine associates with the hot rod (there's a bridge on the DMD\n   in his challenge.)\n6. Tires associate with the monster truck.\n7. Brakes are associated with street speedway challenge (the mini bug.)\n8. This cookie is _wrong_: see Selecting a Destination.\n9. Probably refers to really big race; maybe million dollar madness.\n10. Tells you which city has the extra ball quickshot in this game.\n\n\n\n                         Combos and Maneuvers:\n\nCombos are available during just about any non-multiball time.  Combos\naward increasing numbers of points.  The base value starts at 1M on\neach ball, and is increased by 250K by completing TRUNK.  The\nmultiplier increases by 1 for each combo shot in sequence after the\nfirst.  Having the correct equipment for a racer also increases the\nvalue of their combos - the base is 1M extra for such shots.\n\nCombos progress towards Duels.  To light a Duel, you need to make a\nracer's combo (these are different from the 3-2-1 shots) three times\nto light the Duel the first time, and four times for later Duels.\n\nLegal combos are:                    Advances towards Duel:\n\nUpper right ramp -> left ramp*          Hot Rod\nRight ramp ->       left ramp           Hot Rod\nLeft ramp ->        right ramp          Hot Rod\nUpper left ramp ->  right ramp^         Hot Rod\nBig loop ->         right ramp^         Hot Rod\nRight orbit ->      right ramp^         Hot Rod\nRight ramp ->       left orbit          Sports Car\nLeft ramp ->        left orbit*         Sports Car\nUpper right ramp -> left orbit*         Sports Car\nUpper left ramp ->  right orbit^        Sports Car\nLeft ramp ->        right orbit         Sports Car\nBig loop ->         right orbit^        Sports Car\nRight ramp ->       right orbit*        Sports Car\nMini-loop ->        upper left ramp     Monster Truck\nLeft orbit ->       upper left ramp     Monster Truck\nUpper right ramp -> upper left ramp     Monster Truck\nRight orbit ->      upper right ramp    Monster Truck\nBig loop ->         upper right ramp    Monster Truck\nUpper left ramp ->  upper right ramp    Monster Truck\nLeft orbit ->       mini-loop           Mini Bug\nUpper right ramp -> mini-loop           Mini Bug\nUpper left ramp ->  big loop            Mini Bug\nRight orbit ->      big loop            Mini Bug\n\n*These combos are only available when the first ramp diverts\nproperly to allow you to complete the combo.\n\n^These combos are available anytime; let the ball fall past the\nupper left flipper to the lower left.\n\nShooting multiple loops in a row pauses the combo sequence, letting\nyou continue it when you hit a different shot.  Shooting multiple left\nramps, right ramps/magnochargers, or right orbits consecutively are\nnot combos and cancel the current combo sequence.\n\n\nThere are eight combo maneuvers.  Four of them are short, three- combo\nsequences that count as two combos towards a duel; four of them are\nlong, four-combo sequences that light a duel immediately.  If you\nperform a maneuver, the racer whose duel towards which it counts\nwill announce it.\n\nManeuver       1         2         3         4         Duel\n\nHandbrake Turn L orbit   Mini-loop UL ramp   Big loop  Mini Bug\nBootlegger Rvs L ramp    R ramp    L ramp              Hot Rod\nBarrel Roll    Big loop  UR ramp   Mini-loop           Mini Bug\nFish Tail      R ramp    L ramp    R orbit   R ramp    Hot Rod\nBack Flip      UR ramp   UL ramp   UR ramp   UL ramp   Monster Truck\nPower Slide    UL ramp   R ramp    L orbit             Sports Car\nTwo-Wheeler    R orbit   Big loop  UR ramp             Monster Truck\nDough Nut      Mini-loop UL ramp   Big loop  R orbit   Sports Car\n\nRemember that the first shot of the sequence must be a combo by\nitself.  Example: to do a Barrel Roll, shoot\nUL ramp - big loop - UR ramp - Mini-loop , or\nR orbit - big loop - UR ramp - Mini-loop .\n\nIf a maneuver includes a loop, you can shoot that loop multiple times\nin a row without losing your sequence.  Maneuvers can also overlap:\nif you do a Two-Wheeler, the last two shots are also the first two\nshots of Barrel Roll, so then hitting the mini-loop will get the\nBarrel Roll.\n\nThe short maneuvers score twice as much as the combo would if it were\nnot a maneuver; the long maneuvers score 4X as much.\n\n\n\nI think I've covered all the city features, so now let's go\n\n                                On the Road:\n\nWhen you go On the Road, you start 250 miles away from the next city.\n(the 250 is different for different difficulties.)  Your speed starts\nat 30 MPH.  Each spin of the spinner or hit on the closed taxi\nincreases your speed by 1 MPH, or 2 if you have cruise control. ** Max\nspeed is 100 MPH (taxis just don't go faster than that :) ). Making\nany shot (the Nameless Scoop counts; the left orbit and open taxi do\nnot) subtracts your current speed from the number of miles remaining.\nWhen the distance remaining reaches 0, the left orbit becomes lit to\nenter the next city and you can no longer increase your speed from the\nspinner (you can from the taxi.)  ** Hitting a slingshot subtracts 1\nmile from the distance remaining.\n\nIf you drain on the road, the next ball starts in the next city. ** On\nHard difficulty, this only happens if the distance remaining is 0, and\nit never happens on Extra Hard.  ** Road play is unavailable on Extra\nEasy; after a city mode the game just randomly advances you to another\ncity.\n\nWhen your speed reaches 56 MPH, Speed Trap becomes lit at the U-turn.\nShoot it to start the Police quickshot (see Police Chase Frenzy\nbelow.)  Video Mode can be started by hitting the open Taxi during\nroad play.  Combos and Open the Trunk are still available, but the\nSpeedway sequence is not.  Duels are available by hitting the Police\nScoop when a Duel is lit.\n\nSelecting a Destination:\n\n                          /Chicago\\\n                /Salt Lake\\       /Detroit\\\n        /Seattle\\         /Denver \\       /  Boston  \\\nSan Fran         Las Vegas         Memphis            New York\n        \\Los Ang/         \\Dallas /       \\Washington/\n                \\ Phoenix /       \\Atlanta/\n                          \\Orleans/\n\nThis is confusing.  When you leave a city, the game randomly selects\none of the cities to the left as your destination.  (if you're in\nBoston, it can pick Memphis or Detroit.)  If you bought a planner, the\ncity you select will be your destination.\n\nIf you _do not_ have the compass, this happens:  Each hit of a\nslingshot while on the road changes your destination, but it is always\nto the west.  These changes won't happen if you bought a planner.\nThese changes will happen during Duels and Police Chase Frenzy.\n\nIf you _have_ the compass, this happens.  Now, hitting a valid pair of\nW-N-S-E targets and then the compass target sets your destination. So,\nif you're in Dallas, and hit S and E and the compass target, you will\ngo southeast to Atlanta.  If you're in Salt Lake, and hit N, the W\ntarget will not be active (since you can't go northwest from Salt\nLake.)  These destination changes happen even if you used a planner!\nThese destination changes do not happen during Duels and Police Chase\nFrenzy.\n\nThis is _contradictory_ to the cookie \"With a compass you'll never\nlook back\".  In fact, a compass is the _only_ way to go backwards.\n\n\n                                Video Mode:\n\nIf it is lit, hit the Taxi while on the road to start it.  You drive\nyour taxi through the video mode, killing or avoiding other cars (your\nchoice.)  You start 1000 (miles? yards? it doesn't say) away from your\ndestination, with 60 seconds on the timer.\n\nAfter you kill 10 cars, the police car comes at you.  Kill him to make\na special object appear.  The special object will be a giant pinball,\nor if you've already killed it this game, it'll be a question mark.\nKilling the pinball wins an Extra Ball (duh); killing the question\nmark scores a BRB.  Both police car and special object kills count\ntowards your kill total.\n\nScoring (fixed, thanks to JWJ):\nYou get 500K per kill, and an extra 4M for the police car kill.  Then:\nCompleting VM where nothing got past you, 50M perfect bonus.\nCompleting VM without bumping any other cars: 50M special bonus.\nCompleting VM bumping another car, but no kills: 10M.\nCompleting VM with none of the above: an extra 500K per kill.\nThere is a bug such that you get 500K towards your VM total as\nsoon as the special item appears, and you don't get 500K for killing\nit.  The extra 500K/kill at the end is awarded correctly in any case.\n\nCompleting Video Mode starts you in the next city.\n\n** You can use a Nitro Boost during video mode.  It makes all the cars\ncoming at you come much faster until either the police car appears,\nyou brake, or you hit another car squarely from behind (slowing you\ndown.)\n\nThe highest number of Video Mode kills is kept as the Video Master\nhigh score.\n\n\n                   Speed Trap and Police Chase Frenzy:\n\nWhen Speed Trap is lit, on the road, shoot the U-turn to start Speed\nTrap.  The magnet will grab the ball briefly, then let it go.  This is\na quickshot that starts at 5M and counts down to 1M, where it stays\nfor well over 5 seconds before timing out.  Shoot the U-turn again\nwhile Speed Trap is running to start Police Chase Frenzy.  MagnoLock\nwill catch the ball and fling it into the scoop. There is a quick\nballsaver after the quickshot is started: if the magnet drops the ball\nright down the middle, it'll give it back.\n\nThe jackpot value for Police Chase Frenzy is the value of the\nquickshot when it was made.\n\nPC Frenzy is a 3-ball multiball.  Jackpots are collected at the\nU-turn.  Anytime a jackpot is lit, the mini-ramp will be raised; hit\nthe police car to raise the jackpot by 1M to a max of 10M. Anytime a\njackpot is collected (** unless the jackpot was collected by going the\n\"wrong way\" left to right around the U-turn), the MagnoLock will\nattempt to catch the ball and put it into the scoop.  Collecting a\njackpot also gives you about eight seconds of airbag.\n\nHitting the taxi once lights the U-turn for a jackpot.  After\ncollecting that, hitting the taxi twice lights Double Jackpot.  After\ncollecting that, hitting the taxi three times lights Triple Jackpot.\nCollect the Triple Jackpot, and the taxi will open.\n\nWhen a ball goes into the open taxi, you play \"chicken\" with the\npolice car.  \"Chicken\" is 15-second timer to hit the police car (the\nmini-ramp will raise) for the Super Jackpot of 5X the jackpot value.\n\"Chicken\" keeps going even if multiball ends during it.  The jackpot\nsequence resets back to the beginning after \"chicken\" whether you win\nor lose.\n\nThe first Super Jackpot of a PC Frenzy also awards a BRB and\nrelaunches balls to bring you up to 4 with a short ballsaver.  (I know\nI said I wouldn't do any strategy, but when that 15-second timer is\nabout to expire is a _great_ time to use a nitro boost.) If all but\none ball drains while the taxi is open to play \"chicken\", the taxi\nwill close.  If you hit the taxi within two seconds of it closing,\n\"chicken\" starts anyway, and you can get the SJ and keep the multiball\ngoing.\n\nAfter Police Chase Frenzy, you are still on the road, but the distance\nto the next city is now 0, and you cannot relight Speed Trap while you\nare still on the road.\n\nIf Open the Trunk awards an instant PC Frenzy, the base jackpot value\nwill be 2.5M.  If a ball goes into the saucer during PC Frenzy, it\nwill hold it for about 15 seconds or until a jackpot is scored.\n\n** Police Chase Frenzy is unavailable on Extra Easy difficulty.\n\n\n                                  Duels:\n\nWhen On the Road, you can start a Duel at the Police Scoop if one is\nlit.  If more than one Duel is lit, one is chosen in this priority\norder: Hot Rod, Sports Car, Monster Truck, Mini Beetle.  (This is the\nleft-to-right order on the playfield of the racers.)\n\nWhen a Duel starts, a second ball is launched.  The Duel lasts until\nyou win it or lose a ball.  You get a pretty long ballsaver to start,\naround 30 seconds.  During a Duel, if a ball goes into the saucer\nbefore the racer pops up, it stays there for about 15 seconds or until\nthe racer does pop up.\n\nThe shots that advanced toward that racer's duel begin flashing.  (for\nthe association list, see Combos.)  Hit either of them a total of\nthree times (you get 5M per shot) to raise the racer.  If you have the\ncorrect piece of equipment for that racer, the Mystery target will\nalso be lit; hitting it spots one shot.\n\nPut one ball in the racer for 10M, and the taxi will open; you have\nabout 10 seconds to put the other ball in the taxi for the win, a BRB,\n20M, and $20,000.  If that timer runs out, the racer ejects the ball\nback at you and you must relock it.  Shooting that racer's shot while\nthe timer is running scores 5M and resets the timer.\n\nWhen you lose a Duel, you go back on the road.  When you win a Duel,\nyou go on to the next city, and the ball that you locked in the racer\nstays there until the Big Race.  If you win a Duel while the ballsaver\nis still active (quite possible), the ballsaver keeps going in\nsingle-ball play until it expires.\n\nAfter all four Duels have been played, Police Duel will light.  This\nDuel is started and plays pretty much the same as the others.  The\nassociated shot is the U-turn; hit that three times.  Then lock one\nball in the Police scoop, and put the other in the taxi to win.\nScoring for Police Duel is double that of the other duels, and winning\nlights an Extra Ball.\n\nThe Duel sequence resets after Police Duel if there are no balls\nlocked in the racers.  If any racer holds a ball, the game waits until\nafter the next Big Race to reset the sequence.\n\n** Duels are unavailable on Extra Easy difficulty, and are supposed to\nbe unavailable on Easy difficulty but aren't (see Bugs).\n\n\n                               The Big Race:\n\nWhen you start the city mode in San Francisco, the Big Race starts.\nFor starting, you get 10M, plus 10M for each car you've beaten in a\nDuel, or 100M Pole Position if you've beaten all four.  100 seconds go\nup on the timer, with unlimited ballsaver and airbag.  During the Big\nRace, each lit or flashing shot is worth 2M for each Big Race Booster\nyou have, or 1M if you somehow get here without any BRBs.\n\n(** rewrote this to try to make it clearer) The Big Race is a race\nwith you and the other four racers.  At all times, any racer that you\ncan see (it's raised) is in front of you; any racer that is lowered is\nbehind you.  Racers that you have beaten in Duels start behind you; any\ncar you haven't beaten starts in front of you.  At all times, every\nracer that is lowered will be holding a ball.  The Big Race is a 5-ball\nmultiball; balls held by racers are included in that 5.\n\nAt all times, one raised racer will be flashing.  Hitting it passes it\nand makes it the \"overtaker\".  Hitting an unlit raised racer doesn't\ndo anything; it just ejects the ball.\n\nAt all times, one lowered racer will also be flashing.  This car is\nthe \"overtaker\"; it's trying to pass you.  If you go about 10 seconds\n(20 if you have the right piece of equipment for that car) without\npassing another car, the overtaker passes you - it raises and ejects\nits ball.  Hitting the shot of the overtaker resets that timer, and\nmay change the overtaker to a different car.\n\nWhen less than 25 seconds remain in the Big Race, and you're in first\nplace (all racers are lowered), the taxi will open.  Hit the open taxi\nto win the Big Race for 100M, $50,000, and an Extra Ball.  If time\nexpires, you lose the Big Race; you get 10-40M for fifth through\nsecond places.\n\nAfter winning the Big Race, you play a Victory Frenzy.  This is a\n5-ball Speedway Frenzy, except that the base jackpot is 5M.  Victory\nFrenzy scores are not eligible for Speedway King scores.  Win or lose,\nthe Big Race returns you to New York afterwards.\n\nThe highest Big Race score is kept as the Big Race King high score.\n\n\n                           The Really Big Race:\n\nTo qualify for this, you must: play Speedway Mania, play Police Duel,\nwin Passenger Frenzy (get a Super Jackpot), win Police Chase Frenzy\n(get a Super Jackpot), win the Big Race, and have $100,000.  These six\ntasks correspond to the six blue lights right above the flippers. Each\nof these resets after the Really Big Race (the $100,000 may\nimmediately relight itself.)  To start the Really Big Race, buy it\nfrom Jay's after completing all six tasks (it costs $100,000 to\nstart.)\n\nReally Big Race is a six-ball multiball, unlimited ballsaver and\nairbag.  You must make 15 shots to win.  100 seconds are once again\nput on the timer.  All four racers raise.  You must hit each racer\nthree times; the third time, it'll hold the ball.  These 12 shots\ntotal $50,000 and 50M.  The 13th shot is to hit the police car (the\nmini-ramp will be up) for $50,000 and 50M.  The 14th shot is to hit\nthe police scoop for another $100,000 and 100M; the scoop will hold\nthe ball.  You must lock the last ball in the taxi for the win, an EB,\nand another $300,000 and 300M for a total of $500,000 and 500M.\n\nAfter winning a Really Big Race, you play a Really Big Victory Frenzy.\nThis is a six-ball Speedway Frenzy with the base jackpot being 10M (so\nUltra Jackpot will be 250M.)  Really Big Victory Frenzy scores are not\neligible for Speedway King.  Really Big Race returns you to the city\nyou were in afterward.\n\nUsing a Nitro Boost will spot the first or second shot on each of the\nfour racers, or the mini-ramp shot if that's lit.\n\nIf any racer has a ball locked in it after winning a Duel, that racer\nwill not hold the ball after the third time you shoot it during Really\nBig Race.  This can make it seem as if you have too many balls at the\nend of Really Big Race.\n\n** Really Big Race is unavailable on Extra Easy and Easy difficulties,\nbut see Bugs.\n\n\n                          Million Dollar Madness:\n\nOnce you reach $1,000,000 (** on any difficulty), the game stops\ncounting your money.  You want to go to Jay's and buy the Big Mystery\nto start Million Dollar Madness.  (No qualifications other than the\nmillion dollars are needed.)  You get 1 point for starting\nMillion Dollar Madness, for some reason.\n\nMillion Dollar Madness is a ten ball mode.  The airbag and ballsaver\nare active for about a minute.  Every one of the eighty-four lights on\nthe table is flashing.  Shoot a shot to complete one of its lights.\nAll switches score one million, to a maximum total of one billion.\nComplete all eighty-four lights to score another one billion.  Nitro\nBoost spots one light for each shot, about a dozen total.\n\nThis mode does not end when the multiball ends.  When you're down to\none ball, you must either complete Million Dollar Madness with it or\ndrain it.  Afterwards, win or lose, you will have $0 again.\n\n\n                               Extra Balls:\n\nYou can get extra balls in the following ways.  The first four are\nrepeatable; the rest are once per game.  Lit EBs are collected at the\nPolice Car scoop.\n\nWin the Big Race (lights EB)\nWin the Really Big Race (lights EB)\nWin Police Duel (lights EB)\nWin Speedway Mania (instant EB)\nOne from Jay's (either buy it or win it in the Giveaway; instant EB)\nVideo Mode when you \"kill\" the EB (instant EB)\nThree consecutive loops (lights EB)\nTen consecutive loops (lights EB)\n10 Magnochargers (lights EB)\n100 Magnochargers (lights EB)\nMaxed bonus - increase multipler when you have 10X (lights EB)\nExtra Ball city quickshot (lights EB)\nOpen the Trunk (lights EB)\n\nJWJ reported to me that 40 U-turns lights an EB, and I had listed that\nin previous versions of the rulesheet.  I've been unable to do that,\nthough... playing and shooting for nothing but U-turns, I reached 101\nwithout lighting an EB.\n\nAdditionally, at the end of a game, you can use credits to buy extra\nballs, to a limit of 10 per game.  Credits are won by posting high\nscores, or winning replays, or matching.  The replay score maxes at 1\nbillion.  The maximum number of credits is supposed to be 30, but\nthere seems to be a bug that there is no limit.  It'll only display up\nto 30, but will keep track of more beyond that.\n\n\n                                  Bonus:\n\nShooting either lower ramp during any single ball and most multiball\nplay lights Advance Bonus X at the U-turn.  Shooting the U-turn\ncollects it.  Bonus multiplers advance 1X-2X-4X-6X-8X-10X, though\nBonus Bonanza can change that sequence and go beyond 10X. Advancing\nyour bonus when it is already 10X or higher scores 2M Multiplers Maxed\ninstead.\n\nWhen you drain, you get this much bonus:\n10,000 for every U-turn you've hit.\n20,000 for every Loop you've hit.\n30,000 for every Combo you've hit.\n100,000 for every city you've entered.\n\nThis total is then multiplied by your bonus multiplier.  The bonus is\ncumulative throughout the game; the bonus multiplier resets to 1 after\neach ball unless it's held.\n\n\n                         ** Difficulty Levels:\n\nYou can choose from five preselected difficulty levels, or use custom\nsettings (which means your high scores won't be eligible for the\nofficial high scores website at\nhttp://www.empire-interactive.com/propinball/brusa/hiscores.shtml .)\nThe manual lists all the differences between difficulties on page 20;\nI'm not going to repeat all that.\n\nThe difficulty levels are actually better thought of as complexity\nlevels - Extra Easy is very simple, Easy adds road play, Normal adds\nDuels, and Hard and Extra Hard add better control of your destinations\n(because road distances are longer, and you don't automatically\nadvance to the next city on a drain.)  Million Dollar Madness is\nactually easier to reach on Normal than the easier modes because of\nthe presence of Really Big Race.  Normal makes extra balls available\nfrom Police Duel and Really Big Race that aren't available on easier\nmodes.  Extra Hard can actually be easier than other difficulties\nbecause you'll rarely accidentally advance to a city that you didn't\nwant.  Easy and Normal both offer more Big Race Boosters than easier\ndifficulties, so Big Race scores will be higher.  The list goes on.\n\nMy point is that the difficulty levels don't necessarily mean the game\nis actually harder... it's more like the \"game variations\" of the old\nAtari 2600 game system.\n\n\n                              Miscellaneous:\n\nYou get three tilt warnings per ball; if you use them all and trip the\ntilt sensor again, you tilt, forfeiting the current ball in play and\nits bonus.\n\nSuper City Bonus: If you visit every city at least once before going\nto San Francisco, you get a Super City Bonus of 160,000,000 when you\nstart the Big Race.  However:\n\nUltra City Bonus: If you visit every city once without visiting any\ncities twice before going to San Francisco, you instead get an Ultra\nCity Bonus of 320,000,000 when you start the Big Race.  Note that you\nmust use the Ferry once to do this.\n\nPity award: If you are on your last ball (not a buyin ball) and your\nscore is less than 50M, and you hit Open the Trunk, it will always be\nthe Hot Rod offering $13.  When you open the trunk, it will be either\na Police Chase Frenzy or a 4-ball Passenger Frenzy, depending on\nwhether you are on the road or not.  You can get more than one pity\naward in a game if your score is still low enough.\n\nWhen I was looking at the program file for the list of maneuvers, I\nalso saw the text strings \"SPECIAL\" and \"MOO!\" nearby.  These appear\nto be in the Open the Trunk section (SPECIAL is between EXTRA BALL LIT\nand REALLY BIG AIR BAG), though I don't know if they ever show up.\nAlso, there was no text in there that would correspond to Midnight\nMadness in any way, so that mode most likely does not exist in BRUSA.\nThere's also a bunch of weird text in there like SPOILERS II, SPOILERS\nIII, DELUXE I, DELUXE II, DELUXE III, and SATELLITE that were probably\nremoved during development but didn't quite get cleaned out of the\nprogram.\n\nCheats:  There are no known cheats for Big Race USA, and I'm fairly\nsure that none exist.  If you're finding the game too hard, there are\na couple things you can do.  In the options, you can increase the\nnumber of balls from the default 3 to something higher. Or try playing\nat an easier difficulty setting.  Or experiment with the table\nphysics; lowering the angle makes the game play slower, while\nincreasing the flipper power makes it easier to hit many shots.\nFinally, just practice, practice, practice. :)\n\n** High Scores:  After finishing a game, hold both flippers for a\ncouple seconds and the game will give you a code for that game.  Write\ndown this code and enter it on the official high scores website at\nhttp://www.empire-interactive.com/propinball/brusa/hiscores.shtml .\n(This info is in the manual, but it's kinda buried in the last\nsection, and not many people read the manual anyway.)\n\n\n                                 Bugs:\n\nThere's a small bug with ball movement around the Mini Bug racer. One\nposter reported on rec.games.pinball that, after plunging, he had seen\nthe ball hit the Mini Bug from above and bounce back into the plunger\nlane, which the game counted as a ball-save situation.  I saw a\nsimilar (probably the same) glitch too: Just as a city mode ended, the\nball was on top of the Mini Bug when she popped up.  The ball\ndisappeared and the game immediately went to the bonus countup. I was\nmildly perturbed, to say the least. :)\n\nThere's another small physics bug: the game seems to like to make\nballs jump onto the left habitrail if they go airborne around the\nmini-ramp area.  This is harmless, though.\n\n** On Easy difficulty, Duels and therefore Really Big Race (since you\nneed to play Police Duel) are supposed to be unavailable.  However,\neven though combos and maneuvers don't light Duels, Open the Trunk can\nstill light Duels.  So you can still play the other duels, get Police\nDuel, and therefore Really Big Race on Easy, though it takes luck and\na long time.\n\n** When awarding a very big bonus (greater than about 1.7 billion),\nthe display will sometimes glitch and report only 1.7B for the bonus,\nwith the last few digits seemingly random.  The full value will still\nbe awarded.  If this happens, your score will suddenly have an extra\ndigit 1 in it (so, say, 45900M would become 451900M.)  It's only a\ndisplay bug; it'll fix itself as soon as you score another point. (No,\nI don't know what happens if this happens on your last ball, so that\nit won't have a chance to fix itself.)\n\n** In the options, operator adjustments 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 (number of\ncredits for high scores #3 and #4) seem to be always linked together -\nwhen you change one, the other also changes.\n\n\n                                Credits:\n\nAuthor: Erik Mooney (emooney@attila.stevens-tech.edu ,\nerikmooney@altavista.net)\nMany corrections and info: J.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Black Knight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Black Knight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Knight Rulesheet\nby Ray Johnson (fosher@juno.com)\nAn enhanced revision of Larry DeMar's original Black Knight rulesheet.\n\n\nGame Objectives:\n\n- Lock balls on upper playfield to start Multiball play.\n- Hit drop targets to advance toward Extra Ball, and to light Magna-Save features.\n\nMultiball:\n\nMultiball play on Black Knight involves two or three balls.  Balls are locked on the upper playfield, behind the left drop target bank.  Balls are released for Multiball play by locking three balls on upper playfield, or by locking one or two balls on upper playfield, and another ball in the kickout hole on the lower playfield (behind the right drop target bank).\nThere is no time limit for locking balls for Multiball play.  The game can be adjusted to allow lit \"LOCK\" lights to remain lit from ball to ball, or will reset with each new ball played (default).  The latter is the more difficult setting, and requires the player to lock two or three balls on the upper playfield during the course of one ball-in-play, in order to achieve Multiball play.  See the game's adjustments in the Instruction Booklet for more details.\nDuring Multiball, all scoring is multiplied by the number of balls on the playfield (2X, or 3X).\nDrop Targets:\n\nThere are two banks of drop targets on each playfield level.  Targets on the left side of the playfield are denoted by blue lights in front of them, and targets on the right side are denoted by orange lights.\nThe drop target banks are timed, so after hitting one or more targets in a bank, you have only a limited amount of time to hit the rest of the targets in that bank, before the bank is reset.\nCompleting a bank of drop targets activates a Magna-Save on the lower playfield, if one or both are not lit. (See Magna-Save below.)  Completing a bank of drop targets also lights one of the three arrow lights in front of the bank.  Completing each bank of drop targets on either playfield level three times each, lights the Extra Ball on the upper playfield (see Extra Ball below).\nThe amount of time allowed to the player to complete a bank of drop targets before they reset, is adjustable.  See the Instruction Manual for more information.\nExtra Ball:\n\nThere are two possible ways to achieve an Extra Ball: one on the upper playfield, and one on the lower.\nTo light the first Extra Ball light (upper playfield), the player must complete the upper or lower playfield drop target banks three time each.  Then shoot the ball through the left ramp u-turn on the upper playfield to score the Extra Ball.\nThe second Extra Ball is lit by completing all four drop target banks (upper and lower playfields) three times each.  This lights the Extra Ball in the turn-around on the lower playfield.\nOne arrow in front of a drop target bank is lit each time the bank is completed.\nMystery Score:\n\nWhen the ball goes through the left flipper return lane (which may be assisted by Magna-Save), the center ramp is lit for a short time for Mystery Score.  The Mystery Score is awarded upon completion of the center ramp when lit, and awards a random value of 20,000 to 99,000 points.  (Contrary to today's hyper-inflated-score games, this is a significant award).\nSpinner:\n\nWhen the ball goes through the right flipper return lane (which may also be assisted by Magna-Save), the spinner is lit for a short time for 5,000 points per spin.  A well-placed shot through the spinner can award as much as 100,000 points!\nBonus Multipliers:\n\nThe turn-around on the lower playfield awards bonus multipliers.  When all bonus multipliers have been attained (2X, 3X, 4X, 5X), and bonus value is at maximum, the bonus lights in the \"sword\" on the lower playfield will animate and \"scroll\".  The bell will ring each time additional bonus-awarding targets are made after this point (flipper return lanes, outlanes, and drop target bank completion).\nMagna-Save:\n\nMagna-Save features are activated by completing a bank of three drop targets.  The right Magna-Save will always become activated before the left.  Pressing the red button above the white flipper button will activate the Magna-Save feature for the corresponding side of the playfield.  The Magna-Save feature is used to attempt to \"grab\" the ball, and drop it down the flipper return lane, to allow it to continue in play.  Magna-Save features must be re-activated after being used by completing a drop target bank again.\nThe amount of time that the Magna-Save feature is on, when activated by the player, is adjustable.  See game adjustments in the Instruction Manual.\nBonus Ball:\n\nIf 2 or more players are in the game, the player with the higher score at the end of the game gets a 30 second Bonus Ball (this feature, and it's time limit are adjustable- see Instruction Manual).  \"Bonus Ball\" is actually an unlimited number of balls available to the player, but only for the 30-second period.  So you can lose the ball as often as you wish during Bonus Ball, and it will be replenished, until the 30 seconds has expired.\nThe goal during Bonus Ball is to complete all 4 drop target banks in the 30-second Bonus Ball time, in order to light the turn-around for Special.  The turn-around must be completed to obtain the Special.\nStrategies:\n\n- Go for the Extra Ball.  It is easiest to complete the drop target banks on the upper playfield to light the first Extra Ball (upper playfield).  And drop targets can be completed much faster during Multiball.\n- If center ramp is lit for Mystery Score, and you miss the shot from the lower left flipper, but manage to get the ball up to the upper playfield anyway, allow it to drain back down the center ramp, if possible.  This will award the Mystery Score if you can do it before the Mystery Score light goes out.\n- During Multiball, focus your concentration on the playfield level that has the most balls on it.  That is, if more balls (2 or more) are in play on the upper playfield, focus your attention on the flippers there.  Or if more balls are on the lower playfield, focus your attention there.  The playfield with more balls on it will be the source of more scored points during Multiball.\n- During Multiball, concentrate on making the Mystery Score and Spinner shots when lit, as described above.  This is where the big points come in, especially with the Multiball playfield score multipliers lit.\n- Biggest points are awarded during Multiball.  To get bigger scores, focus on locking balls for Multiball play, and on personal strategies and skills for keeping balls in play longer during Multiball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Black Knight", "possible_shots": "Lock balls on upper playfield, Hit drop targets, Shoot the ball through the left ramp u-turn, Complete the center ramp for Mystery Score, Spin the spinner, Complete the turn-around for bonus multipliers, Activate Magna-Save, Complete all 4 drop target banks for Special during Bonus Ball", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/blackknight.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Black Knight", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Gape in horror as Phaedrus attempts a rule\nsheet entirely from memory! :)\n\n\nObLegalStuff: Black Knight and Black Knight 2000 are undoubtedly\ntrademarks of Williams Co. As far as I know, \"Give me your money!\" is not\nanybody's trademark.\n\n\nObject of the game: Batter down the door and storm the Drawbridge to the\nBlack Knight's castle.  Climb the Skyway for points and extra balls.  Take the\nKnight's Challenge for millions.  Collect the King's Ransom.  You get the\ngeneral idea.\n\nGame Features\n\n\n Dual Playfield\n  Black Knight 2000 is a double-level-playfield design.  The\nball starts out on the upper level, and can drain to the lower through the WAR\nlanes; from there it can drain out of play or reach the upper playfield again\nthrough the Skyway or the Lightning lane.\n Skyway\n  The long ramp up the left side of the machine, that leads from\nthe lower to the upper playfield.  Can be lit for the Hurry-Up bonus by the\nWAR lanes, for the Skyway Million by the KNIGHT targets, and/or for Extra Ball\nby repeated loops.  It also sets up the loop for Ramp-Loop Combo.  Strongly-\nhit balls going up the Skyway will go around the Loop to the upper flipper;\nless-strongly-hit-balls will go down the WIN lanes, and the occasional very\nweak shot may drop down into the bowels of the machine, winding up in the\nLightning hole, which counts as if you'd hit it normally.\n KNIGHT targets\n There are six drop targets in the lower playfield,\narranged in two banks of three; K-N-I on the far left below the Skyway\nentrance, and G-H-T right in the middle.  The targets are on a timer; when you\nfirst hit one, the next letter in BLACK starts flashing, with the flash rate\nincreasing as the timer runs down; all six targets are reset when the timer\nexpires.  Clearing all six targets resets them all, spots a letter in BLACK\nand relights Kickback and Magna-Save.  To make this easier, the two banks\n(K-N-I and G-H-T) are scored separately; so, for example, if you clear K-N-I\nbefore the timer expires, you are given credit for that, and even if the\ntimer then expires, you need only clear G-H-T after that to get the BLACK\nletter and the relights.  If you lose a ball while some targets are down,\nyou still have credit for those targets being down at the start of your\nnext ball, and the timer does not start until you actually hit a drop target\non the new ball.  Spotting the final letter in BLACK lights the Skyway for\nan extra 1M.\n U-Turn lane\n A lane whose two entrances are on either side of the G-H-T\ntargets.  Hitting this lane scores 25K (and adds to your bonus); subsequent\nhits score increasing values, eventually going all the way to 250K.  The\nlane is on a timer, with the flashing rate of the U-Turn lights increasing as\nthe timer runs down; when it runs out, the U-Turn value resets to 25K.\nU-Turn shots also light the Challenge Lane for the Double Knights Challenge.\n Kickback\n The left outlane has a kickback, which is relit by clearing\nthe KNIGHT targets.\n Magna-Save\n The right outlane is protected by the Magna-Save magnet,\nwhich is positioned right above the right inlane.  When Magna-Save is lit (by\nthe KNIGHT targets), hitting the button just above the right flipper button\nturns on the Magna-Save magnet for five seconds; if your timing is quick\nenough, the magnet will snare the ball before it can make it down the outlane,\nhold it in place for a few seconds, then drop it down the right inlane.\n Lightning Lane/Wheel\nThis lane is just to the right of the U-Turn lane,\nand is marked by the \"SPIN\" light.  Hitting it will cause the ball to be\nkicked out onto the upper playfield.  When the \"SPIN\" light is lit (it starts\nthe game lit, goes out when the lane is hit, and is relit for a few seconds\nby the left inlane), hitting this lane spins the Lightning Wheel, which gives\none of the following pseudo-random awards:\n\nPoints\nAnything between 20K and 250K, depending on the wheel slot.\nExpect a lot of 20K's when your score is high...\nExtra Ball, Special\nPretty self-explanatory.\nLower Drawbridge\nOpens up the door to the Drawbridge ramp.\nKnights Challenge\nStarts the Double Knights Challenge round.\nSpot RANSOM\nAdds a letter to RANSOM.\n\n Challenge Lane\nThe lane at the far right of the lower playfield, to the\nright of the Lightning Lane.  Hitting this lane when it's unlit earns you a\nderogatory remark and spits the ball out again; hitting it when it's lit (by\nthe U-Turn lane) starts the Double Knights Challenge round.\n Loop\nThe upper playfield is constructed so that a ball hit low and strong\nfrom the upper flipper will go all the way around the field and back to the\nupper flipper again.  The first loop shot scores 25K (and adds to the bonus);\nconsecutive loop shots after that score 50K, 75K, and so on.  There are\nadditional rewards for consecutive shots.  Two loop shots in a row hold the\nbonus multiplier for the ball.  Also, two loop shots in a row light Extra Ball\non the Skyway for a few seconds; if you collect it, then three loop shots in\na row will be required to light Extra Ball again, and so on.\n WIN lanes\n the three lanes just above the pop bumpers; the plunger feeds\nto this area.  Clearing all three lanes advances the bonus multiplier, and\nlights RANSOM on the Drawbridge for a few seconds.\n Drawbridge\n the ramp on the upper playfield, which leads up to the lock\narea.  At the start of the game, the drawbridge is closed (the door blocks the\nramp); you must hit each of the three parts of the drawbridge, marked by the\n1-2-3 lights (though you don't have to hit them in that order), to open the\nbridge.  After that, shooting a ball up the Drawbridge locks it.  Depending\non the difficulty settings of the machine, and whether or not you've already\nscored a Jackpot this game, the Drawbridge may or may not close again at\nthis point; if it does close, you'll have to hit 1-2-3 again to open it.\nLocking the third ball starts Multiball.  (Note that many BK2K machines have\na slight flaw, which causes balls to occasionally not be read when they\ngo into the lock; to prevent this, it doesn't hurt to gently shake the\nmachine side-to-side for a second or two when the ball enters the lock,\nto make sure it contacts the sensor.)  For a few seconds after the WIN lanes\nare cleared, locking a ball in the Drawbridge spots a letter in RANSOM.\n WAR lanes\n the three rollover lanes just to the left of the upper\nplayfield's flipper.  If the ball actually goes through one of these lanes,\nit drains to the lower playfield; however, in practice, the ball often\nrattles around the entrance to one of these lanes, triggering the sensor,\nthen bounces back out into the upper playfield again.  Clearing the WAR\nlanes lights Hurry-Up on the Skyway; during Double Knights Challenge,\nclearing the WAR lanes scores 1 million.\n Last Chance\n On the final ball of the game, if exactly two balls are\nin the lock, the outlanes light for Last Chance.  Losing a ball down the\noutlane immediately kicks the two locked balls into play.  This can only\nbe used once per player per game.\n\n\nSpecial Scoring Modes\n\n\n Hurry-Up\n This is indicated by the Hurry-Up light on the Skyway.  It's\nlit by clearing the WAR lanes on the upper playfield.  The Hurry-Up value\nstarts at 200K, stays there for a second or two, then counts down by 10K\nintervals to 0; hitting the Skyway awards the Hurry-Up value.  Even if the\nvalue is very low, it's still worth collecting it, because if you do, the\nnext Hurry-Up starts at 500K, then 750K, then 1M, then 1.5M.\n Double Knights Challenge\n This is indicated by the green light on the\nChallenge lane to the right of the lower playfield.  It's lit by making\nU-Turns, and started by hitting the Challenge lane.  This is a 2-ball\nmultiball (so it's unavailable when there are two balls already in the\nlock); another ball is served to the plunger, and the ball in the Challenge\nlane is ejected as soon as the second ball hits a playfield switch.  The\nDrawbridge closes at the start of Double Knights Challenge, and will not\nopen during it.  During the Challenge, clearing the WAR lanes scores 1M.\nWhen a ball drains, you return to normal play, but the Drawbridge is still\nclosed.\n Multiball\n This is started by locking the third ball up the Drawbridge;\nnote that in a multi-player game, the game doesn't distinguish among balls\nlocked by different players, so whoever locks the third ball gets the\nmultiball, and the players who locked the other two balls are out of luck.\nThe object of Multiball is to shoot a ball up the Drawbridge to score the\nJackpot.  Depending on the difficulty settings of the machine, and whether\nor not you have already scored a Jackpot, you may or may not have to\nopen the Drawbridge by hitting 1-2-3 first.  I can't remember whether or\nnot you can collect multiple Jackpots during one Multiball; if you can,\nyou must reopen the Drawbridge between Jackpots, and the Jackpot value\nresets to 1M each time it is collected (it has a maximum value of 4M).\n King's Ransom\n The six letters in R-A-N-S-O-M are displayed on the\nbackglass.  Shooting a ball up the Drawbridge within a few seconds after\nclearing the WIN lanes, or hitting Spot RANSOM on the Lightning Wheel,\nlights an additional letter in RANSOM.  Lit RANSOM letters carry over\nfrom game to game; I can't remember whether they carry over from player\nto player in a multi-player game.  Lighting the final letter in RANSOM\nawards the King's Ransom.  The bonus multiplier goes to its maximum (5x)\nand is held.  For twenty seconds, all three balls are in play, balls are\nfed back to the plunger as fast as they drain, Jackpot is lit, clearing\nthe WAR lanes score 1M, all U-Turns score 250K, and the Skyway scores\n1M and an extra ball the first time it is hit.\n\n\nStrategy\n\nThe simplest strategy for BK2K can be summed up in four words: avoid\nthe lower playfield.  Most of the big points are on the upper playfield,\nand while the ball is on the upper playfield, you can't lose it!\n\nThe most important shot to learn is the Skyway.  You should practice\nit to the point where you can nearly always one-touch a ball draining off\nthe upper playfield right back up into the Skyway off the right flipper,\npreferably without trapping it first.  This one shot will make your score\nskyrocket, since it prevents draining and sets you up for big points from\nHurry-Up and extra balls galore from the Loop.\n\nOn the upper playfield, learn to make Loop shots; they're the key\nto extra balls, and with practice you can also learn to drop the ball into\nthe WIN lanes to light Ransom.  When Hurry-Up or Extra Ball lights on the\nSkyway, don't be afraid to let the ball drain to the lower playfield\nto collect it; once you've practiced the Skyway shot sufficiently, the\nreward is well worth the minor risk.  Also, it's vital to learn the art\nof nudging the ball around the WAR lanes; a good player can nearly\nalways make the ball dribble its way across the tops of the lanes to the\nupper flipper, keeping it on the upper playfield, and probably getting\ncredit for at least one of the lanes in the process, even on a machine\nwith pretty tight tilt settings.\n\nDuring Multiballs, you pretty well have no choice but to learn to\ndeal with the lower playfield.  The Challenge Lane will hold onto a ball\ngoing into it for about ten seconds before letting it go, which is a\ngood way of getting a ball out of the way.  Also, don't forget the\nLightning Lane; even if it's not lit, it still gets the ball back to the\nupper playfield.  Multiballs are also a good time to shoot for the KNIGHT\ntargets, if you need to relight the Kickback or Magna-Save; with all\nthe balls bouncing around, you'll hit your share of drop targets anyway.\nI recommend _not_ shooting at the drop targets unless you need to relight\nsomething; every time you clear them, the timer accelerates, so it gets\nthat much harder to clear them when you actually need them.  And the\nbonus for completing BLACK is pretty paltry; you can get much greater\nrewards by concentrating on the upper playfield and making your Hurry-Ups.\n\nDuring King's Ransom, concentrate on making the Skyway and Drawbridge\nshots at least once each, since that's where the big points are.  Don't\nmess up your shots with the balls already on the playfield just to\nplunge a new ball in (unless you're going to use the new ball to shoot\nfor the Jackpot); in particular, if a ball pops into the plunger lane\nwith less than five seconds left in King's Ransom, and you're confident\nthat you're not going to lose one of the balls in play in the next few\nseconds, leave it there!  It's effectively an extra ball; when King's\nRansom ends, just leave the other ball in the plunger lane, and plunge\nit out when you finally lose the last ball in play.\n\nInternet: phaedrus@halcyon.com (Seattle, WA Public Access Unix)\n\n\"How'd you like to move a few steps down the food chain, pal?\"\n\nIf you enjoy fantasy/SF stories with transformation themes, email me\nfor a copy of the Transformation Stories List.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Black Knight 2000", "possible_shots": "Dual Playfield, Skyway, KNIGHT targets, U-Turn lane, Kickback, Magna-Save, Lightning Lane/Wheel, Challenge Lane, Loop, WIN lanes, Drawbridge, WAR lanes, Last Chance, Hurry-Up, Double Knights Challenge, Multiball, King's Ransom", "manufacturer": "Williams Co.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/blackknight2000.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Black Knight 2000", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I've\nused the left flipper many times to snatch a RANSOM letter from the jaws of\ndefeat.  With the drawbridge DOWN (duh, really?), complete the WIN (the advance\nRANSOM bolt will start to flash).  If the ball drops through (you were unable\nto get the top flipper on it), let the ball bounce off the right flipper and\non over to the left flipper.  Then shoot the ball up the Lightning Wheel.

Thus all\nyou have to do is repeat over and over again the one shot up the left\nramp until war is lit and you get a million - and you just keep on\ngoing. This is incredibly easy with only one ball to look after and I\ndont think it was just an idiosyncracy of our machine.\n\nWhile I am here I might as well give my all time favorites.

If you notice,\nduring hurry-up, there's a score that decreases on the backplane\nwhich is the amount of the bonus. My strategy is to catch the\npinball as it comes down from the top with the right flipper than\ntake the ramp shot. The bonus rotates through a cycle of 200K,\n500K, 750K, 1M. I typically get from 60-100% of that depending on\nhow much spin the ball has when it comes down.\n\nThe same shot is worth an extra ball if you make several loops in\ncombo; this is actually a bit of a bribe shot. You get very\nlittle time to make the shot and you need to be quite good to get\nit. I usually keep up a run of loops and only try for the extra\nball if the ball drops on its own. Making additional loops keeps\nthe extra ball light on while you're doing it and the loops are\nquite valuable.\n\nDouble Knight's challenge is activated by making a turn-around\nthen trapping the ball in the lower right (where it says \"No\nway\", most of the time). You then get a second ball and if you\nspell WAR before one of the balls drain, you get a million\npoints. The secret here is to keep the second ball on top and\nsend the first up via the lightening wheel path (alternatively,\nthe trap for starting Double Knight's challenge will hold the\nball for about five seconds).\n\n-dh\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Black Knight 2000", "possible_shots": "the bridge, the loop, the u-turn, the skyway, the lock hole", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/blackknight2000-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

Scores, times etc may vary.\n\nThe Playfield\n\nBlack Rose has two normal length lower flippers in the usual place, a full\nlength upper-right flipper, two normal slingshots, a proper plunger with a\nspring, a big red button marked \"Fire!\" and, from lower left:\n\n\n Pirates Cove  A very short orbit shot at the left side of the machine,\nturning sharply inwards to sit on a kickout. This is the lock\nshot.\n\n Left Ramp  A long straight ramp starting right next to the Pirate's\nCove, near the flippers, and feeding to the upper flipper.\nThe jackpot is collected here when lit, and this is the first\nshot in the three way combo.\n\n Torch Targets  A bank of three yellow standup targets, facing right. The\nskill shot is to hit these, and completing all three sets of\nstandups opens the locker.\n\n Upper Ramp  A looping ramp, shot from the upper flipper and feeding back\nto it. Looping it a few times will cause it to lift, opening...\n\n Locker  Underneath the upper ramp, shooting this shot puts the ball\nin the cannon, from which you then shoot what you're told for\na variety of interesting awards.\n\n Back Loop  Shot from the upper flipper, this loop feeds down the left\norbit. It's the second shot in the three-way combo, and the\nsource of one of the two cows in the game.\n\n Bomb Targets  A bank of three red standup targets, facing down and slightly\nto the right. See torch targets.\n\n Broadside  A hole in the centre of the top of the machine. More later!\n\n Gap  A little gap the ball can slip through to get in or out of\nthe pop bumpers. Kinda like the one on Dr Who.\n Gunpowder Targets  A bank of three green standup targets, facing left and\nslightly downwards. See torch targets.\n\n Right Ramp  (also known as the whirlpool) A spiraling ramp which feeds\nto the left inlane for repeat shots. Slow shots around here\nwill fall into the...\n\n Pop bumpers  These are quite well hidden, you could play the game and not\nrealise it had any (I did). The score from these depends on...\n\n Right orbit  Up past the upper right flipper and into the pops. Shots up\nhere add 1000 to the value of the pops, which start at 1000.\nReal big points ;) The game also has a bad habit of not\ncounting these points until the display has finished showing\nother sequences.\n\n Broadside Target  A single yellow standup target, facing to the right. Works\ntowards lighting broadside (more later) or spots a standup if\nthe broadside is already lit.\n\n In/Outlanes  The word LOCK is written across them, one letter per lane.\nRolling over the relevant rollover lights the letter, and the\nlit letters can be cycled either way with the flippers.\n\n The cannon  That thing badly set into the playfield just above the\nflippers. The ball ends up here and you get to shoot things\nwith it.\n\n The big metal thing in the middle  This is the feed from the broadside shot back to the right\nflipper, and works very well. The ball comes screaming down\nhere, hits the bit of metal at the end and lands on the\nflipper slow enough that you simply have to hold it up and\nit's caught.\n\n\nThe Whirlpool\n\nThe first shot up the right ramp on a ball is worth 100K, the second\n200K, the third 300K, the fourth 400K, the fifth an extra ball and the sixth\nand later shots are worth a million. It's possible the extra ball shot is also\nworth a million.\n\nActually, that's not quite true. There's a timer. Before the million is\nlit, the awards step down one at a time, pretty slowly. After you get to\nthe million, they all time out at once. After a multiball, they'll all be\nreset. But you can't collect more than one extra ball from here on a ball.\n\nRandom Awards\n\nThroughout, if I refer to a random award without further information,\nit's chosen from this list.\n\n Extra Ball\n Light Jackpot\n 2 Million\n 1 Million\n 1/2 Million\n Spot letter\n Open locker\n\n\nand possibly others. The only one that isn't obvious is spot letter, and this\nspots a letter in \"Sink Ship\" (more later) and not in LOCK.\n\nThe Broadside\n\nThere are seven awards available from here in normal play, and they're\nwritten up the middle of the playfield. Which one you'll get changes quite\nquickly (about 4 times a second). Once you've collected an award, it'll stay\nlit and won't be available again until you've collected them all. The awards,\nin the order they cycle, are\n\n\n Polly Says  A random award.\n\n Knife Throw  One of the three video modes in the game. You'll be\noffered a random award if you can hit the barrel with\nthe knife, and you have to press the \"Fire!\" button at\nthe right moment.\n\n Instant Multiball  Gee, what does this one do?\n\n Walk the Plank  Another video mode. Hammer the fire button as fast as\nyou can to outrun the shark and win a random award.\nLike the other video modes, you're told what you'll win\nbefore you play.\n\n Treasure  Awards a random number of points, which seems to be\nbetween .5M and 2.5M.\n\n Rigging Swing  The third video mode. Press \"Fire!\" at the right time\nto land on the ship and win a random award.\n\n Millions +  All ramp shots score million plus. Note that you\ndon't have to concentrate on a single ramp, they all\ngo up a million whichever one you hit.\n\n\nOnce you've shot the broadside and gotten the ball back, there's a\ntwo million point hurry-up award for shooting it again, which relights it.\nThis hurry up bottoms out at 500K and times out after a while, after which\npoint you'll have to shoot the broadside once to restart the countdown and\nagain to get the points and actually relight it.\n\nWhenever the broadside isn't lit for an award, hitting the broadside\ntarget counts as shooting the broadside - it will start the countdown, or\ncollect the points and light the broadside, or, if you hit it twice, do both.\n\nOnce all seven awards have been collected, the broadside is lit for\nlight jackpot. It stays lit until you shoot it or the end of the ball, and then\nthe broadside resets unlit.\n\nThe Jackpot\n\nThe jackpot lives on the left ramp, and it's worth 5 million plus\nadditions for various things which carry over between games. It can get as\nhigh as 15 million or so, but I always seem to collect it before then, so I\ndon't know how high it can go.\n\nIt also has an annoying habit of obscuring everything else the game\nwould normally display with the value of the jackpot, so even when it's worth\nvery little it's worth getting it out of the way.\n\nThe Cannon\n\nThe cannon is loaded by shooting the ball into the open locker. You\ncan open the locker three ways - the skillshot, completing the three sets of\nstandup targets, or looping the upper ramp a few times. Once the ball is in\nthe locker, it'll roll down under the table, and once it's sitting on the\nkicker, the cannon will light up and turn from side to side. Some of the shots\non the table will be lit, and you'll be offered an award for hitting a lit\nshot. You press the fire button to fire ;)\n\nIf you miss, the locker will reopen, and you get a countdown (about\nten seconds I think) for an \"instant reload.\" Whether you make the timer or\nhave to reopen the locker, I believe you shoot for the same award until you\nmanage to collect it.\n\nIf you hit your shot, or rebound onto a set of standups that also\nhappened to be lit ;), you get the award you were promised plus a letter in\n\"Sink Ship\" - more about that later.\n\nThe first three awards, in order, are \"Double Broadside\", video mode\nand 5 Million. They continue to follow the same pattern, but I can't remember\nwhere it goes next.\n\n\n Double Broadside  If you're accurate, this is the most lucrative\nscoring round in the game. You get a 30 second timer,\nand the broadside shot is lit for a million points.\nOnce you collect that, it's lit for 2 million, then 4\nmillion, 8 million, 16 million, then 32 million. It\nmaxes out at 32 million, and you can collect this\nmultiple times.\n\n Video Mode  Starts one of the three modes at random.\n\n 5 Million  Gee, I dunno.\n\n\nMultiball\n\nYou can start multiball in two ways. Get awarded \"Instant Multiball\"\nor complete the LOCK letters and shoot the lock. Yes, as soon as you lock ball\none, you start two ball multiball.\n\nDuring two ball multiball, all three ramps are worth a million points\nplus a \"Sink Ship\" letter, and the lock shot is lit. Shooting one ball into\nthe lock starts a timer, and shooting the other in there before the timer runs\nout serves up a third ball at the plunger for three ball multiball. I have no\nidea if anything is different in three-ball, or if the lock awards anything.\n\nAnd that leads us on to...\n\nSinking Ships\n\nAs you may have guessed already, sinking ships has more than a little\nto do with those \"Sink Ship\" letters written across the playfield. You can\ncollect your letters in many ways, and as soon as you're in single ball play\nwith \"Sink Ship\" all lit, the locker will be open to load the cannon to sink\na ship.\n\nShooting the locker loads the cannon, gives a quote \"Send 'em to Davy\nJones!\" and lights the broadside shot, which isn't trivial from the cannon.\nHitting sinks a ship, missing puts you back a step to trying to shoot the\nlocker.\n\nFor your first ship, 4 \"Sink Ship\" letters are spotted, and then one\nless letter is spotted after each ship sunk. Letters can be collected in\nadvance and will be held over, so with one good multiball you can light two\nor even more ships to be sunk at once.\n\nThe first ship is worth 20 million, the second 30 and the third 40. I\nimagine this trend continues to a point and then maxes out, but I don't know\nwhere.\n\nSinking some number of ships will light special on the left (Pirate's\nCove) and right orbits. On the local machine, this is currently two, but I\nwouldn't be surprised if it reflexed.\n\nThere is a position on the high score table for most ships sunk, and\nsinking the same number of ships as the previous holder will win it.\n\nCows\n\nThere are two cows I've found in Black Rose, and I don't actually know\nhow to make either of them appear reliably.\n\nSometimes a shot around the back orbit will generate a whole herd of\ncows all over the screen and a nice mooing noise, and sometimes, instead of\nmen fencing while the ball is in the pops, you get cows.\n\nBragging\n\nMy personal best so far is 288 million, with three ships and 95 million\nfrom Double Broadside. My most ships is three, my best Double Broadside is\n159 million.\n\nCredits\n\nKevin Martin for the disclaimer at the top and the general\nformat, both of which I blatantly stole without permission ;)\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Black Rose", "possible_shots": "Pirates Cove, Left Ramp, Torch Targets, Upper Ramp, Locker, Back Loop, Bomb Targets, Broadside, Gap, Gunpowder Targets, Right Ramp, Pop bumpers, Right orbit, Broadside Target, In/Outlanes, The cannon, The big metal thing in the middle", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/blackrose.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Black Rose", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

The features are, in general, described from left\nto right within their playfield.\n\nGeneral\n\n\n Playfields  The game is mostly molded plastic, with three workable playfields:\na raised upper playfield, a normal playfield, and a \"backwards\" playfield\nthat takes the place of the usual instruction and credits sheets.\n Flippers  There are five full-length flippers - two on the upper playfield,\ntwo on the normal playfield, and one on the left side of the \"backwards\"\nplayfield.\n Controls  There are two buttons on each side of the machine, white (upper) and\ngreen (lower).  The white buttons control the flippers on their respective\nside; the green buttons lower the starting gate and select the flashing goal\n(see below).\n Manual Plunger  This is a normal plunger.  The only purpose the plunger serves\nis to send the balls to the Starting Gate (see below).  There is no skill\nshot, and one wonders why a automatic plunger wasn't used instead.  Then\nagain, considering how reliable automatic plungers were in 1988, perhaps it's\njust as well.\n Display  the display is composed of four banks of 7-digit 16-segment displays\nin a row near the bottom of the backglass.\n\nUpper Playfield\n\n\n Starting Gate  The plunger sends the balls up a molded plastic ramp that turns\nto the left, goes through a uni-directional swinging gate sensor while making\na hairpin turn, and to a small horizontal reservoir that holds three balls.\nBehind the reservoir there are three lights colored red, yellow, and green\nrespectively, with the green on the right, right above the first ball to\nenter the reservoir.  In front of the reservoir is a metal gate that can\nlower and allow the balls to roll into the Starting Ramp.\n Starting Ramp  After being released by the Starting Gate, the balls roll down\na molded plastic ramp that makes a hairpin curve and feeds the balls\nright above the upper right flipper in the Right Loop.  It is sometimes\npossible for a ball coming from the Left Loop to have enough momentum to\ngo slightly up the Starting Ramp, but never all the way.\n Right Loop  This lane goes from just right of the Upper Saucer under the\nStarting Gate, feeding into the upper right flipper.  [Presumably,] a\nsingle rollover switch is inside the orbit.  This switch lights the Left\nLoop, and collects 100K and advances the Bonus Multiplier when it is lit.\n Rocks Targets  These are three yellow stand-up targets between the two exits\nof the Right Loop.  They are labeled with three yellow lights (l-r): \"MEAN\",\n\"MOON\", and \"ROCKS\".  The targets are at the top of a raised upward\ngradient, so balls need quite a lot of momentum to hit these targets.  It is\nbasically impossible to hit these targets from anything but the upper left\nflipper.  Lighting (hitting) all three targets completes the Rocks Section.\n Cliff Hanger Loop  The entrance to this loop is just to the left of the Rocks\nTargets, and to the right of the Right Loop entrance, and is labeled with\na blue light saying \"CLIFF HANGER!\".  It shares the raised\ngradient with the Rocks Targets.  The loop continues around a raised\nhalf-ramp to the left, behind the Upper Saucer, and exits off a cliff\nslightly to the right of the Left Loop entrance.  The sensor for this loop\nis a rollover on the section of wall (!) above and behind the Upper Saucer.\nHitting the sensor lights the light and completes the Cliff Hanger Section.\nA ball without sufficient inertia will not traverse the entire loop; however,\nit only needs to hit the sensor to register.  An projection in front of the\nsensor prevents balls from dropping into the Upper Saucer.\n Upper Saucer  This saucer is located underneath the Cliff Hanger Loop and\nbetween the Right and Left Loop entrances.  It functions as a ball Hold and\nalso starts the Special Test.  When ejecting, it sends the ball towards the\nupper right flipper.  It is reachable by either upper flipper.\n Left Loop  This lane goes from just left of the Upper Saucer under the\nDownhill Ramp, feeding into the upper left flipper.  [Presumably,] a\nsingle rollover switch is inside the orbit.  This switch lights the Right\nLoop, and collects 100K and advances the Bonus Multiplier when lit.  The\nLoop has a standard white light near its entrance.  The Hill Climb Ramp\nfeeds into this Loop, usually coming out near the typical exit, but coming\nout the \"entrance\" if the ball has enough inertia.\n Downhill Ramp  This is a steep ramp that only the upper right flipper can\nsend a ball to.  A ball sent up this ramp goes through a bidirectional\nswinging gate to a raised platform at the upper left of the machine.  It then\ntriggers a gate sensor, lighting the red light that says \"DOWNHILL!\" and\nfinishing the Downhill Section.  The ball rolls down the narrowing platform\ndown the left edge of the machine, down and up a dip, and is deposited\nright \"above\" the backwards flipper in the Backwards Playfield.  This ramp\nis also part of the Special Test.\n Bog Targets  These are three stand-up targets between the Downhill Ramp\nentrance and the Left Loop.  Unlike the Rocks Targets, these targets are\nnot raised and are as a consequence easier to hit, the fact that balls load\nto the upper right flipper notwithstanding.  They are labeled with three\ngreen lights (l-r): \"BIG\", \"BAD\", \"BOG\".  Lighting (hitting) all three\ntargets completes the Bog Section.\n Center Pin  This is a triangular shaped bumper between the upper flippers,\ndecorated on top with a sign saying \"DAVIS W. Va.\".  The consequence of this\nbumper is that balls rarely go SDTM from the Upper Playfield, and that\na skilled player can keep balls in the Upper Playfield for quite some time.\n Slingshots  The Upper Playfield has no slingshots.\n Exits  A ball can exit the Upper Playfield only by leaving below the upper\nflippers to the Lower Playfield, or via the Downhill Ramp to the Backwards\nPlayfield.\n\n\nLower Playfield\n\n\n Lower Saucer  This saucer is located right above the right outlane, although\nit is separated from the latter by two pins.  It functions as a ball Hold.\nBalls exiting the right side of the Backwards Playfield get deposited to this\nsaucer; if there is already a ball in the saucer the ball drops to the left\nnear the right inlane.  It is also reachable by the lower left flipper, and\nis the final part of the Special Test.\n Hwy 93  This is a steep ramp just above the Lower Saucer that runs along a\nwall, hits a gate sensor jutting out of the wall at its peak, and ends just\nabove the upper right flipper in the Upper Playfield.  It has a red light\nlabeled \"HWY 93!\" that lights and completes the Hwy 93 Section when the\nsensor is triggered.  It is possible to send the ball up the ramp and fall\nshort of hitting the sensor, even to the extent that the upper right flipper\ncan catch it.  (I have never been able to score Hwy 93 from a held ball on\nthe lower left flipper; there just isn't enough momentum the flipper can\nimpart to the ball.)\n Lower Loop  This is a loop that goes under the Upper Playfield and has two\nexits.  There are a sufficient number of sensors (of unknown type, but\nprobably roll-over) that can detect which way the ball is going through the\nloop.  The right exit is more easily entered from the lower left flipper\nand deposits balls to the right flipper, and vice versa for the other exit.\nThis means that it is easier to make consecutive loops in the same direction\nthan it is to alternate directions.  Each direction/entrance has its own\nsets of lights that award up to three point values (white lights) and a\nSave-It! (large orange light) each.\n Swamp Targets  This is a row of five drop-targets between the two exits of the\nLower Loop.  Each target has a \"S\" logo on it (Suzuki was one of the\nsponsors).  There are five green lights below the targets, in two rows of\nthree and two, labeled (l-r,u-d) \"NEVER\", \"ENDIN\", \"BIKE\", \"SUCKIN\",\n\"SWAMP\".  The lights do NOT correspond to the targets; rather, one light\nlights up in sequence every time all the targets are knocked down and the\nbank is reset.  (If the target bank is faulty, it is possible to register\na target as \"down\" even though it is not physically down.) Lighting up all\nthe lights (hitting all five targets five times) completes the Swamp Section.\n Hill Climb Ramp  This is a wide, shallow ramp to the left of the left Lower\nLoop exit that is reachable by the lower right flipper and deposits the ball\ninto the Left Loop in the Upper Playfield.  A (probably roll-over) sensor is\nlocated very near the top of the ramp that lights the yellow light labeled\n\"HILL CLIMB!\" at the base of the ramp for the Hill Climb Section.  Although\nsignificantly easier than Hwy 93, the Hill Climb Ramp has two problems: (1)\nThe sensor can be triggered without the ball actually getting to the Upper\nPlayfield, at which point the ball surprisingly comes back down very close\nto the middle; and (2) there is an unprotected inset light bulb right in the\nmiddle of the ramp near the entrance, and the ball can lose quite a bit of\nmomentum when skipping over this \"bump\".\n Rapids Targets  These are four stand-up targets to the left of the Hill Climb\nRamp just above the left in/outlanes.  They are labeled with blue lights\n(u-d): \"COLD\", \"WET\", \"ROCKY\", \"RAPIDS\".  Lighting (hitting) all four\ncompletes the Rapids Section.  These targets are barely hittable from the lower\nright flipper.\n Left Outlane  This lane collects Save-It! when lit (with a orange light).\n Left Inlane  This lane collects Special when lit (with a red light).\nBalls exiting the left side of the Backwards Playfield get deposited here.\n Slingshots  Normal configuration.\n Right Inlane  This lane collects Special when lit (with a red light).\nThe light indicating that Save-It! is collected is also located\nhere, right above the lower right flipper (there isn't much visibility\nbelow the two flippers where an extra-ball light would typically go).\n Right Outlane  This lane collects Save-It! when lit (with a orange light).\n Exits  A ball can leave the playfield by either going to the Upper\nPlayfield via Hwy 93 or Hill Climb, or by draining.\n Drains  Either outlane or STDM.  All three of these exits are hard to\nget to, especially the outlanes, so many Save-It!s go uncollected.\n\n\nBackwards Playfield\n\n\n Description  This playfield is located where the instructions and pricing\ncard are usually located, and slants down *away* from the player.  Hence,\n\"above\" will be used to mean *towards* the player, and \"below\" will be\nused to mean *away* from the player.\n Flipper  A single flipper on the left side that flips \"upwards\" *towards*\nthe player.  The only entrance to the Backwards Playfield is from the\nDownhill Ramp in the Upper Playfield, and it deposits a ball right \"above\"\nthe flipper.\n RA-I-N targets - these are four stand-up targets located right in\nthe middle.  Hitting all of these targets raises the Playfield Multiplier.\nThey each have an associated blue light.\n Fast Line!  This is a curve on the lower \"above\" right of the playfield.\nAt the corner of the curve is a single gate sensor flanked by a pin and\nthe wall.  If the player manages to trigger this gate, typically the\nflashing Section is awarded.  The only way to trigger the Fast Line! is a\nperfect shot from the flipper.\n Exits  If the ball settles on the left side, it rolls down past the\nflipper (no hope of touching it) to the left inlane in the Lower Playfield.\nIf it settles on the right side (e.g., from the Fast Line!), the\nball gets sent towards the Lower Saucer in the Lower Playfield.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nPlayers\n\nUp to four players can be registered, each with their own 7-character bank.\nEach player finishes a Heat and all Save-It!s before play continues to the\nnext player.\n\nBalls\n\nInstead of the typical pinball game which gives 1 ball until it drains for\nthree times, Blackwater 100 gives 3 \"Heats\" of at least three balls each.  For\neach Heat, three balls must be loaded to the Starting Gate, at which point the\nStarting Countdown begins.  An extra credit can buy in anywhere from 1 to 3\nextra Heats, depending on operator setting.  The player has 15 seconds after\nHeat 3 to press the start button to continue.  Pressing either green button\ncancels the Buy-In.  Supposedly there exist some machines with replaced ROMs\nthat only give one ball per heat, but I have yet to see one.\n\nPlayfield Multiplier\n\nBy getting to the Backwards Playfield multiple times, you can hit the R-A-I-N\ntargets to increase the Playfield Multiplier.  The targets stay lit between\nHeats.  Lighting all of them raises the Playfield Multiplier to 2x, lighting\nthem again raises it to 3x, and again for a maximum of 4x.  This is quite\nlucrative as *every* score gets that multiplier for the rest of that Heat,\nincluding Save-Its! and the Bonus.  Note that although it displays your normal\nbonus, the multiple bonus is added to your score.  After the Heat, the\nmultiplier goes away..\n\nStarting Countdown\n\nWhile the balls are being loaded, the red light flickers indefinitely.\nAfter the three balls are loaded, the right-most display shows \"READY\", \"SET\",\nand \"GO\" with the red, yellow, and green lights lit respectively for each\nstage.  The duration of the red and yellow lights are identical, although it\nvaries between Heats; the entire sequence can range from about 3/4 second to\n3 seconds.  After the Starting Countdown begins, the Starting Gate is lowered\nwhen \"GO\" appears or a green button is pressed, whichever comes first.  The\nplayer gets a bonus when the green button is pressed while \"GO\" is lit;\npressing it at the exact time \"GO\" goes on scores a hole shot (the back display\nsays \"HOLSHOT\" of 250K and automatically completes the flashing Section.\nPressing slightly later gives scores ranging from 100k to 30k (perhaps lower),\ndepending on the reaction time, the quicker the better.  Pressing early (during\nthe red or yellow lights) results in a \"TOO EARLY FOR BONUS\" message and no\npoints.  Paradoxically, it seems easier to get a Holshot with a fast countdown\nthan it is with a slow one.\n\nLaps\n\nThe object of the game is to finish three laps of eight Sections each.\nFinishing a lap allows one to attempt a Special Test.  I don't know what\nhappens when three laps are finished; I've only been able to finish one.  Each\nfinished lap is indicated by a white light in the lower playfield right above\nthe lower flippers.\n\nSections\n\nCompleting all eight Sections finishes a lap.  In the center of Lower Playfield\nis a ring of eight lights corresponding to the eight Sections.  They are\nlabeled, counter-clockwise from upper left, \"DOWNHILL!\", \"BOG!\", \"HILL CLIMB!\",\n\"RAPIDS!\", \"HWY 93!\", \"SWAMP!\", \"ROCKS!\", and \"CLIFF HANGER!\", corresponding to\nthe Downhill Section, Bog Section, Hill Climb Section, Rapids Section, Hwy 93\nSection, Swamp Section, Rocks Section, and Cliff Hanger Section, respectively.\nThe progress towards Sections are not reset after each Heat.\n\nThe Flashing Section\n\nExcept during completion of a lap or in the middle of the Special task, one\nlight in the ring is flashing (called the Flashing Section), and each of the\nother lights is either unlit, or steady.  A steady light means that the Section\nis completed.  The corresponding unclaimed targets in the Flashing section also\nstart flashing.\n\nPressing the left green button moves the Flashing Section counter-clockwise to\nthe next incomplete Section, and pressing the right green button moves the\nFlashing Section clockwise to the next incomplete Section, except during the\nbonus count, a tilt warning, or a tilt.  (Note that this does not exclude\nloading the Starting Gate, or even dropping the Starting Gate during the\nStarting Countdown.)\n\nMaking progress or completing a Flashing Section generally scores twice as many\npoints than if the Section was not the Flashing Section.  If the Flashing\nSection is completed, the next goal in counter-clockwise order becomes the next\nFlashing Section.  Also, besides the light in the ring flashing, the actual\ntarget lights corresponding to the Flashing Section that are not already lit\nwill flash as well.\n\nAfter each Heat, the Flashing Section is reset to the Downhill Section, or the\nnext incompleted goal clockwise of it.\n\nThere are two ways of completing the Flashing Section without actually hitting\nthe necessary targets for it:\n\n Making a Holshot during the Starting Countdown; and\n Making a successful Fast Line! shot.\n\n\nThe Swamp\n\nA few things about the Swamp target should be mentioned:\n\nTo finish the Swamp Section, the player must hit 5 targets five times, for 25\nhits total.  Every time all the targets are hit down, the player scores 25K,\na Swamp light goes one steady, and the next light to be collected starts\nflashing.  When the Flashing Target is the Swamp, it flashes at a higher\nrate.\n\nAlthough the targets pop up after each heat, the number of previous hits *is*\nremembered, so if you lost one heat with only one Swamp target up, you only\nneed to hit one more target next heat to get a Swamp Light.\n\nBonus Multipliers\n\nTriggering an Upper Loop lights the loop on the other side for a short time.\nScoring a lit Upper Loop (Left or Right) nets 100K and advances the Bonus\nMultiplier, which can go up to 4x.\n\nSpecial\n\nShooting the Upper Loops alternating Left and Right rapidly for 5 times lights\nthe Special (a free game) in the inlanes.\n\nScoring Sections\n\n\nDescriptionUnlitFlashingSteady\nCompleting a Section50K100KN/A\nEach Rapids Target2K5K2K\nHill Climb Section25K50K25K\nEach Bog Target2K5K2K\nDownhill Section50K100K50K\nCliff Hanger Section25K50K25K\nEach Rocks Target2K5K2K\nEach Swamp Target2K5K2K\nEvery 5 Targets25K25K25K\nHwy 93 Section25K50K25K\n\n\nNote that completing a section is separate from the actual hit, so going\nthrough Hwy 93 when it is unlit gets 25K+50K = 75K points.\n\nThe minimal number of points for finishing the course is then 720K, and can go\nas high as 1475K if the Flashing Section is used wisely.  This is not counting\nextra bonuses and hits of flashing targets, of course.\n\nSpecial Test\n\nAfter finishing all goals in a lap, the music changes, the goal lights start\nflashing in a pattern, and the player has to try a special task.  [I suspect\nsomething is wrong with this on my machine.] First, the player must drain all\nbut one ball in this heat.  An unlimited amount of time is given for the player\nto shoot the remaining ball to the Upper Saucer.  During this time, all targets\nadd to the Special Bonus, which starts at 1M.\n\nAfter shooting into the Upper Saucer, the music changes, the goal lights flash\nin another pattern, and the Upper Saucer ejects the ball.  The player has 25(?)\nseconds to shoot the Downhill Ramp, and then take the right exit to the Lower\nSaucer.  Doing so scores the Special Bonus and lights the Special.\n\nThe Special Test is ended when:\n\n It is completed; OR\n the 25-second countdown expires; OR\n the ball drains.\n\n\nThe Lower Loop and Save-It!s\n\nHitting the ball through the Lower Loop in one direction the first time scores\n5K, and subsequent shots through the Lower Loop in that same direction will\nscore 10K, then 25K, then 50K and a Save-It!, at which point a next shot scores\n10K, and the cycle repeats.  Shooting a ball through in the other direction\nstacks in the same way, and does not cancel progress on the other side.  It is\npossible for both outlanes to be lit with Save-It!s.\n\nThe series is reset after each Heat.\n\nPressing either green button switches the two directions.  Hence, a skilled\nplayer could potentially get a Save-It! earlier by hitting a green button if\nthe ball is not on the correct side.\n\nLighting a Save-It! lights a flashing orange light on one of the outlanes.\nPressing either green button switches the light to the other outlane.  This is\nthe equivalent of an extra ball; if a ball rolls down an outlane that has\nSave-It! lit, the Save-It! light next to the right flipper goes on, and the\nplayer gets to shoot another ball into play after all balls this heat are\ndrained.  This extra ball does not enter a Starting Countdown.\n\nIf a Save-It! is not collected, it stays lit until the game is over.\n\nBall Holds\n\nBall Holds function like the \"Lock\"s in typical pinball machines.\nIf there is more than 1 ball in play, the Saucers function as Ball Holds:\n\nAn empty saucer will have its \"HOLD\" light flashing.  When a ball gets caught\nin the saucer, the HOLD light will go out, the player will get (?) points,\nand the ball will be held.\nWhen a ball has been held for (?) seconds, the saucer will \"rev up\" (nice\nsound effect), the HOLD light will start flashing, and the saucer will\neject the ball.\nWhen only two balls are in play and both are in saucers, the one that was\ncaught less recently will \"rev up\" and eject, even if (?) seconds have\nnot passed yet.\n\n\nIf there is only one ball left in play:\n\nIf it is in a saucer, the saucer will \"rev up\" and eject the ball.\nIf it enters a saucer, the saucer will \"rev up\" and eject the ball, but\nthe 25K light in front of the saucer will go on, and all subsequent\ncaptures by the saucer with that ball will be worth 25K.\n\n\nApparently some later versions do not have the ball \"revving up\"; certain\npeople started thinking that it was a malfunction.\n\nEnd-of-Ball Bonus\n\nThe Bonus is rather straightforward.\n\n\n Each Lap scores 100K.\n Each completed Section Scores 10K.\n Each target in a partially complete Section scores 2K.\n The entire sum is then multiplied by the Bonus Multiplier.\n The resulting sum is the bonus.\n If there is a playfield multiplier, the bonus is scored that many times into the\nscore.\n\nReplays\n\nReplays are awarded for each of the following:\n\n\n Getting a Special\n Finishing the Special Task\n Beating a self-adjusting score of about 1.1M\n Beating 2M (operator adjustable)\n Beating the high score\n\nBall Savers\n\nNone known.  However, sometimes if too many balls were drained together, the\ndrain would choke and throw one ball back into play.\n\nMiscellaneous Scoring\n\nMore Info needed.\n\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\n\nInstead of flipping wildly with the upper flippers, try catching balls.  It can\nbe done, and it's easier than you might expect.\n\nI usually find Cliff Hanger and Hwy 93 the hardest Sections, since the flippers\non my machine are weak and both of these shots are impossible from a held ball.\nWhen I begin I make Cliff Hanger the Flashing Section before I load the balls,\nand I attempt the Hotshot with the left green button.  This has the effect of\nimmediately making Downhill the Flashing Section whether I make the Potshot or\nnot, and it's a good shot from the upper right flipper.\n\nIn general, take advantage of lulls to move the Flashing Section to what you're\nmost likely to get next.  In the Lower Playfield, I usually try\n\n Rapids\n Hill Climb\n Swamp\n Hwy 93\n\nIn the Upper Playfield, I try\n\n Bog\n Hill Climb\n Rocks\n Cliff Hanger\n\nalthough usually I have time to catch the ball and select the one on the\ncorrect side.\n\nWhen the ball is in the lower playfield, keep the Flashing Target on Rapids.\nWhenever you try to make a Hill Climb shot with the right flipper, hit both\nwhite and green buttons on that side to more the Flashing Target to Hill Climb\nright before it is claimed.\n\nTry to get into the saucers often.  That way, you'll have fewer balls to\ncontend with -- for a while.\n\nA skilled player should never lose balls down outlanes, especially the left\none.\n\nTry very hard to get the Bonus Multipliers.  If you can get them\nconsistently, the 2M replay should be accessible every time.\n\nTrick Shots\n\nNone known.\n\nKnown Bugs\n\nThere are no ball searches.\n\nThis was one of the earliest games to use opto sensors, and it uses them on\nonly one place: the ball trough.  Therefore, the game has an annoying tendency\nto not know where the balls are.  What would happen is:\n\n\n Two balls get sent in front of the plunger.  It takes good skill and timing\nto get the balls up to the Starting Gate, the reward of which is usually one\nball up to the Starting Gate will start the countdown, leaving one ball still\nat the plunger and only two balls in play, a much more controllable situation.\n\n All the balls would drain, but the CPU would think that balls were still\nout there.  Even tilting the machine doesn't help in this situation; it must be\nturned off and on again.\n\n\n\nSometimes if too many balls were drained together, the drain would choke and\nthrow one ball back into play.\n\nCheats\n\nSometimes the Starting Gate will drop and only one or two balls start to roll.\nIf that happens, be happy; you'll have less balls to control, and you can\neasily knock the extra ball into play later.  Just be patient when all balls\nare locked in saucers.  This also happens when two balls get sent in front of\nthe plunger and you only put one through.\n\nDeath Saves and Bang Backs\n\nI've never done any, but the low degree of visibility makes me think that they\nare probably difficult on this machine.  Also, since the drain is on the left\nside, Death Saves are probably completely impossible since the space underneath\nthe left flipper is barely large enough to fit the ball!\n\nTournament Mode\n\nMore Info Needed.\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nNone known.\n\nMusic\n\nMostly banjo bluegrass music.  You might like it; you might find it really\nannoying.\n\nSounds\n\n\n \"Yee-hah!\": Registering Hwy 93\n \"Woo-hah!\": Registering Hill Climb\n Motorcycle speeding: Going through Lower Loop\n Motorcycle getting ready: Starting Countdown\n Motorcycle revving up: right before Saucer Ejection\n\nStats\n\nBlackwater 100\nBally Manufacturing Corporation, March 1988, 4 players\n\n\nTheme: Sports - Motorcycles/Motocross\nDesign: Dennis Nordman\nArt: Tony Ramunni\nProgram: Gary Oglesby\nSounds: Neil Falconer\nSpecial Thanks: Dave and Rita Coombs\n\n\nManual #:0365-00H07-1001 for game 0H07\n\n[Bally was sold to Williams in July 1988, making this the last \"true\" Bally\npinball game.]\n\nUnconfirmed Rumors\n\nA very low production run.

The author disclaims all interest in any trademarks\nor other intellectual property referenced herein.\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nDescribed from the flippers, and going around the playfield clockwise.\n\nFlippers\nThere are two. Normal configuration, normal placement.\nLeft Inlane\nNormal left in lane. Scores 5000. Ball feeds to the left flipper.\nLeft Outlane\nNormal left outlane. Scores 10,000 and advances bonus. Can\nbe lit for Special. If lit for Special, does not advance\nbonus.\nLeft Slingshot\nNormal slignshot.\n7 Target\nA round standup target, part of the 1...8 sequence of targets. Scores 1000.\nLeft Double Bonus Lane\nA small lane next to the Left Spinner. Scores 10,000 and advances the bonus.\nCan be lit to lite Double Bonus. \nLeft Spinner\nA spinner with a tickertape machine on one side, and a red swirly on the\nother. Scores 100, or 1000 when lit.\n1 Target\nA round standup target, part of the 1...8 sequence of targets. Scores 1000.\n2 Target\nA round standup target, part of the 1...8 sequence of targets. Scores 1000.\nLeft Pop Bumper\nA standard pop bumper. Scores 10, or 100 when lit. \nTop Saucer\nA saucer that the ball can land in when in the upper arch area, or via\na bounce from the Pop bumpers. Scores 5000 and advances the bonus two\npositions (10,000 points). Kicks out so that the ball hits the Left Pop Bumper. \nRight Pop Bumper\nA standard pop bumper. Scores 10, or 100 when lit. \n3 Target\nA round standup target, part of the 1...8 sequence of targets. Scores 1000.\nRight Eject Hole\nA saucer with plastic guide on three sides (open at the bottom). This can\nbe hit, with difficulty, from the left flipper, through the spinner, but\nit is much more likely that a ball bouncing off the Right Pop Bumper will\nland here. Scores 5000 or 50,000 when lit, advances bonus one position\n(5000 points). If 1...8 sequence of targets is made, is lit for Special. Once lit, it remains lit for the remainder of\nthe game.\nRight Spinner\nA companion spinner to the Left Spinner with a tickertape machine on one\nside, and a red swirly on the other. Scores 100, or 1000 when lit.\nRight Double Bonus Lane\nA small lane next to the Right Spinner. Scores 10,000 and advances the bonus.\nCan be lit to lite Double Bonus.\n8 Target\nA round standup target, part of the 1...8 sequence of targets. Scores 1000.\nRight Slingshot\nNormal slignshot.\nRight Outlane\nNormal right outlane. Scores 10,000 and advances bonus. Can be lit for\nSpecial. If lit for Special, does not advance bonus.\nRight Inlane\nNormal right in lane. Scores 5000. Ball feeds to the right flipper.\n4 Target\nA round standup target in the center area of the playfield, part of the\n1...8 sequence of targets.  Scores 1000, or 10,000 and advances bonus when\nlit.\n5 Target\nA round standup target in the center area of the playfield, part of the\n1...8 sequence of targets.  Scores 1000, or 10,000 and advances bonus when\nlit.\n6 Target\nA round standup target in the center area of the playfield, part of the\n1...8 sequence of targets.  Scores 1000, or 10,000 and advances bonus when\nlit.\nDouble Bonus Lite\nBetween the flippers. When lit, the Bonus collected at the end of the\nball will be doubled.\nBonus Lites\nIn the lower center of the playfield is a V shaped series of lites,\nstarting at 5000 and going up to 50,000, denoting the current bonus to\nbe collected at the end of the ball. Targets that advance the bonus advance\nthese lites. Bonus score can be doubled by liting and hitting the\nleft or right\nDouble Bonus lanes.\nManual Plunger\n This is a normal plunger.  Its lane leads to the top arch.\n\n\nRules\n\nSkill shot\nThere isn't one, though getting the ball in the saucer for 5000 points,\nplus 10,000 in bonus, is worth a lot more than the 10-point switches on\neither side of it.\n\n1...8 Targets\nThese are the primary \"objective\" of the game. There are eight numbered\nstandup targets around the playfield. Completing a series of them does\nsomething. The series are:\n\n 1 2 3 - Lites Right Eject Hole for 50,000 points.\n 1 and 4 - Lites left Double Bonus lane.\n 3 and 6 - Lites right Double Bonus lane.\n 2 - Lites Left Spinner\n 5 - Lites Right Spinner\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 - Lites outlanes (alternating)\nfor Special (Operator adjustable - see below).\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 - Lites Right Eject Hole for\nSpecial.\n 4 5 6 - Lites 4, 5, and 6 targets for 10,000 and advance bonus per hit. \n\nStrategy\n\nHit the standup targets to lite everything as soon as possible. Nail the\nspinners for lots of points, and for the ball bouncing around in the upper\nplayfield, which will usually pick up the 1, 2, and 3 targets, and maybe a\nsaucer or two. Be careful with the 4, 5, and 6\ntargets, since they are right above the drain. The 7 and 8 targets are\nalmost impossible to shoot directly, and are drain targets for the\noutlanes; let random bouncing take care of these two. The Right Eject Hole is almost impossible to hit\ndirectly, since neither flipper has a clear shot at it.\nOperator Adjustments\n\nBeing an electromechanical game, Blue Chip has several adjustment plugs\nthat the operator can use to tune the game play to the location. The\noptions are:\n\nGameplay\n\n3 balls per game or 5 balls per game.\n Special - Conservative (Outlanes lit for special\nwhen 1...8 targets are completed or Liberal (Outlanes lit when 1...6\ntargets are completed).\nSpecial\n\nSpecial options are Replay, Extra Ball (Add A Ball), or Novelty\n(points). Blue Chip is a true Add A Ball game, complete with balls to play\nlights 1 ... 10 behind the backglass.\n\nEarnings\n\nEnd of game Match can be enabled or disabled.\n Tilt Penalty can be set for Ball in Play or Game\n Pricing - how many coins and how many credits per coin(s). Oddly, the\nway the Credit Unit is configured, the switch that controls the coin door\nlockout coil is mounted on the zero position switch stack, so if there are\nany credits on the wheel, the coin slots are disabled. It is possible to\nset the game up for 2-coins for 3-plays, but it is done by having the first\ncoin start a game immediately, and the second coin adds two credits on the\nCredit Unit.\nSettings\n\nI shopped out a Blue Chip for a friend. Here are the settings I used:\n\nSpecials @ 170,000 and 290,000\nSpecial = Extra Ball (Add a Ball)\nMatch disabled\n5 Balls per game\nSpecial Adjust = Liberal\nTilt Penalty = Ball in play\nPricing = 1 quarter / 1 play\n\n\nI also set the game up for free play by bending the zero position switch on\nthe Credit Unit to be permanently closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Blue Chip", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/bluechip.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Blue Chip", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

They own all the rights to the stuff, I\n          don't.\n\n   Designer\n          Greg Kmiec, who worked at Bally during the 70's and 80's.\n          Breakshot bears a few similarities to Kmiec's popular \"Captain\n          Fantastic.\"\n\n   Artwork\n          Stan Fukuoka\n\nIntroduction\n\n   Breakshot was released in May 1996 by the ex-pinball company Capcom\n   Coin-Op, Inc. Significantly lower-priced than its contemporaries, it\n   has the look and feel of a 70's style pinball machine -- but the\n   gameplay is quite modern. Your score is displayed on the DMD, but the\n   game often shows it as if they were old EM scoring reels, even\n   simlating the lag delay. (By the way, although there are only seven\n   digits in the reel, scores higher than 10M are shown as numbers \"over\n   the top.\")\n\nTheme\n\n   The theme of the game is that of a pool hall. You complete pool games\n   over and over until you get tired. The four main games are:\n\n     * Eight Ball;\n     * Nine Ball;\n     * Rotation; and\n     * Cutthroat Countdown.\n\n   The rules for these games are similar to the actual games in pool;\n   winning the games are achieved by \"sinking balls.\" (No, draining the\n   pinball is still bad.) Cutthroat Countdown is quite lucrative and can\n   be considered the \"wizard mode\" of the machine -- if you can get to\n   it, you've had a pretty good game.\n\nPlayfield\n\n   We'll start at the bottom and going in an approximately clockwise\n   fashion, saving the middle \"island\" of stuff for last:\n\n   Drain\n          Like most other drains. A ball-saver is lit here at the start\n          of each ball for a few seconds. If the ball-saver has run out\n          and the last ball on the playfield enters the drain without\n          hitting an outlane switch, a \"Bad Shot\" is registered, with an\n          appropriate animation on the DMD. [In pool, a \"Bad Shot\" is a\n          shot which does not sink any balls and usually results in a\n          loss of turn.] According to an indication on the playfield,\n          hitting the drain collects bonus; according to me, this does,\n          in fact, happen.\n\n   Center Post\n          Haven't seen one of these since Gottlieb folded. (No, I haven't\n          seen X-Files yet. Shush.) There is a rubber-lined post between\n          the flippers that can stop STDM balls and embarrass the player.\n\n   Flippers\n          It might be worth noting that although the playfield is rather\n          like an old EM, these flippers are modern flippers that propel\n          the ball quite a ways.\n\n   Slingshots\n          Each time a slingshot is hit the player gets 10 points or 1K\n          points. Which one is decided by the Williams/Bally method.\n\n   Left Inlane\n          Scores 3K. Usually (apparently when Collect Bonus is not lit)\n          lights the 8-ball saucer for Call Your Shot, which times out\n          pretty quickly.\n\n   Left Outlane\n          Usually sends the ball to the drain and registers for a\n          \"Scratch.\" [In pool, a \"Scratch\" is sinking the cue ball into a\n          pocket, usually resulting in a loss of turn.] A \"Scratch\" is\n          worth 30K. The outlane can be lit for a kickback, called a\n          \"Kicker,\" that sends the ball back into play; what lights the\n          Kicker has been a source of speculation (see Kicker, below).\n\n   \"Green\" Targets\n          These are three white drop targets with a yellow stand-up\n          target behind the middle one. The drop targets reset every\n          ball; hitting each one is worth 3K points. When all three drop\n          targets are down, the stand-up target can be hit. When this\n          process (hitting all drop targets and then the stand-up) can\n          \"sink a ball,\" the appropriate light in front of the targets is\n          lit steady (when not all the drop targets are down) or flashing\n          (when all the drop targets are down and the stand-up can be\n          hit). During Nine Ball, the light is the square yellow \"Spots 9\n          Ball\" light; during the other two games, it is either the\n          6-ball or the 14-ball. [These two balls are colored green in\n          actual pool.] The stand-up target scores 3K points if it isn't\n          lit for anything else.\n\n   Left Orbit\n          Usually sends the ball to the rollovers; is sometimes lit for a\n          Super Cue (by the \"Orange\" Target), in which case the ball goes\n          all the way around to the Right Orbit. A successful Left Orbit\n          shot spots a ball in 9-ball (in addition to any balls that\n          might be spotted by Super Cue). See more on Super Cue later in\n          the Scoring Section. An unlit orbit shot is 3K points.\n\n   Captive Balls\n          Unlike most captive balls, this is a two-ball system similar to\n          the Tiger Saw ball in Theatre of Magic; the lower ball can be\n          hit from many directions, A weak shot will trigger an internal\n          rollover (worth 3K points), but a strong shot will hit an\n          internal target (which adds an additional 30K to the 3K). Only\n          the internal target counts as a \"real\" hit. Registering a hit\n          shows an animation of The Moose getting hit by a ball. Hitting\n          the captive ball will light up the green lights to the right of\n          the captive ball; when all green lights are lit, the captive\n          ball can be hit for an extra ball. On default settings this\n          takes four hits, but the operator can change this number. The\n          operator can also decide whether or not progress is stored\n          between balls (default is yes), and decide how many balls can\n          be stacked each game (default is only one).\n\n   Jet Bumpers\n          There are three of these arranged in an inverted triangle below\n          the rollover lanes. The points earned for each Jet Bumper hit\n          cycles between 1,000, 1,010, and 1,020.\n\n   Rollover Lanes\n          There are three rollover lanes: \"Yellow\" (1-ball and 9-ball),\n          \"Blue\" (2-ball and 10-ball), and \"Red\" (3-ball and 11-ball).\n          During Eight Ball and Rotation, each corresponding rollover\n          lane \"sinks\" the appropriate ball. In addition, the rollover\n          lanes have lights with the shape of a diamond on it that behave\n          like typical bonus multiplier rollovers. The flippers do not\n          cycle the ball rollover light but do cycle the bonus multiplier\n          rollovers; this behavior can be changed by the operator. A\n          rollover that doesn't sink a ball awards 3K.\n\n   Bank Shot Lane\n          A small orbit with an optical sensor. If lit, scores a \"bank\n          shot,\" which usually \"sinks\" the next ball (see the Bank Shot\n          section later in this rulesheet). It's pretty hard to hit this\n          lane with anything except the upper-right flipper.\n\n   \"Brown\" Targets\n          Another set of three drop targets and a standup that function\n          exactly like the \"Green\" Targets, except that this set scores\n          for the 7-ball and 15-ball (colored brown in normal pool) when\n          appropriate.\n\n   Right Orbit\n          Usually sends the ball to the rollovers; is sometimes lit for a\n          Super Cue (by the \"Purple\" Target), in which case the ball goes\n          all the way around to the Right Orbit. See more on Super Cue\n          later in the Scoring Section. This lane is sometimes easier to\n          score by a backhand from the upper right flipper. If unlit,\n          scores 3K points.\n\n   Upper Right Flipper\n          A short-length flipper that can be used to score the Bank Shot\n          lane. Also can score the \"Brown\" Targets, the Right Orbit (by a\n          backhand), and the Jet Bumpers. It's worth nothing that this\n          flipper can actually catch the ball, unlike many Lawlor games\n          with a small flipper.\n\n   8-Ball Saucer\n          This saucer will score the 8-ball when possible. Can also be\n          lit for Call Your Shot (after the left inlane), Collect Bonus,\n          Ball-O-Rama, or certain combinations of the above. When nothing\n          is lit, scores 10K.\n\n   Plunger\n          A manual plunger. A weak shot will send the ball to the upper\n          right flipper (lighting the Skill Shot); a strong shot will\n          send the ball to the rollovers or score a Right Super Cue when\n          lit.\n\n   Right Outlane\n          Like the left outlane, scores a \"Scratch\" worth 30K; unlike the\n          left outlane, cannot be lit for a ball-saver.\n\n   Right Inlane\n          Scores a whopping 3,000 points.\n\n   \"Purple\" Target\n          A target to the left of the central island. Scores the 4-ball\n          or 12-ball when lit; otherwise scores 3K. When the purple light\n          is flashing, a hit lights the right Super Cue.\n\n   \"Orange\" Target\n          A target to the right of the central island. Scores the 5-ball\n          or 13-ball when lit; otherwise scores 3K. When the purple light\n          is flashing, a hit lights the left Super Cue.\n\n   Center Pockets Area\n          Finally, the main feature of this machine. The front of this\n          contraption has an optical sensor and a round post that can\n          rise up and block balls from going in or out. Inside, there are\n          three saucers that can capture balls and eject them as desired.\n          There is also an opto that senses when a ball has just crossed\n          the entrance and/or is leaning on a raised post. When one or\n          two balls are resting on a raised post, the contraption acts\n          like a captive ball; a sufficiently hard hit on the post will\n          propell the balls into the side pockets.\n\nGames\n\n   There are three games, all of whose purpose is to be sinking balls.\n   \"Sinking\" each ball in each game awards 30K or 31K, with the exception\n   of Cutthroat Countdown. When each game starts, all the drop targets\n   are thrown back up. The current game will be indicated by a flashing\n   light on the playfield:\n\n     * During Eight Ball, the chalk above the left slingshot will be\n       flashing;\n     * during Nine Ball, the 9-ball in the center above the word\n       \"Breakshot\" will be flashing;\n     * during Rotation, the chalk above the right slingshot will be\n       flashing.\n\n   Completed games will have a steady light. On default settings,\n   completing all three games leads to Cutthroat Countdown, but this\n   number can be changed. Another Cutthroat Countdown will begin after\n   the completion of each subsequent game, which is picked in a fixed\n   order (Nine Ball, Eight Ball, Nine Ball, Rotation).\n\n   The balls you have sunk will be displayed by the lights on the\n   playfield right above the flippers, as well as on the DMD when you\n   have just sunk a ball.\n\n   The rules for the games in detail:\n\n  Eight Ball\n\n   Like the real game of Eight Ball, in Eight Ball you have to sink eight\n   different balls -- the seven \"solids\" (1 to 7) or the seven \"stripes\"\n   (9 to 15) in any order, followed by the black 8-ball. In real pool,\n   the first ball sunk by any player determines whether that player is\n   trying to sink the solids or the stripes; in Breakshot, the game\n   chooses which set you are going for using some esoteric random\n   decision awfully similar to the way Bally/Williams decides if their\n   next machine is going to be a Bally or a Williams. Don't worry; the\n   seven targets are the same. You have to hit one of each of the seven\n   \"colors\":\n\n     * \"Yellow\": The left rollover lane.\n     * \"Blue\": The center rollover lane.\n     * \"Red\": The right rollover lane.\n     * \"Purple\": The standup to the left of the Breakshot Area entrance.\n     * \"Orange\": The standup to the right of the Breakshot Area entrance.\n     * \"Green\": The row of drop targets and standup on the left side of\n       the playfield.\n     * \"Brown\": The row of drop targets and standup on the upper right of\n       the playfield.\n\n   After \"sinking\" all seven of these balls (in any order), shoot the\n   8-ball hole (on the right side of the playfield) to finish the game.\n   Fortunately, sinking the 8-ball before you sink the other seven balls\n   does not automatically make you lose the game, as it does in actual\n   Eight Ball. One interesting feature is kept -- when the 8-ball is lit,\n   Call Your Shot is also lit. Presumably the original idea was to have\n   the game be like regular eight ball, where the player not only has to\n   sink the 8-ball but call the pocket it sinks in -- fortunately, you\n   don't have to do that. Rather, hitting the 8-ball saucer sinks the\n   8-ball, finishing Eight Ball, and then Call Your Shot allows you to\n   finish the next game (usually Nine Ball) almost immediately.\n\n   Finishing Eight Ball scores 100K points.\n\n  Nine Ball\n\n   In the actual game of Nine Ball, the purpose of the game is to sink\n   the balls from 1 through 9 in order. Fortunately, in the Breakshot\n   variation, you need only to hit certain targets to sink the \"next\"\n   ball. They are:\n\n     * The Left Loop\n     * The Captive Ball stand-up target (The \"Sink 9 Ball\" light on the\n       Left Loop is actually for this!)\n     * The Right Loop\n     * The \"Green\" stand-up target\n     * The \"Brown\" stand-up target\n\n   It is usually necessary to shoot the drop targets to get to the\n   stand-up targets. Each one of these will score the next ball in Nine\n   Ball. Hit them nine times to finish the game.\n\n   Getting the ball past the Center Pocket entrance opto during Nine Ball\n   scores the Nine Ball Bonus, which is determined by the triangular\n   light lit right underneath the Center Pockets, which is one of\n\n     * \"Points\" (200K points times the number of times this has been\n       collected or 250K, I dunno)\n     * \"Special\" (Usually a free game)\n     * \"Extra Ball\" (Duhhh, I dunno...)\n\n   The Nine Ball Bonus can only be collected once each game of Nine Ball.\n   The Bonus alternates every seven seconds between \"Points\" and \"Extra\n   Ball\"; however, if no target is hit for seven seconds, it \"freezes\" on\n   \"Points\" (this is so that a player can't hold a ball and wait for the\n   Extra Ball). During (and only during) the second game of Nine Ball,\n   The \"Special\" also appears in the sequence. The operator can change\n   the round the Special appears, or not at all. The Special can only be\n   collected once each game.\n\n   The operator can adjust the settings so that the player cannot collect\n   the same Nine Ball Bonus in two consecutive Nine Ball games.\n\n   If Nine Ball is finished by choosing the Center Pockets during Call\n   Your Shot (and succeeding) immediately after Eight Ball, the Nine Ball\n   Bonus is always \"Points.\"\n\n   Nine Ball scores 200K points when finished.\n\n  Rotation\n\n   In this game, you must sink all the balls in order from 1 through 15.\n   Otherwise, the targets are basically the same as Eight Ball.\n\n   Finishing Rotation scores 500K.\n\n  \"Sink Next Ball\" shots\n\n   Certain shots will automatically sink the lowest-numbered ball that\n   you can sink. They are:\n\n     * The Super Cues (see below);\n     * The saucers in the Center Pockets Area. If the kickout from the\n       saucers is too hard, the ball will often bounce into another\n       saucer, sinking another ball again and again (this is good) until\n       the machine decides a saucer sensor must be broken and ignores it\n       (this is bad).\n\n   These shots are often easier than the actual targets you need to hit.\n\n   In addition, increasing the bonus multiplier by the rollovers sink the\n   lowest-numbered yellow, blue, or red ball. (That is, the balls that\n   can be scored by the rollovers.)\n\nGame Features and Modes\n\n  Tilt\n\n   The player gets two tilt warnings by default. If the machine is tilted\n   too many times, the DMD shows an interesting animation of a female\n   falling off a pool table. The operator may decide to disable the tilt\n   when the ball is hitting the pop bumpers, in case your machine has\n   those really energetic pop bumpers ...\n\n  Ball Saver\n\n   At the start of each ball, a Ball Saver is lit for 8 seconds. In\n   addition, a Ball Saver is also lit (for 8 seconds) when a ball is\n   ejected from the 8-ball Saucer. The operator may turn either or both\n   of these off.\n\n  Center Pockets\n\n   The main feature of this pin, the Center Pockets will often give the\n   player progress in the individual games, as well as allow the player\n   to play multiball, known in this pin as Ball-O-Rama (a 2-ball\n   multiball, see below) or Breakshot Frenzy (a 3-ball multiball, see\n   below). Like most games with multiball, the player is required to\n   light locks, lock balls, and start multiball. The logistics of this\n   area are a bit confusing, so listen up:\n\n   First, there are these yellow pointer lights that point to the\n   saucers. These lights correspond to the side saucers and are either\n   unlit (lock is unlit and can be lit), flashing (lock is lit), or\n   steady (a ball is locked).\n\n   To light a lock, the ball must land in a saucer (either the center\n   saucer or an unlit side saucer) and not bounce out immediately. To\n   lock a ball, the ball must first be resting against a raised center\n   post and then land in a pocket that is lit for a lock.\n\n   There are three progressively difficult stages that govern how the\n   locks are lit. In the first stage, the locks start out lit and do not\n   have to be lit. In the second stage, the locks start out unlit, but\n   any successful saucer hit will light both locks. In the third stage, a\n   saucer hit will only light one lock, and another (non-locking) saucer\n   hit is required to light the other lock.\n\n   If the post is down, any ball that enters the Center Pockets area will\n   trigger the optical sensors at the mouth of the area, raise the post,\n   and another ball will be ejected to the plunger trough -- unless there\n   are already two balls locked in the Center Pockets area, in which case\n   there is no ball to eject to the plunger trough and the post will not\n   go up immediately. (It will go up eventually if the ball lands in the\n   center unoccupied saucer and stays there, since this is what starts\n   Breakshot Frenzy.)\n\n   If the post is up, there will be one or two balls lying next to it. A\n   good hit on the post will propel those balls into pockets, which may\n   or may not be occupied or lit for locks. The post will then lower if\n   and only if all balls in the area were resting on the post and all of\n   them were just locked; otherwise, the machine will eject all the balls\n   that are being held in pockets to lie against the post.\n\n   The post is down and the area is empty at the start of each game. In a\n   one-player game, the state of the Center Pockets does not change from\n   ball to ball; in a multi-player game, the game will sometimes raise\n   the post and eject all balls stuck in saucers prior to each player's\n   turn (unless, of course, there are no balls in the area). Also, it is\n   suspected that the game may make locks harder to do in a multi-player\n   game. This area needs more research.\n\n   If a ball lands in a saucer that is lit for a lock and the post was\n   up, then the ball will be locked. In any other case where a ball lands\n   in a saucer, the ball will be ejected and ready to lie against a\n   raised post.\n\n   A successful saucer hit will generally \"sink\" a ball regardless of\n   whether that saucer is the center saucer, an unlit side saucer, or a\n   flashing a side saucer. (A steady-lit side saucer has a ball in it, so\n   it is presumably quite difficult to get another ball in that saucer.)\n   This will award the standard 30K or 31K for \"sinking\" a ball, along\n   with any other bonuses detailed in the next paragraph:\n\n   A \"Good Shot\" is when the ball is shot into any saucer when the post\n   is down (and less than two balls are locked). It does not award any\n   extra points aside from the standard 30K or 31K. A \"Trick Shot\" is\n   when one ball is shot into a side saucer when the post is up. It gives\n   100K extra points. A \"Nice Combo,\" aka \"Breakshot,\" is when two balls\n   are shot into both side saucers when the post is up. It awards 250K\n   extra points.\n\n   Ball-O-Rama is lit at the 8-Ball Saucer when and only when one ball is\n   locked; Breakshot Frenzy is lit at the center Center Pocket when and\n   only when two balls are locked.\n\n   The preceding paragraphs, while factually accurate, have no doubt\n   quite confused any reader as to what is going on. So, here is a sample\n   step-by-step scenario that might happen during the second stage:\n\n    1. At the start, neither lock is lit.\n    2. The player shoots a ball into the Center Pockets but fails to keep\n       the ball in a saucer.\n    3. The post rises up. The first ball lies against it.\n    4. A second ball is ejected to the plunger.\n    5. The game says, \"Go for the Trick Shot!\"\n    6. The player plays the second ball and hits the post, propelling the\n       first ball into a pocket.\n    7. The game says \"Trick Shot!\" and awards the player 100K + 31K and a\n       sunk ball.\n    8. The game lights the locks (both lights are now flashing).\n    9. The game ejects the first ball from the pocket. It lies against\n       the post.\n   10. The game says, \"Go for the Trick Shot ... one more time!\"\n   11. The player hits the post with the second ball again, propelling\n       the first ball into a pocket again.\n   12. The game says \"Trick Shot!\" and awards the player 100K + 30K and a\n       sunk ball.\n   13. The blinking light corresponding to the saucer the first ball\n       stayed in becomes steady.\n   14. The post goes down.\n   15. Ball-O-Rama is lit at the 8-ball saucer.\n   16. The player shoots the second ball into the center saucer; it stays\n       there.\n   17. The game says \"Good Shot\" and awards the player 30K and a sunk\n       ball.\n   18. The post rises up.\n   19. Ball-O-Rama is turned off.\n   20. A third ball is ejected to the plunger.\n   21. The first two balls are ejected from the saucers. Both lie next to\n       the post.\n   22. Both yellow lights are now flashing.\n   23. The player plays the third ball and hits the post so that only one\n       ball lands in a saucer.\n   24. The game says \"Trick Shot!,\" awards the player 100K + 31K, a sunk\n       ball, and ejects the ball so that it is lying next to the post\n       again.\n   25. The player hits the post again, this time hard enough so that both\n       balls land in saucers and stay there.\n   26. The game says \"Nice Combo!,\" awards the player 250K + 30K + 31K,\n       and two sunk balls.\n   27. The post goes down.\n   28. Both yellow lights are now steady.\n   29. The player hits the center pocket and the ball stays there.\n   30. Breakshot Frenzy starts.\n\n   When balls get ejected from the saucer to the post, the game does so\n   one ball at a time and gives the ball time to settle. This, combined\n   with the one-way flaps that lead to the side saucers, tend to ensure\n   that if two balls are lying against the post, they will be on\n   different sides. (The game cannot compensate for both balls being on\n   the same side, and subsequent goals will be rather difficult.) The\n   main drawback, however, is that this takes some time, and an impatient\n   player may already have the next ball in play and find himself or\n   herself unable to make a shot in the center.\n\n   Occasionally a ball will be ejected from the saucer and bounce into\n   another saucer. The game counts this as the other saucer being scored,\n   and player will get another ball sunk with a 30K or 31K bonus, but no\n   Trick Shot bonus. If this happens too many times in a row, the game\n   may decide that something is malfunctioning and refuse to eject any\n   more balls. The long-term effect of this is unknown.\n\n   The requirements for the locks in the Center Pockets to be lit depend\n   on how many times Breakshot Frenzy has occurred. The operator can set\n   the pockets on Easy, Normal, or Hard, which affect the stages in the\n   following way:\n\n     * Easy:\n          + Start of game: locks are automatically lit\n          + After Breakshot Frenzy has been played twice: both locks are\n            lit by one shot\n          + After Breakshot Frenzy has been played four times: each lock\n            must be individually lit\n     * Normal:\n          + Start of game: locks are automatically lit\n          + After Breakshot Frenzy has been played once: both locks are\n            lit by one shot\n          + After Breakshot Frenzy has been played three times: each lock\n            must be individually lit\n     * Hard:\n          + Always: each lock must be individually lit\n\n  Kicker\n\n   The Kicker will light if any set of drop targets has been dropped in\n   order (i.e., top-middle-down or down-middle-top). Kickers do do not\n   stack, but they can be set to stack by the operator. Partial progress\n   on the targets can be made while the Kicker is lit. The two sets of\n   drop targets do not affect each other; the player can drop some on one\n   set, then some on the other, then finish the first set (in order).\n\n   The Kicker is lit at the start of the first ball. The operator can\n   turn this off or give the player a Kicker at the start of every ball.\n\n   The operator can also decide whether or not the Kicker stays between\n   balls; the factory default is yes.\n\n  Super Cues\n\n   Hitting the \"Purple\" and \"Orange\" targets while the respective purple\n   lights are flashing will light the appropriate Super Cue. The target\n   on the left lights the Super Cue on the right, and vice versa. A ball\n   must go all past both rollover gates to count as a Super Cue -- a weak\n   ball that goes to the rollovers does not score the Super Cue.\n\n   The Super Cues cannot be stacked, since the purple lights go out if\n   the corresponding Super Cue is lit.\n\n   After each successful Super Cue collection, however, that Super Cue\n   light will begin flashing, and the player can score multiple\n   consecutive Super Cue shots on that Super Cue. Hitting any other\n   switch will turn it off. The Super Cues stay lit between balls, so\n   often a Right Super Cue will be scored by merely the plunger. Each\n   Super Cue scored sinks a ball and awards 60K times the number of\n   consecutive Super Cue shots just made (so, one is 60K, two is 120K,\n   etc.).\n\n   If both Super Cue shots are lit, shooting either one sinks two balls\n   (if balls can be sunk by Super Cues) but only scores as one Super Cue.\n\n   During Nine Ball, both Super Cue shots are lit all the time but only\n   sink one ball each.\n\n   If both Super Cue shots are lit, shooting one immediately after the\n   other lights the Captive Ball for an Extra Ball.\n\n   During Cutthroat Countdown, neither Super Cue can be lit, although if\n   one was lit when Cutthroat Countdown started, it will still be lit.\n\n  Bank Shot\n\n   Light the Bank Shot by shooting an unlit Bank Shot (worth 10 points).\n   The operator can set the machine so that any other target hit lights\n   the Bank Shot, or any other target except the \"Brown\" drop targets.\n   The last one is the default.\n\n   Hitting the Bank Shot when lit results in 100K points. It also makes\n   the Bank Shot flash for another consecutive Bank Shot, worth twice as\n   much. A third consecutive Bank Shot is worth three times as much, etc.\n\n   Shooting the Left Super Cue prior to the Bank Shot lights a Bank Shot\n   Bonus worth 50K, to be added to the actual Bank Shot points. Each Left\n   Super Cue shot after that for that ball doubles the Bank Shot Bonus;\n   Bank Shot Bonuses of 3.2M have been reported.\n\n   Hitting any other target after the Bank Shot is flashing turns off the\n   Bank Shot, except for the Brown targets (but the operator can decide\n   to let the Brown targets turn off the Bank Shot as well).\n\n   When a ball is initially plunged (and not, say, given due to a Center\n   Pocket shot) and is too weak to reach the rollovers, the Bank Shot is\n   lit for a Skill Shot worth 100K and a sunk ball.\n\n  Call Your Shot\n\n   Call Your Shot is lit by the left inlane (but only for a second or so)\n   and collected at the 8-ball saucer. Call Your Shot also stays lit\n   whenever the 8-ball is lit. When it is scored, the DMD cycles through\n   three choices:\n\n     * Center Pocket Area\n     * Left Super Cue\n     * Right Super Cue\n\n   After one is selected by hitting a flipper button, the game ejects the\n   ball from the 8-ball saucer. If the selected choice is hit within the\n   next second or two without hitting any other target, the current game\n   is automatically finished, with all rights and privileges awarded\n   therein. Unless the player is in Cutthroat Countdown, in which case\n   Call Your Shot awards a mere one million points (this can only happen\n   if the previous game was Eight Ball).\n\n  Collect Bonus\n\n   Collect Bonus is lit at the 8-ball saucer once at the beginning of\n   each ball. It means what it says -- you score your bonus. Each ball\n   sunk gives 10K in bonus, then each ball that was sunk at the start of\n   the ball gives another 10K in bonus. The total is then multiplied by\n   the bonus multiplier (scored by the rollover lights). The Bonus\n   Multiplier has been seen as high as 13x. Another way to collect bonus\n   is to hit the drain, but you don't want to do that.\n\n  Ball-O-Rama\n\n   When there is one captive ball in the Center Pocket Area, the 8-ball\n   saucer is lit for \"Ball-O-Rama.\" Both balls will eject, the Moose will\n   say \"Ball-O-Rama,\" and the game will go into a 2-ball multiball where\n   everything scores two times the normal score. The 8-ball saucer is lit\n   for a jackpot-like thing (the game doesn't call it anything, but the\n   moose does call it \"Bodacious!\"), which starts at 100K and climbs 10K\n   every second (although it will stop if no targets are being hit, to\n   avoid flipper catching). The jackpot does not reset after being\n   collected.\n\n  Breakshot Frenzy\n\n   When the third ball is captured in a Center Pocket Saucer, Breakshot\n   Frenzy begins. Breakshot Frenzy is a 3-ball multiball where all scores\n   are tripled, and the center Center Pocket is lit for an \"easy\"\n   jackpot, worth starting at 200K and increasing with time similar to\n   Ball-O-Rama, but erratically at a rate of 5K, sometimes every second,\n   sometimes every two seconds. The jackpot stays lit (but drops back to\n   200K after being collected) until a set number of \"easy\" jackpots have\n   been collected (default is 2). Once the player has run out of \"easy\"\n   jackpots, the jackpot can be relit again by shooting any Center\n   Pocket.\n\n   Once a jackpot is collected, the game raises the Center Pocket post to\n   make sure that no other balls get in. However, if the player manages\n   to get another ball in there, it will trigger the opto next to the\n   post and a \"Double Jackpot\" will be scored. A \"Triple Jackpot\" is not\n   possible; there's only one opto at the entrance. The DMD doesn't make\n   a very big deal about the double jackpot; perhaps it thinks that this\n   is \"dirty pool, old man\" and doesn't like it. :-)\n\n  Cutthroat Countdown\n\n   When a certain number of games are finished, Cutthroat Countdown\n   begins. There are four types of Cutthroat Countdown, which only differ\n   in terms of the balls you need to sink during Cutthroat Countdown:\n\n     * Eight Ball \"Solids\" Cutthroat Countdown (balls 1 through 8);\n     * Eight Ball \"Stripes\" Cutthroat Countdown (balls 9 through 15 and\n       then ball 8);\n     * Nine Ball Cutthroat Countdown (balls 1 through 9); and\n     * Rotation Cutthroat Countdown (balls 1 through 15).\n\n   The first, third, and every other Cutthroat Countdown is always Nine\n   Ball Cutthroat Countdown; the fourth, eighth, and every fourth\n   Cutthroat Countdown is always Rotation Cutthroat Countdown; the rest\n   (second, sixth, etc.) are Eight Ball Cutthroat Countdown. The\n   Cutthroat Countdown game determines what the player's next game, after\n   Cutthroat Countdown, is.\n\n   The \"Sink Next Ball\" shots, such as the Super Cues, no longer sink\n   balls.\n\n   The player is given 60 seconds while the game calls each ball, in\n   order, for no more than ten seconds. Hitting that ball's target sinks\n   that ball, scores one million (or more; see below) points, adds 10\n   seconds to the countdown timer, and forces the game to call the next\n   ball. For the Green and Brown balls, it is necessary to hit all three\n   drop targets but not necessarily the stand-up to sink the ball. If the\n   game has called each ball but there is still time left, the game gives\n   another 10 seconds per ball for the player to score the balls he\n   \"missed,\" this time in random order (although during Eight Ball\n   Cutthroat Countdown the 8-Ball is always called last). If at any point\n   all the balls (for that game) are sunk, the timer countdown\n   immediately ends.\n\n   If the player drains the ball while there is still time on the clock,\n   the next ball will still be the Cutthroat Countdown with the same time\n   left.\n\n   After the timer countdown ends, Cutthroat Countdown ends if the player\n   was incompetent enough to not sink any balls. Otherwise, all balls in\n   the Center Pockets are thrown out, and the center Center Pocket is lit\n   for a Super Jackpot worth 2 million (or more; see below) per ball sunk\n   during Cutthroat Countdown. Collecting the Super Jackpot ends\n   Cutthroat Countdown and the player begins a normal game -- if the\n   player was playing Nine Ball Cutthroat Countdown, the player also gets\n   the Nine Ball Bonus when scoring the Super Jackpot.\n\n   Cutthroat Countdown does not really interfere with the Center Pockets\n   except for the purpose of the Super Jackpot. Therefore, it is possible\n   to get Ball-O-Rama or Breakshot Frenzy during Cutthroat Countdown. The\n   multipliers apply to the sunk ball bonus but not the Super Jackpot;\n   therefore, a sunk ball during Cutthroat Countdown could be as much as\n   9M.\n\n   When Cutthroat Countdown ends, a normal game starts depending on which\n   Cutthorat Countdown started, and the player is automatically awarded\n   all balls that were sank during Cutthroat Countdown. This means that a\n   \"perfect\" Cutthroat Countdown (collecting the Super Jackpot with all\n   balls sunk) not only shows an interesting animation, but also spots\n   the next \"regular\" game and throws the player into the next Cutthroat\n   Countdown.\n\n   When the player has completed all the balls during multiple Cutthroat\n   Countdowns, subsequent Cutthroat Countdowns are worth double the\n   points (2M per ball, 4M times balls for Super Jackpot). Completing the\n   balls again makes the points triple (3M and 6M); there is no further\n   increase.\n\n  Capcombo\n\n   A Capcombo can be scored two ways:\n\n     * by a Bank Shot loop (the Bank Shot does not have to be lit)\n       followed by a Right Loop shot (the Right Super Cue does not have\n       to be lit).\n     * by a Left Super Cue followed by a Right Loop Shot.\n\n   It awards 250K.\n\n  Pinfo\n\n   Holding in a flipper button for a while during a game gives \"Pinfo\"\n   screens with useful information like:\n\n     * Player number, Ball number, and current score\n     * Number of stacked extra balls\n     * Number of tilt warnings left\n     * High Scores\n     * Score needed to get a free game\n\n  Buy In\n\n   Extra balls can be bought for one credit each by pressing start after\n   the game ends but before the match.\n\nEaster Eggs\n\n   The Capcombo animation is that of the moose kicking a cow, a dig at\n   Bally/Williams.\n\n   In the attract animation sequence where (something) falls down the\n   female's bosom, her teats are visible through her clothes for one\n   frame. The same sequence also appears during the match sequence, but\n   the frame only appears when there is a match.\n\nNeeding (Personal) Verification\n\n     * Are the balls in Rotation Cutthroat Countdown called in order or\n       randomly after the player has gone through the list once?\n     * Does the Left Super Cue *really* have to be hit consecutively to\n       increase the Bank Shot Bonus?\n     * Does the Bank Shot sink a ball? Always sink a ball?\n     * What is the maximum Ball-O-Rama jackpot value?\n     * What is the maximum Ball-O-Rama or Breakshot Frenzy jackpot value?\n     * How many points are subsequent Nine Ball Bonuses worth? How are\n       they determined? Is there a limit?\n     * Calculating Bonus\n     * When is Collect Bonus lit? Once at the beginning of each ball?\n     * Status of locks during transitions within a multi-player game.\n\nUnanswered Questions\n\n     * In a multi-player game, is the lock difficulty shared by all\n       players or is it different for each player?\n     * What happens when Eight Ball is finished for the second (or third,\n       etc.) time by hitting the 8-Ball saucer and a successful Call Your\n       Shot is scored? One Million Points? Does the Cutthorat Countdown\n       multipler apply to this?\n     * To do: hypertext links within this document\n     * What other stuff is in Pinfo?\n     * Machine Credits, Copyrights, Production trivia, etc.\n\nVersion History\n\n     * Version 0.0 -- November 15, Wei-Hwa Huang, first draft\n     * Version 0.1 -- November 19\n     * Version 0.2 -- November 23\n       Fixed several errors after feedback from the FSPA.\n     * Version 0.4 -- November 24,\n       Received an e-mail from Neil Schuldenfrei that helped immensely.\n       (He says he's been wanting to write a rulesheet for while but\n       hasn't gotten around to it.)\n     * Version 0.5 -- November 25\n       A few more suggestions from Steve and Dave.

{"page_content": "Subject:      BREAKSHOT not-so-quick take\nFrom:         sbb@panix.com (Steve Baumgarten)\nDate:         1996/05/13\nMessage-ID:   ro4tpkfjzu.fsf@panix3.panix.com\nNewsgroups:   rec.games.pinball\n\nBREAKSHOT is the latest game from Capcom, the company that debuted in\nthe pinball world last year with PINBALL MAGIC.\n\nThis is going to be a quick preview of a game that's still undergoing\nsome fine-tuning; as the Broadway Arcade is a beta site for Capcom, we\nget their games before most other people do, but we also get them\nbefore they've been finalized.  All of which means that I'm not sure\nthe game I've been playing for a few weeks now is not a final,\nshipping product; in fact, I'm pretty sure it's due to get upgraded\nROMs that will include new rules, perhaps new animations, sounds and\nmusic.  So what I say here should be viewed in that light, and my\nopinions about the game will likely change as the game itself changes.\n\nOK, with caveats out of the way, here's an overview.  BREAKSHOT is\nthe first in a series of games called \"Capcom Classics\"; basically,\nthese are games that will evoke instant nostalgia in anyone who grew\nup playing pinball in the early 70s and can remember playing, say,\nBANK SHOT or EIGHT BALL when it was first released.\n\nIt's a game that screams \"retro\" in almost every way: the playfield is\nvery simple, with a definite 70s look to it.  Big, wide lanes; some\nrollovers at the top center with pop bumpers underneath them; a simple\nlower playfield design with a standard inlane/outlane configuration.\nNo ramps, habitrails, dancing Martians, wacky gorilla toys or magic\nwands -- this game is simple, with a clean, uncluttered playfield that\nis nonetheless not barren and wide-open.\n\nHere's how Capcom describes the game, from the BREAKSHOT web page:\n\n  http://capcom.ms.wwa.com/pinball/breakshot/breakshot.htm\n\n  A Breakshot Feature in the center of the playfield simulates a pool\n  table's corner and center pockets, qualifying both Trick and Combo\n  shots. This feature is the industry's first ever loadable captive\n  ball; it holds up to 2 balls, and when a 3rd ball is loaded, a\n  3-Ball \"Breakshot Frenzy\" begins. BREAKSHOT also features a captive\n  ball that can be hit from many angles (rather than just one), a\n  wonderfully smooth full loop shot, a 3rd flipper that shoots a \"Bank\n  Shot\" in the upper right-hand corner, a playfield that doesn't hide\n  the ball from your sight, a 2-Ball \"Ball-O-Rama\" and a moose...  how\n  could you lose with a moose!?\n\nHow indeed?  Especially when the moose is prone to moon you when the\ngame is over...  ;-)\n\nBREAKSHOT plays not quite like a golden oldie, but not quite like a\nstandard new pinball machine, circa 1996.  Its wide lanes and lack of\nramps and habitrails make for a very different play experience -- you\nget a feeling that you're very much in control of the game at all\ntimes, just as was the case many years ago when games were much\nsimpler.  Sad to say, but it's almost disconcerting now to play a game\nwhere you can see the ball at all times -- BREAKSHOT has no scoops or\ntunnels to take the ball underneath the playfield, and no big toys for\nit to hide behind.  Everything is out in the open and in plain sight.\n\nSo it's a little disconcerting, true, but it's also very refreshing.\n(Interesting, too, that ATTACK FROM MARS is game that almost always\nkeeps the ball in sight, and that this is something that people seem\nto have responded to.)\n\nOne way that BREAKSHOT does not differ from modern games is in its\nspeed of play: although it looks like a classic pin, it plays as fast\nas any new release, which can lead to some very 90s-style insta-drains\nas the ball ricochets off a corner of the ball lock area in the center\nof the game and flies down an outlane.\n\nThe ball lock is actually a combination ball lock and captive ball.\nIt occupies the center of the playfield and consists of 3 saucers set\nback behind a narrow entrance passage.  The entrance has an opto that\nsenses when a ball enters the lock area; as soon as one does, an\nup-post comes up and keeps the ball from draining back out (assuming\nyou weren't able to shoot it directly into one of the saucers).\n\nThings get interesting inside that ball lock -- once a ball is resting\non the up-post, it becomes in effect a captive ball.  Hitting the\nup-post sends the ball up into one of the saucers; and if you have two\nballs resting on the up-post, one will end up going to the far left\nsaucer while the other goes to the far right saucer.  It's a great\neffect -- it looks and feels exactly like pool.  In effect, the game\nsets up a break shot for you so you can lock two balls at once.\n\nLocking the third ball starts multiball and Breakshot Frenzy, where\nall scores are 3x.  (There's also a 2x 2-ball multiball frenzy, worth\ngoing for just to hear the moose announce \"Ball-O-Rama!\")  Jackpots\nare gotten off the center saucer and are harder to get than you might\nthink.  Playing multiball in BREAKSHOT is a much different experience\nthan playing it in AFM: you get no ball saver, just one jackpot shot\n(which requires careful aim), and a playfield that encourages you\neither to loop the balls around the outside orbit or bounce them off\nthe center ball lock area -- both of which will keep them screaming\nback down to the flippers.  Needless to say, BREAKSHOT jackpots are\nnot gimmees, and doing well in multiball is not only very satisfying,\nit's one of the things that keeps me coming back for more.\n\nSound and dots are much, much better than PINBALL MAGIC -- it's\nobvious that Capcom is making great strides in this area.  Not quite\nup to WMS standards, perhaps, but well ahead of Premier, and their\nsound package is already better than anything SEGA has done recently.\n\nThe A/V package also provides for a couple of nice retro touches; my\nfavorite is the way the display is used TOMMY-style to simulate\nscoring wheels.  The display programmers even put in scoring lag,\nwhere the \"wheels\" sometimes don't turn fast enough to keep up with\nyour score; once it even looked like one of the wheels got \"stuck\" for\na while between digits.  Very nicely done.\n\nThe display also features a nicely designed game-specific font that's\nexactly in keeping with the feel of the game -- it's another example\nof the way all the artwork in this game comes together and presents\nthe game's theme in a consistent fashion.\n\nThe sound package is simple and features male and female voices\ncalling out the number of each ball you sink.  They also guide you\nthrough the game, telling you which of the 3 games (8-ball, 9-ball or\nRotation) you'll be playing next.  Anyone who ever played EIGHT BALL\nwill feel downright nostalgic listening to the game call your shots;\nfans of XENON, too, will find something to smile about in listening to\nthe female voice...\n\nArtwork overall is very good -- again, very retro, EIGHT BALL-style\nfeaturing guys, girls, and the girls' cleavage all playing pool, with\na goofy-looking moose head looking on from the wall.  There's only one\nunfortunate touch: the backglass is lit with a single fluorescent\nbulb, rather than some number of individual incandescent bulbs.  The\nresult is much less attractive than it might otherwise have been, but\nI know full well why Capcom chose to compromise their design in this\nway: from what I understand, BREAKSHOT sells for about $1000 less than\na typical WMS game.  If you're going to knock that much off the price\nof your game, you have to cut corners somewhere, and this seems like a\nreasonable compromise to make, especially since it doesn't affect game\nplay.\n\nI've found only 1 nod to the r.g.p. crowd in this game; I'll list it\nbelow, under a spoiler warning, for those who don't want to discover\nit on their own.\n\nOverall, BREAKSHOT is a very solid game, one I've had a good time\nplaying for several weeks now.  If you're looking or the latest in\nhigh-tech pinball, this game will be quite a disappointment -- it's\nreally very straightforward, a fast-playing but somewhat old-fashioned\ngame.  But if you're looking for a game that you'll be able to play\nand understand almost at once, one that might bring back some fond\nmemories of a time when all pinball was simple and accessible, then\nyou'll want to give BREAKSHOT a try.  In addition to being a real trip\ndown memory lane for those of us who grew up with pinball in the early\nseventies, it's a lot of fun all on its own.\n\n[ spoilers follow ]\n\n        |\n        |\n        |\n        |\n        |\n        |\n        |\n        |\n        |\n        V\n\n[ spoilers follow ]\n\nAlthough the BREAKSHOT mascot is a moose, there *is* a cow in this\ngame.  Just go for the \"Capcombo\" shot, which you make from the upper\nflipper around the mini-loop, and then backwards around the right\norbit to the rollover lanes.\n\nJust to set this up right: when you relight the kickback, you see the\nwords \"Kicker added\" in the display, accompanied by an animation of\nthe moose kicking his back legs.\n\nWell, score the Capcombo and watch as the moose kicks a cow in the\nbehind -- a nice shot at WMS, I thought, and a nice nod to the\ncow-counters in r.g.p...\n\n--\n    Steve Baumgarten       |  \"New York... when civilization falls apart,\n    PANIX, New York, NY    |   remember, we were way ahead of you.\"\n                           |\n    Email: sbb@panix.com   |                            - David Letterman\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "BREAKSHOT", "manufacturer": "Capcom", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/breakshot-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

I retain any and all rights\nto this guide.  You may take this guide and redistribute it and/or make\nchanges to it as long as it remains freely distributable and this policy is\nstated at the beginning of it.  No charge may be made from the distribution\nof this guide and no one may make a profit from it.  Send comments/updates/\nsuggestions/corrections to me.\n\nThe only other legal mush to say is that The Machine Bride of Pinbot is made\nby (and probably copyrighted/trademarked/whatever) by Williams Electronics.\n\nImportant Things\nThis is more or less a glossary of the shots that will be referred to during\nthe discussion of the game.\n\n\n Skill shot  There are 5 different lanes the ball can land in.  The way it\nis set up, the ball can get some weird spin on it and go pretty\nrandomly into one of the holes.\n Jets  The trio of jet bumpers in the upper-right area of the playfield.\n Left lane  The furthermost left shot possible, right next to the Shuttle\nRamp.  It is a precision shot.\n Shuttle Ramp  The big ramp on the left leading up to the face and the\nPinbot mini-playfield.\n Left loop  Starts just to the right of the Shuttle Ramp and exits down the\nleft lane.\n Heartbeat Ramp  The big u-turn ramp right in the middle of the playfield\nthat leads back to the right flipper through a double-\npassageway controlled by groves in the plastic.\n Spinner  Does nothing except score 1000/spin.\n Right loop  Starts to the right of the Jets/spinner passageway and exits\njust above the right slingshot and feeds to the LEFT flipper.\n Standup (5K) targets  1 on the left side, above the left slingshot, and 2\non the right just under the right loop entrance.\nGetting all 3 increases bonus multiplier.\n Face  The big cube with the flashing lights around it.  You really can't\nmiss it!  %)  Since it is a cube (well, rectangular prism anyway),\nthere are 4 faces on it.  It can rotate left or right to change.\n Pinbot mini-playfield  The platform on the upper-right corner on top of the\nJets.  When the ball goes up here, it can either\nfall into the Jets, feed to the right flipper via\nthe Heartbeat Ramp return lane, or feed to the skill\nshot via the path opposite of the Heartbeat Ramp.\n\n\nThe Loops\nThe loops work like this:  When no value on the loop is lit, you get the\nlowest one on there, and it starts flashing.  The flashing score is the LAST\nscore you got for that loop.  Actually, more specifically, it indicates the\nnext score you'll get by shooting the loop, which would be the next-highest\nnon-flashing one.\n\nOnce a score is flashing, it'll continue to flash until either you get the\nloop again, or it times out.  The amount of time depends on the loop.  If a\nvalue times out, it'll start counting down on the next-lowest value (if\nthere is one).  If the loop is at its highest value, then if the value times\nout, the loop will be back to the bottom again.\n\n\n Left loop  Scores 25K, 50K, 100K, 500K + light extra ball.  The shot will\ntime out about every 10 seconds, and you can only light the extra ball\nonce per ball or extra ball off of the loop, even if you start again from\n0.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on how many you can get for the\nwhole game, though.  Technically, you could have \"Ball 1\" forever.\n Heartbeat Ramp  I put it here because it counts as a loop.  It scores 100K,\n500K, 1M.  It times out between 5-8 seconds.  Usually easily backhanded\nfrom the right flipper for unlimited millions.\n Right loop  Scores 25K, 50K, 100K, 500K + light jackpot.  Like the extra\nball, the jackpot can only be lit from the loop once per ball or extra\nball.  If the ball goes in far enough through the EXIT of the loop (to\nhit the microswitch at the end), you'll get a free advance bonus\nmultiplier.\n\n Loop combos  A loop combo is scored by shooting a number of loops in fairly\nquick succession (not more than 3-4 seconds between loops, if that much).\nThe combo starts at 4 loops.  Getting 4 loops pretty quickly will cause\nthe game to start making lots of banging/explosion-type noises and say\n\"4 loop combo - 500,000 points.\"  After that, the number required for a\ncombo goes up by one, and each of them are worth 1M.  No matter how many\nyou get, all except the 4-loop combo are worth 1M.  The number of loops\nneeded for the next combo is given to you in the Status Report.\n 10-Loop combo  Supposedly, if you work your way up to getting a 10-loop\ncombo (this means getting the 4, 5, ..., 9-loop ones first!), you score\nthe \"Backdoor Billion.\"  I have never done this.  Someone tested the\nBackdoor Billion theory with the glass off by hitting the Heartbeat Ramp\nsensor over and over.  This might not have been the best way to test it,\nbut it did in fact give him the Billion after 51 Heartbeat Ramps.\nGetting a 10-loop combo means shooting 49 ramps, so it is still unclear\nto me if it is the 10-loop combo or hitting 51 Heartbeats in a row.\n(Which is a pretty damn hard thing to do.)\n\n Jets  These do not count as loops, but the Jets bonus is displayed in much\nthe same way as a loop score.  Hitting the Jets a certain number of times\n(I have no clue as to the exact number; I estimate 50) advances you a\nJets level, which goes from 25K, 50K, 100K, and 500K.  Nothing special\nother than these bonus points, though.  Not even the value of the Jets\ngoes up.  (It's always 10K/hit if you want to know.)  After getting the\n500K, the number of hits needed to get the next bonus goes up a bit.\n\n\nAt the end of a ball, the number of loops you got that ball is multiplied by\n10K and added to your total bonus, which can then be multiplied.\n\nLeft Lane\nThe left lane serves 3 purposes:  Spin the small wheel, collect jackpot, and\n\"power charge\" during multiball.\n\nSmall Wheel:  Shooting the ball up the left lane ANYtime except during\nmultiball and when the jackpot is lit spins the small wheel.  Your awards\nare:\n\n\n Light Jackpot\n 250K\n Extra Ball\n LIGHT Extra Ball\n 50K\n 100K\n\n\nThis is hardly a random feature.  It will give you whatever it damn well\npleases (i.e. 90% 2, 5, or 6).\n\n\n Collect Jackpot  The jackpot ranges from 1M - 8M and is increased by\nnormal play (usually hitting Jets).  You can light the jackpot by either\ngetting it from the small wheel or by shooting the right loop 4 times.\nYou get 20 seconds to try to shoot it back up the left lane.\n Power Charge  This is a score you get for getting it up the left lane\nduring multiball.  It starts at 100K and goes up 100K with each shot up\nto 1M.  These points are NOT doubled during multiball, and resets to 100K\nat the start of each multiball.\n\n\nShuttle Ramp\nThe reason the Shuttle Ramp is called the Shuttle Ramp is because of the big\npicture of a space shuttle in front of it.  When lit, a solid shot up the\nramp will send the ball into the Pinbot area.  Otherwise, the ball will go\ninto the Face.\n\nHere is the normal sequence of events for shooting the ball up the ramp:\n\n Pinbot area\n Face - activate voice; 250K; Face changes to #2.\n Pinbot area\n Face - partial optical link (1st eye); 250K; launch another ball.\n Pinbot area (maybe)\n Face - 2nd eye; activates optics; 1M (500K x 2); starts multiball; Face\nchanges to #3.\n\n\nIn multiball, all scoring is doubled (except for Big Wheel awards, the\njackpot, and Power Charges).  Also, the main goal is to get the balls back\nup the ramp.  Here's what happens as you do:\n\n 1st ball on Face #3 - Human Influx; 500K (250K x 2); ball is locked.\n 2nd ball on Face #3 - Metamorphosis; 1.5M (750K x 2); changes to Face #4;\nballs released again.\n 1st ball on Face #4 - Increased Pulse; 500K (250K x 2); ball is locked.\n 2nd ball on Face #4 - Spins the Big Wheel; 2M (1M x 2); releases both\nballs to try to spin the Big Wheel again.\n\n\nBig Wheel awards:\n\n 10 Million\n 50 Million\n Special\n 5 Million\n 1 Million (what a ripoff!!)\n Lights 1 Billion (collected by shooting Heartbeat Ramp in 12 seconds)\n\n\nWhen multiball ends, what happens next depends on how far you got.  If you\nDIDN'T get a metamorphosis, then your next left lane or Face shot will turn\nthe face back to #2 (the eyes).  (You're much better off trying to turn it\nback via the left lane since you'll get points that way.  You don't get\nsquat if you shoot the ramp.)\n\nIf you DID get metamorphosis, then at the end of multiball the next Face/\nleft lane shot will turn her back to Face #1!  Even if you didn't get a\nsingle Big Wheel spin.  Also, as noted above, getting metamorphosis causes\nthe Shuttle to light in between eye shots on Face #2.\n\nThe face can get screwed up on some machines (for instance, only being able\nto turn to the right).  When this happens, the machine will tend to do some\nstrange things (esp. if it's on the 1st face during multiball %) ).\nHowever, you'll always get credit for shooting whatever you're SUPPOSED to\nbe on eventually.  (I've experienced \"Partial optical link\" - \"I can speak!\"\n- \"Partial optical link\" all with ONE shot.)\n\nPinbot values:\n100K - 200K - 300K - 100K - 200K - 300K - 600K + light extra ball\nThe Pinbot values are scored every time the ball enters the area.  It resets\nafter awarding the extra ball.  So every 7 Pinbot shots lights the extra\nball.\n\nMisc. Scoring\nThe bonus and bonus multiplier seem to have no limit.  I've gotten over 1.4M\nbase bonus before (excluding loops), and a multiplier of 6x.  I've heard of\nsomeone getting at least 9x bonus.  The best way to rack up bonus is to\nshoot the Jets.  If you get all of the Jets awards in one ball, your bonus\nwill be well over 1M before loops.  The highest total bonus I've gotten is\nlike 11.9M with multipliers.\n\nAnother potentially big source of points is the skill shot.  The skill shot\nmultiplier will start at 1x for the beginning of each ball.  This is ONLY\nregulation balls in play.  EVERY time the ball goes back to the plunger, be\nit from the Pinbot area, shooting another ball after locking one in the eye,\nor starting an extra ball for that ball, the multiplier will increase by 1.\nI've gotten it up to around 17x, and I've heard of it being as high as 23x.\nThat could potentially be a whopping 4.6M for the skill shot!\n\nSince none of these seem to have limits, they can really help out your score\nin the long run.  You'll never score a billion by just going for these\nscores, but they can help your standing in the high scores or Billionaire's\nClub.\n\nWIMP extra ball:  Lit when the game feels terribly sorry for you.  If you've\nhad a really bad game (no Shuttle Ramp shots, few (if any) loops, and a low\nscore) then the extra ball will be lit for you.  There's no warning, it just\nis.  There are lots of games that do this; BoP is by no means unique in this\nregard.  (What are some others?  T2, HS2, Diner, Dr. Dude, Police Force,\netc.)\n\nAlso on the third ball, if you haven't hit the Shuttle Ramp yet, it'll spot\nyou the Pinbot area (well, you won't get points for it) so you can shoot\ndirectly for Activate Voice.\n\n\"High\" Scores\nSince BoP is a special case, some explanation is needed for the way it\nhandles high scores.\n\nWilliams knew it would be unfair to put billion-point scores in the regular\nhigh score chart (since it can only hold 5), so they came up with the\n\"Billionaire's Club.\"  This separate high score chart keeps track of the top\n19-20 scores for anyone who's made the billion shot.\n\nI say 19-20 top scores, because any time you make the billion shot, you are\nGUARANTEED to get onto the Billionaire's Club.  If your final score is lower\nthan the lowest total in the Club, then you'll still get to put your\ninitials in, get your 2 credits (if that's what your machine is set for),\nand get 20th spot in the Club.\n\nThen there's the standard high-score table.  This has Grand Champion and the\nother more recent top 4 scores just like any modern Williams pin.  Now,\nthough it's good that they split them up, this brings in the 50 million Big\nWheel award.  It's not really a problem if you get the billion too, but if\nyou just get the 50M, that'll throw off your score more than anything else\nin the game.  Surprisingly enough, the 50M is a bigger score-unbalancer than\nthe billion shot!  They really should have come up with something else, but\nwhat can you do?\n\nStrategies\nShoot the Shuttle Ramp.\n\nSeriously, though, that really is the point of the game, is mastering the\nShuttle Ramp.  It's too bad, but if no one at your machine can make the\nbillion, than maybe some of these suggestions will help.  Even though it is\nobviously a one-shot game, I still really enjoy playing it because it's a\ngood challenge and provides excellent practice in handling multiball.\n\nWell, first I'll start with multiball.  If you want to go for the billion,\nthen you have to get the balls back up the ramp.  There are a few ways to do\nthis:\n\n\n   Hold up the left flipper as the balls come down, and give the game a\nlittle upward nudge to get the ball to the right.  Shoot the first\none back immediately, since you don't have a terribly long time until\nthe other ball gets down there too.  If your game isn't maintained\nvery well (like ours), then it'll eventually get too slow to be able\nto do this.\n   Shoot both balls up the Heartbeat Ramp to pass them to the right\nflipper.  Risky, since all but 1 BoP I've played has the Heartbeat\nRamp center drain you on a weak shot up the Ramp.  You can usually\nnudge the ball back to safety, but still...\n   Shoot the first ball through the right loop, then backhand it up the\nShuttle Ramp.  This actually works on our machine most of the time.\nThis shot is also probably going to take a little practice.  Also, on\nour machine, the backhand shot is usually the same time the second\nball gets to the left flipper, so it doubles as being able to quasi-\nlive-trap the second ball so you can take your time getting it back\nup the ramp.\n   Since I can't pass balls via method 1, the way I do it all the time\nnow (unless I want a challenge) is to shoot both balls up into the\nJets!  Usually the first one will stay up there long enough to get\nthe second one up there, too.  They'll both thrash for awhile (and at\n20K per bumper hit, that's not bad), and usually feed out at a pretty\ndecent interval.  When the first ball comes down, I dead-trap it, and\nthen it's in perfect position to shoot it up the Shuttle Ramp.  Do\nthe same thing with the other ball (dead-trap it).\n\n\nNow some other scoring strategies since we've discussed the most important\nones (to get the billion!).\n\nSince scoring is doubled during multiball, one good idea is to hold 1 ball\nin the left flipper or lock it in the Face and shoot the Heartbeat Ramp.\nThis will give you unlimited 2-millions.\n\nAvoid the Power Charge shot; it really isn't worth the trouble it is to hit\nit.  Especially if you consider that a miss will often hit the left rubber\non the Shuttle Ramp and go down the left outlane.\n\nAlways shoot the Jets when you can.  The amount of bonus you can get from\nthem is just enormous after awhile.  And usually you'll get a safe return to\nthe right flipper.  There are those times, however...\n\nIf you're getting bored with the billion, or you're really good at loops,\ntry to shoot the left loop (extra ball) at the start of each ball.  This can\nmake your games last a long time.  Don't forget about the standard lane-\nchange feature!  Except that in this game, the left flipper moves the extra\nball light to the left, and the right flipper moves it to the right.  This\nis instead of the normal \"any-hit-moves-the-target-to-the-right\" routine.\nIf you shoot the Shuttle Ramp and your ball will come back, there's no\nreason not to get the extra ball.  Note that the Heartbeat Ramp feeds the\nball BELOW the return lane sensor, so you can't collect the extra ball from\nthe Heartbeat Ramp.  Tricky, huh?\n\nI nifty shot I've developed on our machine is to get in a right loop-left\nloop groove.  You can start by shooting the right loop, then just at the\nright moment, backhand the ball (still with the left flipper) up the right\nloop.  The ball should come back in just the right spot to return it to the\nright loop, etc.  You can get fairly high-numbered combos doing this.  (I've\nonly gotten up to a 6-loop combo, BTW.)\n\nDon't forget that the loop combos are ANY loops.  Hitting the Heartbeat Ramp\n4 times in a row counts as a 4-loop combo.\n\nIf you have a high bonus (you can check with status report), then consider\nactually shooting for the standup targets.  They are not really dangerous\nand can be worth a lot in the long run.  Usually they'll often just hit\nthemselves, so it's not a big deal.  Just keeping the ball alive can net you\nsome high multipliers, whether you mean to or not.  Don't aim for the bottom\nof the right loop, though; that's usually a sure drain, and the ball will go\nup there by itself off of a slingshot or something.\n\nThere's a bug in the game (unless it falls into the \"it's-not-a-bug-it's-a-\nfeature\" dept.) where you shoot your 2nd ball into the Power Charge at the\nend of multiball.  If you get credit for the Power Charge while the other\nball is being registered at the bottom of the drain where it kicks it back\nto the reserve, DOUBLE SCORING WILL STAY ACTIVE!  Really!  I had noticed\nthis before, but only recently realized the circumstances at which it\nhappened.  Right after I realized it, I shot for it after the end of my next\nmultiball, and it worked.  So if you have a drain, shoot for the Power\nCharge as soon as you can.  If you get it at the right time, you're golden.\nHowever, it WILL end if you shoot the ball back up the Shuttle Ramp.  It\nmight also end if you shoot the Power Charge again, but I'm not sure about\nthat.\n\nEvery time you get a chance, either slam tilt or power-cycle the game (when\nthe guys are not looking of course).  It seems that the designers have put a\nlot (if not most) of their birthdays into the machines.

There are also\n\"2X\" and \"4X\" lights, showing the Bonus Multiplier.\nManual Plunger\n This is a normal plunger.  Its lane leads to the top arch over\nthe A, B, and\nC rollover lanes.\n\n\nRules\n\nThere are only a two main goals, completing the A, B, and C\nrollovers and completing the three drop targets. There are three\nsecondary goals, collecting the Extra Ball, maximizing the Bonus\ncount, and collecting the Special.\n\nA-B-C Rollovers\n\nRoll the ball over the rollover switches marked with\n\"A\", \"B\", and\n\"C\" lamps. Lit letters have not been collected yet.\nWhen complete, the end of ball Bonus is doubled\n(2X for most balls, but 4X for the last ball). Completing the A-B-C\nRollovers is one of two requirements for lighting Special on the A\nRollover lane.\n\nDrop Targets and Extra Ball\n\nKnocking down all three drop targets lights the Extra Ball\nfeature, but only \"sometimes\". There are two Extra Ball lights on the\nplayfield, at the Left Ball Kickout\nRollover, and one at the Right Ball Kickout\nRollover. Only one can be lit at a time, and the\nAlternating Relay is used to toggle between\nthem. An additional wrinkle is imposed though, the Extra Ball is only\nlit for certain Bonus Lights. As the bonus\nadvances, if the three drop targets are all down, the Extra Ball\nlight will come on and go off, and will cycle\nfrom side to side, so the game instruction card describes it as being\nlit \"occasionally\". In addition to this, collecting the lit Extra Ball\nfrom the side rollovers is not an easy shot. This limits the number\nof Extra Balls collected by players. Dropping all three drop targets\nis the second requirement for lighting the Special.\nExtra Ball vs. Bonus\n\nBonusExtra Ball Lit\n1000No\n2000No\n3000Left\n4000Right (3 ball only)\n5000Right\n6000Left (3 ball only)\n7000Left\n8000No\n9000Right\n10000No\n11000No\n12000Right (3 ball only)\n13000No\n14000Left (3 ball only)\n15000No\n\n\nSpecial\n\nOnce all three drop targets are down, and the A-B-C Rollovers are\ncomplete, Special lights at the A Rollover.\nIt remains lit, and can be collected multiple times, until the end of\nthe current ball in play. There are no direct shots at the rollover\nlane, though, so it is hard to collect and rare to collect more than\nonce.\n\nEnd of Ball Bonus\nAssuming that the player does not Tilt the game, when the ball\ndrains, the current Bonus amount shown by the playfield\nBonus Lights will be added to the current\nplayer's score. If the A-B-C Rollover\nsequence has been completed, the Bonus will be multiplied by 2. If\nthe game is on the last ball (ball 3 or 5, depending on Operator setting), the Bonus will be\nmultiplied by 2. The maximum Bonus is 15,000 (10,000 and 5,000 lights lit),\nand the maximum multiplier is 4X (2X for being on last ball, 2X for\ncompleting A-B-C), for a grand total of 60,000 points. On a game that\nrolls over at 100,000, a 60,000 point bonus is obviously significant.\n\nAlternating Relay\nThe Middle Pop Bumper is used to fire the\nAlternating Relay. Depending on Operator\nsettings the game can use this to make things slightly harder\non the player. The Alternating Relay moves the \nExtra Ball, when lit, from side to side, and moves the lit Spots\nfrom Left to Right.\n\nStrategy\n\nGet the Drop Targets to light the Extra\nBall. Get the Extra Ball. Then get the bonus\nmultiplier via the A-B-C Rollovers. Then hit\nthe Left and Right saucers\n(whichever one has the Spots currently lit) to run the\nBonus up. Note that the\nExtra Ball is NOT lit when the\nBonus is up to 15,000, so you must collect the Extra\nBall before maximizing the Bonus. Try to get the playfield Special if possible, but since there is no way to\nshoot for it directly, ignore it.\n\nOperator Adjustments\n\nBeing an electromechanical game, Bronco has several adjustment plugs\nthat the operator can use to tune the game play to the location. The\noptions are:\n\nGameplay\n\n3 balls per game or 5 balls per game. When set for 3 balls per\ngame, the Spot lights are lit on both sides\nsimultaneously and do not alternate, and there are more chances to\nlight Extra Ball.\n Extra Ball : Conservative or Liberal. When set for Liberal, the\nExtra Ball lights are both lit simultaneously and do not alternate\nfrom side to side.\n\n\nSpecial\n\n\nSpecial options are Replay or Extra Ball. \n\nEarnings\n\nThere is a small stepper unit that counts down\nfrom 90 to 00, stepping one time each time the Middle Pop Bumper\nis hit. This is used to compare against the last two digits of the\nplayers' scores at the end of the game. End of game\nMatch can be enabled or disabled. Match awards\n\"Special\". It is possible to set the game for Match and\nSpecial = Extra Ball, but in this case the game awards nothing if the\nplayer matches. \n Tilt Penalty = Ball in Play. \n Pricing - how many coins and how many credits per coin(s).\n\nSettings\n\nHere are the settings I use on mine:\n\nSpecials @ 78,000 and 90,000\nSpecial = Replay (credit)\nMatch enabled\n5 Balls per game\nExtra Ball = Conservative\nTilt Penalty = Ball in play\nPricing = 1 quarter / 1 play, 2 quarter / 3 plays.\n\nI also set the game up for optional free play by adding an SPST\nswitch to the Credit Unit to jumper the switch that lets the game\nknow that there are credits on the game to be permanently closed. By\nflipping the switch, the game reverts to normal use of the Credit\nUnit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Bronco", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/bronco.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Bronco", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n     Cactus Canyon Strategy Guide\n     by Keith Elwin and NES\n\n\n\n     Ahh Cactus Canyon. What could have been. This game was victim to the\n     upcoming Pinball 2000. It is very incomplete which is ashame\n     because with a little polish i think it could rank up there with\n     medieval madness.\n\n     Special thanx to NES for providing me with scoring tips since I\n     never got much of a chance to play it.\n\n     Post Pass: easy\n     deathsave: yes\n     Loop pass: yes\n     Bugs: unknown\n\n     Ball Control tips: Uh, well I could lie to you and pretend i know\n     what im talking about, but like I said I never got much of a chance\n     to learn this game. Therefore I have no tips for this game. Just a\n     kick-ass hi-score strategy.\n\n     CC Tip 1: You should combine Lost Mine multball and Showdown MB as\n     follows:\n\n     Clear first three show down targets (4th starts showdown). Get 2\n     Lost Mine locks and have the 3rd one ready to go so that you would\n     start Lost Mine multiball if you were to shoot the Lost Mine shot. Now\n     raise show down target (by first hitting one of the side orange stand-up\n     target banks twice which lights the return lane and then shooting the\n     appropriate ramp to feed the return lane). Then with the Show Down drop\n     target raised shoot Lost Mine to start Lost Mine multiball. Once LM\n     mulbll started shoot SD drop target and you now have combined multiball\n     which you can perpetuate forever since when you shoot all drop targets it\n     adds a ball (maximum of 3 in play) and keeps ball save on. Just make sure\n     when you're down to two balls that you start to focus on drop targets to\n     add a 3rd. Or if you have 3 balls shoot all drops but one, so that if you\n     get down to two you just shoot the drop target to re-add a 3rd. Then you\n     can keep hitting jackpot shots (every set of jackpots consisting of the\n     ramp and orbit shots increase the multiplier of the Lost Mine super\n     jackpot collected at the Lost Mine, so two sets of five gives 2*Super and\n     so on - using this combined multiball strategy Hal completed 5 sets to\n     collect a 5x Super Jackpot). Alternatively just keep shooting left orbit\n     during this combined multiball to get bonus X way up there. A lot of\n     times Hal will just keep trying to combine multiballs instead of trying\n     to finish High Noon. I prefer to do a little of both. On a good game a\n     player should be able to get four/five High Noons plus a few combined\n     multiballs to get a > 1B score (Hal got a 850 M on two different CCs\n     using this strategy). Note that Stampede could be combined w/ SD multball\n     but not anywhere near as lucrative as Lost Mine (a left shot during,\n     stampede results in an orbital feed rather than falling into rollovers for\n     bonus X whereas in LM it doesn't orbit unless the jackpot is lit on that\n     shot). Also note that when trying to set up combined LM/SD multi that you\n     are collecting a lot of bounty awards (lit by getting the SD drop target)\n     which could incidentally advance Rank or give EBs or light Quick Draw on\n     left outlane and so on.\n\n     CC Tip 2: The generalized Toy hit cheat: Like with Genie on ToTAN,\n     you can push machine for a free hit on Bart with ball in plunger\n     lane, provided tilt bob is somewhat liberal and Bart switch is sensitive\n     - works for a wide variety of games but ToTAN comes immediately to mind.\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Cactus Canyon", "possible_shots": "Lost Mine multball, Showdown MB, side orange stand-up target banks, return lane, ramp, orbit shots, left orbit, High Noon, Stampede", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/cactuscanyon.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

They measure 2-1/2\u201d. The \u201cFlipper Zipper\u201d was introduced in a\ngame called \u201cBazaar\u201d. The flipper-gap is closed by a skill shot where you tap\nthe Red Mushroom Bumper, located on the lower-middle right side of the\nplayfield. \u00a0The Flippers open when you tap one of three (3) Yellow Mushroom Bumpers,\nlocated in the center to left side of the playfield.\n\u00a0\nManual\nPlunger (Starting Skill Shot)\nThis is a normal plunger. Its lane is standard\nlength and leads to a gate, beyond which there is a Rollover Button at the top\ncenter, a Rollover Switch between two post and two Kick-Out Holes which may\ncapture the ball. \n\u00a0\nRollover\nButton \nThe Rollover Button at the top center is a\n10 point shot that also opens the \u201cCode Zapper Caper\u201d Gate and lights a\nporthole in the Sea Ray Ship.\n\u00a0\nTop\nRollover Switch\nThe Top Rollover Switch is between two posts,\njust below the Rollover Button and it is a 100 point shot. \n\u00a0\nKick-Out-Holes\n\nThere are two Kick-Out-Holes located at the\ntop to the left and right of the Top Rollover Switch. They do not score any\npoints. They capture and hold the ball, if there is not a ball in the Deep 4\nExit Alley. If the first ball is held than a second ball is produced to be\nplayed from the Manual Plunger, this also happens if both balls are captured. The\ncaptive ball(s) are released for Multi-ball by a skill shot where you tap the White\nMushroom Bumper, located on the upper-right side middle of the playfield. A\ncaptive ball, in the Kick-Out-Holes, will carry over from player to player and\ngame to game. If a ball is in the Deep 4 Alley then any ball that lands in a\nKick-Out-hole is immediately \u201ckicked out\u201d and put back into play.\n\u00a0\nCode\nZapper Caper Gate \nThis gate is located on the lower-left side\nmiddle of the playfield. It opens when the Blue Mushroom Bumper is tapped or\nwhen you cross the Rollover Button.\n\u00a0\nCode\nZapper Rollover Switch\nWhen crossed by the ball this switch\nactivates the Code Zapper Kicker Solenoid. \n\u00a0\nCode\nZapper Kicker Solenoid \nThe Code Zapper Kicker kicks the ball up\nthe left side of the playfield across the Left Rebound Gate Rollover Switch and\nback into play.\n\u00a0\nLeft\nRebound Gate Rollover Switch\nWhen crossed by the ball the Left Rebound\nGate Rollover Switch is worth whatever the Code Symbol is on the Code Zapper\nwheel.\u00a0 Triangle = 100 points.\u00a0 Circle = 300 points and a Square = 500 points. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCode\nZapper Symbols \nThere are 3 symbols. The Triangle, which is\nworth 100 points. A Circle, which is worth 300 points and a Square, which is\nworth 500 points. Symbols on the Code Zapper Caper wheel advance if one of the\nYellow Mushroom Bumpers is tapped, if the Blue Mushroom Bumper is tapped, if\none of the Out Lane Rollover Switches is crossed or if the Rollover Button, at\nthe top center is crossed.\n\u00a0\nDeep\n4 Caper Gate & the Free Ball Gate\nThe Deep 4 Caper Gate is located on the\nupper-right side middle of the playfield. It is open when there is no captive\nball. It closes when there is a captive ball or when a ball enters the Deep 4\nAlley.\nThe Free Ball Gate is located on the right\nside middle of the playfield in line with the Plunger Lane. It is closed to the\nDeep 4 Alley and opened to the Plunger Lane when a pinball is in the Deep 4\nAlley. It is opened to the Deep 4 Alley and closed to the Plunger Lane when the\nDeep 4 Caper Gate is opened. The function of this gate is to prevent a ball\nfrom entering the Deep 4 Alley if another ball is already present there.\n\u00a0\nRight\nRebound Gate Switch\nThe Right Rebound Gate Switch, located at\nthe top end of the Plunger Lane on the right side of the playfield, sets Player\nAdvance, Ball Return and Next Play relays. It keeps the machine sequence in\norder since balls can be held on the playfield by the Kick-Out-Holes and the\nDeep 4. It also turns off the Same Player Shoots Again Light. \n\u00a0\nDeep\n4 Alley Switches\nThe Deep 4 Alley Switches are actually one\nbar that is pulled in by the Ball Advance Solenoid that is activated when the\nWhite Mushroom Bumper is tapped. The bar has small levers that pivot when it is\npulled in and the levers kick the ball to the next step. A captive ball, in the\nDeep 4 Alley, will carry over from player to player and game to game.\n\u00a0\nSuper\nBonus Caper Unit\nCounts up one, each time you complete all\nsix porthole lights on the Sea Ray Ship. Points or a Free Game are awarded at\n5, 6, 7 and (or) 8. (See \u201cSea Ray Super Bonus Caper\u201d for details.) \n\u00a0\nLeft\nSlingshot Rebound\nThe Left Slingshot rebound is 10 points. It\nhas a solenoid that does kick the ball out to the playfield. (See Skill Shot\nbelow.)\n\u00a0\nRight\nSlingshot Rebound \nThe Right Slingshot rebound is 10 points.\nIt does not have a solenoid kick the ball out to the playfield. \n\u00a0\nOther\nRubber Rebounds \u00a0\nThere are 5 other rebounds. They are all 1\npoint each. Two are on the right side and three are on the left side of the\nplayfield.\n\u00a0\nThumper\nBumpers\nThere are three Thumper Bumpers. They are\nalways 10 points each. They should not have \u201c10 Points when Lit\u201d written on the\ntop.\n\u00a0\nLeft\nand Right Out Lane Rollover Switches\nThe Out Lane Switches are 50 points each.\nThey also advance the Code Zapper Symbol. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRed\nMushroom Bumper \nThere is one Red Mushroom Bumper, located\non the lower-right side middle of the playfield. It closes the gap on the Flippers.\nIt does not score any points when tapped.\n\u00a0\nWhite\nMushroom Bumper \nThere is one White Mushroom Bumper, located\non the upper-right side middle of the playfield. It is a 10 point shot. It releases\nany captive balls when tapped to start a two or three ball Multi-ball. It also\nmoves a ball down to the next Deep 4 Alley position.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\nYellow Mushroom Bumper \nThere are three Yellow Mushroom Bumpers,\nlocated in the center to left side of the playfield. They each score 100 points\nwhen tapped. Each one also advances the Code Zapper and lights one of the portholes\nin the Sea Ray Ship. They also open the \u201cFlipper Zipper\u201d if the flippers were\nclosed.\n\u00a0\nBlue\nMushroom Bumper \nThere is one Blue Mushroom Bumper, located\non the upper-left side middle of the playfield. It scores 10 points when\ntapped. It also opens the Zapper Gate and lights the Zapper Gate light.\n\u00a0\nTHE\n4 CAPERS: \n\u00a0\nCode\nZapper Caper \nThe Code Zapper Gate is opened when you tap\nthe Blue Mushroom Bumper or cross over the Rollover Button. When entering the\nCode Zapper Caper Gate the ball will cross the Code Zapper Kicker Rollover\nSwitch which activates the Code Zapper Kicker Solenoid. During this time the\nCode Zapper Gate closes. The Code Zapper Kicker kicks the ball up the left side\nof the playfield across the Left Rebound Gate Rollover Switch which gives the\nplayer points equal to whatever the Code Symbol is on the Code Zapper wheel at\nthat moment. The ball is then up at the top of the playfield and back into play.\n\u00a0\nDeep\n4 Caper \nThe Deep 4 Caper Gate is open when there is\nno captive ball. When you enter the Deep 4 Alley Gate the ball stops at the\nfirst of four steps and the Deep 4 Caper Gate closes. The ball is then moved to\nthe next step when you tap the White Mushroom Bumper. After moving the ball\ndown the Deep 4 Alley four steps the ball exits out of the Deep 4 Alley to the Plunger Lane and back into play.\n\u00a0\nSea\nRay Caper \nThere are six Sea Ray Porthole lights on\nthe ship in the middle of the playfield. To light all six portholes you can\ncross the Rollover Button at the top center of the playfield, tap the Blue\nMushroom Bumper or tap any of the three Yellow Mushroom Bumpers. The Sea Ray\nSuper Bonus Caper wheel for that player advances by one. (If you cover the\ncontact that has the white-brown to yellow wires on the Ball Return relay the\nlights for the Sea Ray will carry over to the next ball or player. It makes the\ngame even more interesting. This way, the Sea Ray Super Bonus Caper wheel has a\nbetter chance of increasing its\u2019 numbers.)\n\u00a0\nSea\nRay Super Bonus Caper \nEach time you complete a Sea Ray Caper \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the\nSea Ray Super Bonus Caper wheel for that player advances by one. This is\ndisplayed in the lower right corner of the back glass. A special can be set at\na Super Bonus Caper score of 5, 6, 7 and (r) 8. The Special is either a Free\nReplay or points equal to whatever the Code Symbol is on the Code Zapper wheel\nat that moment. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMULTIBALL:\nThe game has two different versions of\nmulti-ball play. If you have a ball locked in the Deep 4 Alley, the two Kick-Out-Holes\nwill simply kick the ball back into play without scoring any points. If the \nDeep 4 Alley is empty then the two Kick-Out-Holes will capture balls for multi-ball\nplay and the gate to the Deep 4 Alley will close. In other words both the Deep\n4 Alley and the two Kick-Out-Holes will trap balls for multi-ball play but if\none is active the other is not. As for releasing the trapped balls you would\nhave to hit the White Mushroom Bumper near the Deep 4 Alley. For balls trapped\nin the Kick-Out-Holes the mushroom bumper will simply release them into play.\nFor a ball trapped in the Deep 4 Alley, each time you tap the White Mushroom Bumper\nthe ball will move down one step. After four hits the ball will exit the Deep 4\nAlley and be returned to the Plunger Lane. \n\u00a0\nSome\nSkill Shots \n\u00a0\nWhen shooting a ball out into play, always\ntry to cross the Rollover button at the top of the playfield. This will open\nthe \u201cCode Zapper Caper\u201d Gate and light a porthole in the Sea Ray Ship.\n\u00a0\nWhen shooting a ball out into play, always\ntry to land the ball in one of the two Kick-Out-Holes. This will then give you\nanother ball in the Plunger Lane where you can try to cross the rollover button\nagain to light another porthole in the Sea Ray Ship and also land in the other\nKick-Out-Hole. This will also set the captive balls up for Multi-ball when you\ntap the White Mushroom Bumper. \n\u00a0\nWhen the ball is going to hit the left\nslingshot, tap the machine forward. This will push the ball towards the lower\nright rebound rubber causing it to bounce to the left side of the machine and\nthrough the Code Zapper Gate, if it is open. \n\u00a0\nIf you tap the machine forward a little\nharder, when the ball is going to hit the left slingshot, it will cause the\nball to go towards the Red Mushroom Bumper.\n\u00a0\nWhen a ball is near the right Thumper\nBumper on the right side, push the left front side of the machine to cause the\nball to move towards the White Mushroom Bumper.\n\u00a0\nWhen a ball is near the left Thumper Bumper\non the left top side, push the right front side of the machine to cause the\nball to move towards the Blue Mushroom Bumper.\n\u00a0\nWhen a ball is near the center Thumper\nBumper near the top on the right or left side, push the front side of the\nmachine to cause the ball to move towards the Kick-Out-Holes.\n\u00a0\nWith the Flippers closed and the ball\nresting between them, press the left flipper button to cause the ball to go\ntowards the White Mushroom Bumper or through the Deep 4 Gate, if it is open. \n\u00a0\nWith the Flippers closed and the ball\nresting between them, press the right flipper button to cause the ball to go\ntowards the Blue Mushroom Bumper.\n\u00a0\nWith the Flippers closed and the ball\nresting between them, press both of the flipper buttons to cause the ball to go\nbetween the Thumper Bumpers.\n\u00a0\nWhen in Multi-ball and the Flippers are\nclosed wait for all the balls to settle on the Flippers, then press either one\nor both of the flippers for some interesting results.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSOUND:\n\u00a0\nBell\nThe Bell, located in the back box on the\nleft side wall can be set for 10 points, 100 points, 10 and 100 points or off.\n\u00a0\nSounder\nThe Sounder, is a small knocker coil,\nlocated in the cabinet bottom at the front right side.\u00a0 It is energized with\nthe Replay Unit.\n\u00a0\nCREDIT:\n\u00a0\nBill O\u2019 Donnell\nJeff Grippe\nRob Hawkins \nBud \u201cFluid\u201d\nJim Everett\nKevin Martin\nIPDB.org\nJim Divoky (sold me the\nmachine)\nRick Swanson (just because)\n\u00a0\nThanks, BoB Graham\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Capersville", "possible_shots": "Code Zapper Caper, Deep 4 Caper, Sea Ray Caper, Sea Ray Super Bonus Caper", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/capersville.html", "title": "Capersville Rule Sheet", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Tiesma\n\nVersion: 1.0\n\nDate: August 14, 1997\n\nPlease submit additions and corrections to Scott R. Tiesma via electronic\nmail.\n\nThis document may be distributed freely provided it is not edited in any\nway and proper attribution is given.\n\n\nGeneral\n\nCapt. Fantastic is an offshoot of the Who's rock opera Tommy.  It features\nsome amazing artwork on the playfield and backglass.  This art is very\npolitically incorrect by today's standards and was to an extent when it was\nreleased as well.  The artist hid many sexual scenes in the backglass\ncausing the manufacturer to change it during production (by adding silver\nstars over the objectionable areas).  A home model of this machine was\ncreated as well but I do not have any knowledge of the differences between\nthat and the production version (but I do know they are different).\n\nScoring is only capable of handling 5 digit numbers.  As such, rolling the\ngame is not very hard to do (compared to achieving some modern wizard\nawards).  In the 8-10 games I've ever played I was within 10K of rolling it\nat least twice.\n\nCredits\n\n\n Greg Kmiec - Design\n Dave Christensen - Art\n\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nIn the standard way - starting at the bottom of playfield and working\naround clockwise.\n\n\n Left Flippers  There are two of these oriented such that they appear in\nseries (See ascii art drawing below).  \n\n\n================================\n=                 Plunger Lane =\n= Outlane------------------+ | =\n= V Slingshot       Inlane | | =\n=   V    Flippers        V V V =\n=|       V   V   V          | |=\n=| |:                  :| | | |=\n=| | :                : | | | |=\n=| +-_:              :_-+ | | |=\n=|     ``--          ___--+ | |=\n=|         ``--  --''       | |=\n================================\n= ``-- is a single flipper     =\n================================\n\n\n Left Slingshot  Normal.                 \n\n Left Outlane  May be lit for special.\n\nNote the lack of a left inlane.          \n\n Drop Target 5-Bank  Above the left slingshot is a series of 5 drop targets. \n\n Left Orbit  above the Drop Target 5-Bank is an orbit which deposits the\nball into the lane area.  This orbit contains rollover switches.\n\n\nIS THERE A STANDUP TARGET IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE BOTTOM BUMPER?\n\n\n Bumpers  Located in the top 1/2 of the playfield and centered left to\nright are three bumpers in the standard upside down triangle orientation.\n\n ? Targets  slightly above and to the left of the top left bumper is a\nstandup target.  A similar target is slightly above and to the right of\nthe top right bumper.\n\n Lanes  Located directly above the bumpers and in the standard orientation\nare three ball lanes.  The left and right are used for doubling the bonus.\nThe center lane is used for diverting a right outlane drain into the inlane.\n\n Lane Area and Rollovers  Directly above the lanes are three rollover\nswitches.  Furthermore, the exit gates of the left orbit and plunger lane\nare located above these switches.  Additional rollover switches are located\nin the left and right orbits.  The right orbit exit does not have a gate;\nthus allowing some balls which enter this area to exit via the right orbit\nshould they not fall through the lanes.\n\n Right Orbit  an orbit which deposits the ball into the lane area.  Three\nrollover switches are located in this orbit.\n\n Upper Right Flipper  directly opposite the Drop Target 5-Bank is a flipper\nwhich can be used to hit these targets.  This flipper also represents the\nstart of the right orbit.\n\n Right Outlane  May be lit for ?.  A diverter may also cause the ball\nto travel into the inlane.\n\n Outlane/Inlane Diverter  a diverter mechanism which will open due to\ncertain actions in the game.  This mechanism causes a ball traveling down\nthe outlane to enter the inlane.\n\n Right Inlane  lit for extra ball.  A ball which travels up the inlane (e.g.\nrolls across the right flipper and up to the inlane diverter) may open\nthe outlane/inlane diverter as well.\n\n Right Slingshot  standard slingshot.\n\n\nRules\n\nThese rules apply to each ball.  Nothing is carried over from one ball\nto the next.\n\nA ball which goes through the middle lane will open the inlane/outlane\ndiverter until it is used.  The diverter then closes and one may use the\nmiddle lane to open it again.\n\nBonus is built up by ??? (Star rollovers?)\n\nBonus may be doubled by the ball going through both the left and right lanes.\n\nCompleting the Drop Target 5-Bank once lights extra ball at the right inlane.\n\nCompleting the Drop Target 5-Bank twice lights special at the left outlane.\n\nCompleting the Drop Target 5-Bank three times awards a special.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Captain Fantastic", "manufacturer": "Bally", "possible_shots": "Left Flippers, Left Slingshot, Left Outlane, Drop Target 5-Bank, Left Orbit, Bumpers, ?

{"page_content": "From: adoerfer@abysus.enet.dec.com\nSubject: Re: Centaur II\n\nHere's a brief run-down on the multi-ball feature on CENTAUR and CENTAUR II.\nBy the way, when the game is over, press a flipper button to see the names of\nthese features.  Also, the voice should echo!  There's a reverb unit these\ngames.\n\nA \"orb\" or \"power orb\" is a ball (for multi-ball play).\nBalls are not locked on the playfield, they are represented by the 1-4\namber lights between and above the flippers.  You can \"capture\"/\"lock\"\nlight 1, 2, 3, or all 4.  Added to the ball in play, you can get 5\nrolling about the field at one time.  Balls are put into play automatically\nfrom a feed in the shooter lane that raises when a ball is fired from\na coil below the playfield.  Sometimes, the ball gets hung up and may\ngo to the shooter lane.  Now for some game features.  There are 2 release\ntargets, one behind the inline drop targets - the Chamber feature, and\none in the upper right above the shooter path.  When lit and hit, they will\nrelease all captured balls.  Making the 4 guardian rollovers (the blue\nlights above the lanes one the bottom sides that either go out or\nback to the flipper) will release one ball.  By the way, when you get 3\nguardians, the game will say guardian releases power orb.\nThere are 4 (white) drop targets below the 2 pop bumpers.  These are the\nO R B S  targets.  Making them in order from left to right will also\nrelease 1 ball.  Some features are switch settable.  See the description\nfor switches 15, 21, 22, 24.  Here's a run-down of what the switches do...\n(TURN OFF POWER BEFORE CHANGING ANY SWITCH SETTING - these switches are on the\ncpu board)\n\nSwitches\t\tdescription\ton\t\t\toff\n1,2,3,4,5\tcredits/coin\t\tnot important pricing settings\n6\t\t2x,3x,4x,5x bonus light lit light stays         off next ball\n7               All other bonus lights  stay on next ball       only 20,40,60 on\n8               Right 4 drop targets    1-3 drop next ball      all reset\n9,10,11,12,13   credits/coin            not important pricing settings\n14\t\tinline drop targets\tlit lite stays nxt ball goes back to 10\n15\t\tCaptured ball memory\tlit light stays lit\tall off nxt ball\n16\t\tGuardian Feature\tAll 4 always releases\trelease only 1ce\n17, 18,19,20    credits/coin\n21\t\tlast ball release\ton\t\t\toff\n22\t\tgive 1 light at start?  yes\t\t\tno\n23\t\ttilt disqualifies\tball in play\t\tgame(2nd time)\n24\t\tRight target release\twhen lit stays on\toff\n\n\t\tMaximum credits\n25 and 26 off, 10. 25 on 26 off, 15. 25 off 26 on, 25. 25 & 26 on, 40.\n\n27\t\tcredits displayed\tyes\t\t\tno\n28\t\tmatch feature\t\ton\t\t\toff\n29\t\tReplays per game award?\tall\t\t\tonly 1st\n30\tshoot balls every 15 min when game is over?  yes\tno\n\n\t\tBalls per game\n31 & 32 on, 2. 31 & 32 off, 3.  31 off and 32 on, 4. 31 on and 32 off, 5.\n\nSo, to get \"maximum\" multi-ball, set switches 15, 16, 24, 22, and 21 on.\nIf you want to \"test\", have switches 16 and 22 on, and push the 4\nbottom rollovers, when all 4 blue lights go on, a ball should fire.\nOr knock down the 4 center drop targets from left to right.\nHope this gets you going, and you can read the abbreviations....(nxt=next)\n_bill\n\tBad move, human. - CENTAUR\n    ________________\n\t           /__________*Adoerfer@abysus.enet.dec.com\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "CENTAUR II", "possible_shots": "orb or power orb, capture/lock light 1, 2, 3, or all 4, 2 release targets, 4 guardian rollovers, 4 (white) drop targets below the 2 pop bumpers (O R B S targets)", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/centaur.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

It's printed\non almost every part of the playfield.  If you are a first timer, you can look\nat the board and see what you will need to do in a certain area.  It won't\nexplain everything, just the basics.\n\n\nFlippers -- 2 Standard flippers.  Can't go wrong here.\n\n\nPost -- Located between the flippers.  This is similar to A13, MA (Mario\nAndretti), and Fire!. It goes up when you start a new ball, when you start\na fight, or as an award from Poker Night (Ace High).  When it goes up, it's up\nfor a short time.  If the ball goes through the post during the game, you lost\nthe ball.  Too bad.\n\nAt the start of a new ball (except for balls after locks), if the ball goes\nthrough the outlane while the post is up, then the ball is saved. Ball will\nNOT be saved if you won the fight, post is up and ball went though the\noutlane.  Exceptions are..\n      - When completing 3rd fight, you start Raid M.\n      - When completing 5th fight, you start Champion M.\n\nAlso, ball is lost when during fight, the ball ends up in the outlanes unless,\nSecond Wind is lit.\n\n\nSlingshots -- 2 Basic standard ones.\n\n\nLeft inlane/outlane -- Same.. When the ball goes through the inlane, the\njackpot at the right orbit (or scoop) is lit for a short time unless it's\nalready lit.  Outlane, you're out of luck unless Second Wind is lit.  There is\nNO kickback.  There is a post nearby to adjust the length of the outlane.\nThe jackpot light alternate when the ball goes through the slingshot.\n\n\nLeft Saucer --  Similar to NBAFB.  Call it the corner shot.  Starts Spittin'\nGallery, Poker Night, awards Extra Ball, increase the purse value and start of\nthe Ultimate Challenge (Grand Finale)^.  It will also start the fight. It will\nusually add 1/2 life towards start fight.\n\n^It will be lit when everything is completed.  You can start the grand finale\nby shooting left/right orbits as well.\n\n\nLeft Orbit/Scoop --  Shoot this goes to the saucer which will flip up to the\njump rope area if Jump Rope is lit.  Otherwise, the scoop will go down and it\nwill feed to the left inlane. (If it is down, award in a similar fashion as\nthe right Scoop). It will start the fight as well.  When it leaves, it will go\ndown on the habitrail to the left inlane.  During Multiball sessions, it will\nloop around and exit through the right orbit (similar to NBAFB).\n\n\nJump Rope --  Not easy to explain here.  Basically, there is a magnet which\nholds the ball, a sensor?, small stick that pops up when you hit the flippers,\nand an object which moves around during jump rope sessions.  When doing it, an\nobject will move around and when you press the flippers, a white stick will\npop up making the ball go up and down. Sensor? I don't know if there is one,\nbut it may be used for how many jumps completed.  The optimum time to flip the\nball is when the jump rope is even with the crease in the right flap.\n\n\nLeft Ramp --  Used for going up to the Speed Bag area, awards Jackpot when\nlit, or increase the Purse Value and add 1-2 life bars during the fight. There\nis a diverter at the top of the ramp to go either way.  In any case, it will\nfeed the right habitrail towards to right inlane.  It can also setup to earn\njackpot.\n\n\nSpeed Bag --  When you are in that area.. there is a punching bag and two\nplastic objects (hands).  Use your flippers to move the hand in which you hit\nthe bag. The left flipper for left, right flipper for right. You have 5\nseconds to hit as many as you can.\n\n\nPop-up post --  This will pop up when your supposed to go to jump rope area\nfrom the left or to a lock area on the right.\n\n\nInner-left passage #1 --  You can't access it.  Generally feeds to the saucer\nfrom the left orbit.  Will pop-up to the jump rope area.\n\n\nPop-up saucer -- When the ball lands there, it will pop-up the ball into the\njump rope area, where you either jump, or move along the habitrail to the left\ninlane.\n\n\nTwo Yellow stand ups -- One is located near the left ramp, other is located\nnear the right orbit/scoop.  Each hit will count towards increasing the\nMultiplier by 1.  It takes 3 hits to increase the multiplier so 3 hits you\nwill get 2X Mult., another 3 hits, 3X Mult. etc.  There is NO Hold Bonus. I am\nnot sure what the maximum bonus is (hope is not 250X like MM/AFM/MB/CC. If it\nis, sue me).\n\n\n2 Green Hook Ramps -- (that's the official name from Bally/Williams).\nGenerally does is to hit towards the head.  This awards you K.O. or a head\nshot award.\n\n\nHeavy Bag/Big Person -- This is a major part of this pinball game much like\nthe Ringmaster in CV.  Generally, you will start hitting heavy bags for a\nwhile.  When fight starts, or during Champion Multiball or F. Multiball, it\nwill turn around and you will see a man.  The arms used are movement to punch\nyou during a fight.  Sort of like Sega's Frankenstein, but not close.\nOccasionally, if heavy bag is shown, the ball may get stuck in the back which\nyou may have to wait until the machine does the ball search.\n\n\nInner Right Passage #2 --  You can't access it.  Generally feeds to the lock\nmecinism.\n\n\nLock Mecinism --  Generally locks balls if Lock is Lit, or lands there during\ndoor prize in skill shot or start fight begins.\n\n\nRight Orbit/Scoop --  Similar position to JY.  Shoot this will award Lock, or\nStart Fight.  If scoop is down, it will count towards start of hurry-up value\nor towards lighting K.O. or add value during hurry-up.  During M-ball\nsessions, it will loop around and exit the left orbit.\n\n\n3 Beer Yellow Targets --  Light all 3 and the purse value will increase and/or\nlight lock which earn you towards 2nd and subsequent reg. multiball.  3rd or\nlater, you will need to light the yellow targets 2x each.  If you lost the\nball, the targets will still be lit until you hit all 3 (unlike Merlin's Magic\nfrom MM where it resets when ball is lost).\n\n\nRight Inlane/Outlane/Against the Ropes --  This gets to be tricky explaining.\nMaybe you can help me out here.  Inlane/outlane is standard (same as left).\nOn the right side past the beer yellow targets, you are\n\"Against the Ropes\"/Danger Zone.  There are a series of posts at staggered\nlocations.  The ball may land in the Ball Launcher, Right Inlane, Right\noutlane, or back into the center playfield.  It's like Plinko (sort of) from\n\"The Price is Right\" (TV Game Show).  Only it's flat.\n\nIf it ends up in the launch area, it will shoot it up and put the ball back in\nplay or start a match.\n\n\nLED Meter -- Used in fight situations, lights will flash or steady.  Shows\nyour level meter on your strength.\n\n\nObjective\n---------\n\nThe objective of this game is to earn jewels on the belt.  You need to do the\nfollowing elements.  Each element earned awards 500K.\n\n-Training Jewel\n  * Minimum of 6 Jumps in Jump Rope. (cumulative)\n  * Minimum of 6 Hits in Speed Bag.   (cumulative)\n  * Approximately 10 hits on Heavy Bag.   Only counts toward a jewel when you\n    earn your life bar towards Start Fight.\n\nOnce you complete the minimum requirements, you cannot do them again until you\ncomplete the others (e.g. if you completed jump rope, you cannot use that\nmethod again until you completed Heavy Bag and Speed Bag).  When you did all\nthis, you can start them again.\n\nFinish it again, you earn another 500K.\n\nIn those training sessions on Jump Rope and/or Speed Bag, after 10 consecutive\njumps/hits, 2x purse value will be added.  After 20 jumps/hits (consecutive),\nyou will be awarded a Smart Punch.  Get as many as you can and see if you can\nbreak the record.  \"Keep training, Kid.\"\n\nFor Jump Rope session, the maximum jumps allowed is 30. If you made 30 jumps,\nyou can put your initials at the end of the game for being a Jump Rope\nChampion (no credit, though). This is the same for Speed Bag. Maximum hits\nis 30.\n\n-Earn 3 Multiballs\n  * F. Multiball (explain in Multiball session)\n  * Raid Multiball (After winning 3rd fight)\n  * Multi-Brawl (Regular Lock 3 Ball(s) method to start this type)\n\n-Get a K.O. during a fight\n  To do this.. you need to go through the scoops 1 each, 1 on each side so if\n  you did a jab combo on one side, you will need to do it on the other side.\n  Each jab combo is  worth 50K. If you did them, one of the K.O. lights is lit\n  (towards the green ramp) and you have approximately 5 sec. to get a \"head\n  shot\" to beat him.  You can also press the Launch Button to simulate the\n  \"Smart Punch\"/head shot and it will award a K.O.  The 2nd time requires 3\n  Jab Combos, 3rd time, 4 JC, etc.\n\n  NOTE:  If one of the scoop diverters is broken in the up position, it is\n  impossible to earn a K.O. towards Ultimate Challenge.  So the alternative is\n  to do the \"Cash Fight\" method through the rest of the game. (Unless you\n  earned Royal Flush in Poker Night and awarded a jewel which happens to be\n  the K.O. jewel in which you can earn towards UC).\n\n\n-Complete all 15 Jackpot Levels  (Self Explanatory)\n  During normal mode, if you went through the inlane to one of the lighted\n  \"Lit Jackpot,\" [7] then one of the jackpots will appear for a short time,\n  which you would have a chance to earn it. You can also make it lit by.. go\n  through the left ramp to make it lit, by skill shot method, or as an award\n  from Door Prize.. Jackpots are lit during reg. Multiball, and Champion\n  Multiball.  Jackpots start at 100K and increases by 100K up to 1.5 Million.\n  You will maxed out at that point thereafter.  Jackpots are cumulative.  I\n  haven't seen a jackpot this low (100K) since Medieval Madness.\n\n[7] The \"Lit Jackpot\" alternate between inlanes each time a slingshot fires.\n    Only happens in a normal session.\n\n\nHere are the names used for types of jackpots...  (do you remember Latin?)\n\nJackpot                    100,000\nDouble Jackpot             200,000\nTriple Jackpot             300,000\nQuadruple Jackpot          400,000\nQuintuple Jackpot          500,000\nSextuple Jackpot           600,000\nSeptuple Jackpot           700,000\nOctuple Jackpot            800,000\nSuper Jackpot              900,000\nMega Jackpot              1   million\nUltra Jackpot             1.1 million\nTurbo Jackpot             1.2 million\nMaximum Jackpot           1.3 million\nCow of a...Jackpot        1.4 million\nJackpot Deluxe            1.5 million\n\n\nIn addition, you need to..be Pub Champion... to do this..\n\nWin 5 fights. After the 5th fight, Champion Multiball starts and you are the\nPub Champion.  If 2 to 4 players earned it. The last person get to put in the\ninitials at the very end of the game.\n\nOnce you complete, you will get a chance to do the Ultimate Challenge.\n\n\nQuotes for start of game\n------------------------\n\"Good to see you, Kid.\"\n\"Good to see you again, Kid.\"\n\"Welcome to Champion Pub, Kid.\"\n\"Welcome back, Kid.\"\n\n\"I'm your coach, Kid, and you will need to pay attention.\" (?)\n\"I'm your coach, Kid, and you will need some training.\"\n\n\"I'm your coach, Kid, _________________________________.\" (etc..)\n\n\nStart of Game\n-------------\n\nWhen you start your game, 3 life bars has been started for you.  You will also\npress and hold the launch button until you let go, choosing what award you'll\ntry to get.\n\n\nSkill Shot\n----------\n\nThis is different.  Similar to JY, but you will need to hold the Launch\nbutton.  When released, you will get that award as the ball pops up from the\nlaunch area and loops around and exits the left orbit towards the left flipper\n(similar to FT).  Sometimes, it will hit an object and will go either to the\nlock mechinism (which will eventually award lock if lit), or exit through the\nright orbit.  There are different awards to offer.\n\n\n10 - Earn 10 points.  Very dismal.\n5X - Get Bonus Multiplier 5X added so you start with 6X.\n2X Purse - Double the current Purse Value\n! - Starts Hurry Up Mode (Shadow Boxing)\nM - 1 Million Added to your score\n$ - All Jackpots Lit (Remains lit till you collect it)\nFist - Smart Punch\n\n! and $ alternate each other during skill shot session.\n _\n|$| - Door Prize.  If selected, you will see people and penguins leave the\n -    pub and determines what award you will receive.\n\n      If this is selected, ball will be forced into the lock area. You won't\n      award a lock, just a place where a ball can be rested while the computer\n      will search a prize for you.\n\n      Here are the possible awards from Door Prize:\n\n\n             * Lite Spittin' Gallery (Video Mode)\n\n             * Lite Poker Night      (Video Mode)\n\n             * Second Wind (will lit in one of the outlanes) Similar to\n               Recycle in JY, but you can only get it through door prize\n               or in the hurry-up mode the 3rd time.\n\n               When used, ball would be saved, 3 health bars added, and\n               if ready, will start fight for you.\n\n             * Six Health - Add 6 life bars towards start fight\n\n             * Start Fight - All life bars filled up and Lights Start Fight\n\n             * Extra Ball Lit - Guess what it does.\n               It can be accumulated.\n\n             * Light Lock - Ooh.. a toughie.

Will\n                    award if you have 2 players or more.\n\n             * Smart Punch - Earn 1 smart punch.  You can use it during\n               the fight. Press the Launch button when you want to use it\n               during the fight session (similar to a Troll Bomb in MM). SP\n               awards the same as a head punch so its possible to use to award\n               a K.O. that way.\n\n               You can press the launch button during normal sessions to see\n               how many smart punches that you currently have.\n\n===========================================================================\n               [1] Light Lock option can be available after you completed\n               Multi-Brawl the 1st time.\n\n\n\nHurry-up Skill shots.....  (Shadow boxing)\n---------------------\nYou get to do this by ..\n\n  1) Go through the scoop 3 times during a normal session or during Contender\n     Challenge session.           (or)\n  2) As a skill shot award        (or)\n  3) Flush hand from Poker Night.\n\nYou need to hit the heavy bag once as fast as you can.\n\n1st time the Value starts at 200K and it descends down towards ___K\n2nd time the Value starts at 400K\n3rd time                     600K....etc..\n\nIf you go through the scoops, the value is increased by 200K and will start at\nthe new value and will go down..You also be awarded a Jab Combo which is 50K.\n\nsuccessful completion\n\n1st time -- Smart Punch\n2nd time -- Poker Night lit\n3rd time -- Lite Second Wind (outlane)\n4th time -- Extra Ball lit\n\nAfter the 4th time, it will start from the beginning (Smart Punch) again, but\nyou will need 3 more jabs each time to start the hurry up.\n\n\n\nVIDEO MODES\n===========\n\nThere are 2 video modes in this game...\n\n\nSpittin' Gallery\n----------------\nYou can earn this by\n      + Door Prize award\n      + When you win your 1st fight\n\nIn this one, you will need to move the platoon around using your flippers\n[left flipper to move left, right flipper to move right].  There are 6 men\nside by side.  You will need to move around and catch the spit before it hits\nthe floor.  You will need to catch 10 of them before you miss 3.  If you miss\n3, too bad.  Occasionally, an EB will spit out.  Catch it, and you will get an\nautomatic extra ball (similar to FT where you shoot water skiers).  Sometimes,\nyou will see a 2nd EB spits out if you missed the first one..\n\nScoring: 2.5M + 250K * each spit caught + 2.5M if finished + 2.5M if perfect.\n\nso.. you earn 2.5 million bonus for catching 10.  If you did it perfectly, 2.5\nmillion bonus will be added (clean victory) thus, the maximum total would be\n10M.\n\n\nPoker Night\n-----------\n\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|If you don't know how to play poker, ask around and hopefully, they will   |\n|teach you the basics about poker.  You will need some basic knowledge to   |\n|play in this mode.                                                         |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nYou can earn this by..\n        - Door Prize Award\n        - Completed the hurry-up mode the 2nd time\n\nYou have 15 seconds to decide which card you want to keep and discard..  (This\nis a one shot deal).  Use your flippers to move to a certain card, Press the\nLaunch Button to discard or undiscard.  Here are the awards for completing\nthis...  If it gives you a great hand the first time the best way is to wait\nfor the time to expire.  Sort of like video poker, but this is for amusement\nonly.\n\nHere are the possible awards from Poker Night:\n\n\nFold        -- Big points 250K\n\n\nFold w/\nAce High    -- Red post will pop up for a short while.  If the ball went\n               through the outlanes while this is up, ball would be saved.\n               Remember, if the ball went through the post, tough luck for\n               you [6].\n\n\nRoyal Flush -- Jewel will be awarded for you. (from left to right so if you\n               already have a training jewel, it will give you the next jewel\n               that you need).  If you already had all jewels earn, it will\n               award you 500K instead.\n\n\nPair        -- Doubles the purse value\n\nTwo Pair    -- Increase the Bonus Multiplier by 5X\n\n3 of a Kind -- All Jackpots Lit\n\n4 of a Kind -- Extra Ball is Lit\n\nStraight    -- Start Fight lit (ready to do battle)\n\nFlush       -- Hurry Up mode started (shadow boxing)\n\nFull House  -- Automatic start of multi-brawl (extra).  This will not count\n               towards how many M-brawls that you had.  This is a free for\n               you.  You will be awarded a mark towards M-Ball jewel if you\n               haven't got one yet.\n\n\nStraight\nFlush       -- Maxes out the Purse value which is 60M.  This award is very\n               rare. (Thanks to \"Poncke\" for this info).  You cannot increase\n               the purse value any higher.  Hope when you start fight, you\n               don't lose to your opponent for this amount. This award is\n               very rare.\n\n[6] Ace high - [4 crap cards and 1 ace].\n\n\n\nMULTIBALLS\n==========\n\nMultiballs can be stacked with the exception of Ultimate Challenge (similar to\nCV).\n\nThere are 5 types of multiballs used in this game.  All of them have a short\nball saver regardless of the red post.\n\n\nMulti-Brawl\n-----------\nBasic 3-ball lock method to start this.  1st time, shoot the left orbit 3\ntimes to start it.  2nd and subsequent times you need to light all 3 yellow\nbear targets to lite lock individually or as an award from the door prize.\n\nWhen you lock the first ball, you will see the animation of someone throwing\nthe chair past the can can girls towards the wall which you earn 250K.\nQuotes...\n\n \"Thats ball 1, slugger.\"    \"Ball 1 is all locked up.\"\n\nWhen you lock the second ball, you will see a bartender making drinks and\nsuddenly, he looked up and runs for cover as someone threw the bottle at him\nwhich shatters the mirror.  You earned 250K for this.  Quotes..\n\n \"One more, and its Multi-Brawl!\"\n \"One more, and this pub goes bullistic!\"\n\nLock the 3rd ball and .......  (guess).\n\n\nJackpots are lit. The left ramp, right orbit, and bag/man is available for\nmaking a jackpot. You will need to make one of those requirements to re-lit\nthe jackpot again. This means, you need to shoot the left ramp, hit the\nbag/man and right/left orbit one time, before you can do them again.\n\n\nFisticuffs Multiball\n--------------------\nThis is a 2-ball multiball.  To get this, you need to hit the heavy bag\nseveral times to spell out BAR FLY FISTICUFFS to get this (much like spelling\nout MULTIBALL in JY).  You can hit the heavy bag at any time to accumulate\nthis.  When it happens, the object will turn and you will see a man.  The head\nshot is work 500K and gut shot is worth 100K.  Its sorta funny depending on\nyour view.  You will hear weird music and the voice is very drunk when is\nannoying, but can be fun.\n\n*If You want a quote list, see John Lane's quote list for available info.\n(Available at one of the address above).\n\n\nRaid Multiball\n--------------\nThis is a 3-ball multiball.  The ONLY way you get to do this is when you win\nthe 3rd fight.  When this happens, you will see the animation that people are\nleaving the bar.  Someone will yell \"run lads, its a RAID.\"  Every switch the\nball goes through increases the value by 1,000 points from 5,000 to 50,000\npoints [4]. When you max it, every switch will earn you the maximum until\nall, but 1 ball remains or ball is lost.\n\n[4]  Settings for Raid Multiball will vary from machine to machine.  In my\nmachine, it will start at 5K and will go up.  Some start at 10K or whatever.\nDon't complain to me about this as I already noted it.\n\n\nUltimate Challenge Multiball\n----------------------------\nSee Ultimate Challenge\n\n\nConcurrent Multiballs\n---------------------\n\nI've borrowed this from Matt Magnasco.\n\nRaid and M-B are 3-ball multiballs, and F. Multiball are 2-ball.  If you stack\nthem, you will get a 4-ball multiball, and a fresh ball saver which is similar\nto CV.\n\nHere are the combinations for stacking multiballs:\nThis is what I have seen.\n\nRaid--F. Multiball--Multi-brawl [2]\nRaid--Multi-brawl--F. Multiball [2]\nRaid--F. Multiball\nMulti-brawl--F. Multiball\nF. Multiball--Multi-Brawl [2]\n\nMulti-brawl [from Poker Night]--Multi-Brawl--F. Multiball [2] [3]\nMulti-brawl [from Poker Night]--Multi-Brawl               [2] [3]\nMulti-brawl [from Poker Night]--F. Multiball--Multi-Brawl [2] [3]\nChampionship Multiball--Multi-Brawl  [2]\n\n[2] This happens if and only if the next lock will get M-B.\n\n[3] You can have Multi-Brawl twice if you earn it from Poker Night.\n\nOk.. When you are close to receive a new M-ball session (like you need 1 hit\nto start F. Multiball), and all balls drain, but one, you have a short grace\nperiod (about 1 sec) to do it.  If you did it successfully, you will earn that\ntype of multiball plus other multiballs that you currently have.  It's not\nuncommon to get a big score from this and/or increase bonus X to a high level.\nThis does NOT work in Champion Multiball.\n\n\nChampion Multiball\n------------------\nChampion Multiball is only stackable with Multi-Brawl if the next lock will\nstart (you will need to start C-M first).  To get this, you will need to win\nthe 5th fight.  If you did, you are pub champion, awarded 1M for being a\nchamp, and C-M starts.  It is a 4-ball multiball that combines Raid--F.\nMultiball--Multi-brawl all in one.  You can earn jackpots, increase switch\nvalue, etc.  You will also awarded Pub Champion of 1M for every major shot you\nmake.\n\n\n\nFight Against Your Opponents\n============================\n\nOnce you have filled up your life bars, you are ready to fight.  Shoot for the\nsaucer, or left/right orbits.  Anything else that is lit will be turned off\nincluding lite lock so you can start the match w/o delays.  You can still earn\nan EXtra Ball if it is lit.\n\nThe first match will be against 9th/10th ranked person.  The 2nd is 7th/8th.\n3rd..5th/6th.  4th..2nd/3rd/4th.  5th.  1st ranked.  You will fight the best\nfighters in the world (game wise).  Come on, this is 1894.  Ranking is based on\nperformance from past pinball players who fought them before who either\nwon/lost against them.  Now each pinball is different in ranking so you may or\nmay not fight the person that you're fighting against.\n\n12 life bars=full bar\n\nOnce you start, the announcer will say \"Ladies and Gents, ______________\n(insert fighter here) vs. the Kid.\"  For the 5th fight, the announcer will\nsay \"Ladies and Gents, for the title of Pub Champion, _____________ (insert\n1st ranked fighter here) vs. the Kid.\" Post will also be up as well. You will\nalso see the KO light on the outer lanes and SDTM.  If you have Second Wind,\none of the K.O. lights will be off and if you went through it, 3 life bars are\nadded and ball saved.\n\nThen the fighter will tell you nice or taunting things that you are going to\nlose. You will also see at the lower part of the DMD what the purse value is.\nYou  can increase the purse value by landing the ball in \"The Corner,\" the\nleft ramp, or light all 3 beer targets during this session. In addition 1 to 2\nlife bars will be added towards you.\n\nBell rings..fight has started.  Your job is to hit the person in the center.\nEach gut shot (regular hit) deducts 1 to 2 life bars away from the person.\nYou will be awarded 100K for every hit taken. Head shots are 500K and deducts\n3-6 life bars from the person.  Of course, you opponent will take away your\nlife bars as well so do expect that.  You can also use one of the Smart\nPunches which is equivalent to a head punch.  Awards 500K and deduct 2-3 life\nbars from your opponent.  If you don't have anymore smart punches, then you\nwill hear a buzzer indicating that you don't any smart punches left.\n\n\nAfter a certain time, the post will be down.  It will take about 4-6 hits\nor more depending on the person to defeat it.\n\nEach time you hit your opponent, you will see the picture of the fighter, who\nis hurt, broken eyes, bandages, etc. till you win (or lose).\n\nEvery time when you take a hit or hit the person, there are voices that will\nsay something.  Mostly, your opponent.\n\nIf the ball is stuck behind the hand of the man, sorry, you would have to wait\nuntil a ball search is on or moves till ball is free.  I have nothing to do\nwith this if it happened this way.\n\nWhen you complete enough jab combos (see above), you will have a chance to do\na K.O. [one of the K.O. is lit towards your opponent]. You have approximately\n5 seconds to hit them in the head to win the fight and awarded a K.O.  (don't\nforget, you can use your smart punch for this).  If you are unsuccessful, then\nit's back to a normal fighting session.. and you may need to start over.\n\n[ NOTE: Jab combos will vary in different settings.  Some settings is that ]\n[ when you make a JC, it will deduct 1 life bar from your opponent, others ]\n[ won't so don't e-mail me about this.                                     ]\n\n\nCheat: (this is from Matt Magnasco)\n    If your game's tilt isn't that sensitive, shaking the machine forwards and\nbackwards will usually cause the boxer's chest to trip its switch and deduct\nhealth bars from your opponent.  It is possible to defeat the boxer without\nthe ball even being kicked back into play this way.\n\n\nFighters\n--------\n\nHere are the fighters (in no particular order).  Remember, ranking is based on\noverall performance from other pinball players who have played this machine.\n\n==Master Bim Bam Boom (from Asia)\n==Knuckles O' Brian (Irish)\n==Sir Winston Pounds (English) [The English Gentlemen]\n==Dan Unda (Australia) [From Down Under]\n==Franz Von Pain (German)\n==Armando Santiago [The Spaniard]\n==Steveo [USA] from San Francisco\n==Pierre Lepunche (France)\n==Antonio Jaberini [The Cook With the Hook] (Italian)\n==Patrosky Yirbitov (Russian)\n\n*Quote list is available from John Lane (at the web address above).  He did a\ngreat job on it.  Also, his rulesheet gives some perspective about the\nfighters.\n\n\nSome Coach quotes during fight:\n------------------------------\n\"Yea, your winning!\"\n\"Shake up, Kid.\"\n\"You're getting clobbered, Kid.\"\n\"You're losing this one, Kid.\"\n\"He's running out of gas.\"\n\"Go there and show them what you're made of.\"\n\"Careful, Kid.  Careful.\"\n\"Punch his face.\"\n\"Punch his jaw.\"\n\n\nLose a fight\n------------\n\n-During the fight, if the ball goes on the outer lanes, SDTM, your opponent\n will take 4-7 life bars away from you and you lose the fight, and the ball.\n What a loss.  This is much worse if you risk your points and lost it all.\n\n-You can also lose the fight if your life bars went empty before your opponent\n does.\n\n-Remember.. you can always build up your life bars and try to fight against\n him again.  However, it could be harder (the 2nd or 3rd time) so be careful.\n\n-If you TILT the machine during the fight, you are automatically KOed so you\n automatically lose the fight.\n\n\nWin a fight\n-----------\nIf you win the fight, you collect the purse value, and pat yourself on the\nback.  If you win by a K.O., you will collect the purse value, get a 1 million\nbonus for doing this and (if necessary) earned a jewel worth 500K.\n\nIf you get a flawless victory/perfect, start fight is automatically lit for\nthe next fighter.\n\n\n+Awards for winning 1st-5th fights\n\n1st Win -- Lite Spittin Gallery.  If it is lit already, then so be it.\n                                  It is NOT cumulative.\n\n2nd Win -- Extra Ball is lit\n\n3rd Win -- Start Raid Multiball\n\n4th Win -- Contender Challenge\n\n    Contender Challenge is a hurry up mode where you need to shoot all major\nshots to earn points.  You start at 1 million and it descends down towards 25K.\nEvery time you make a shot, it will awards you X amount of points and goes\nback to 1M.  Contender ends when all shots are completed, timed out after the\nlowest possible score, or ball is lost.  Contender Challenge will not happen\nif you start fight immediately after the last one.  Contender challenge can be\nstopped by a video mode or start fight??  Don't forget, the reg. hurry up mode\nis up there.  Watch for it. Can be concurrent w/ Multi-Brawl if you start that\nfirst or awarded Full House in Poker Night.  Complete all shots, and start\nfight is lit.  If you successfuly completed all shots, then Start Fight is\nautomaticly lit.\n\n5th -- Pub Champion -- Champion Multiball begins -- Everything is lit.\n\n--\nWin or lose, when the fight is over, you can still hit the the person as\nhe speaks at the end of the for a Sucker Punch worth 500K. You can do this\nuntil the hear the da..dup sound, then you do what is necessary in this\ngame.\n--\n\n\n 0--Cash Fight, Risk your Points--0\n===================================\n\nIf you did not get the jewels on the belt to start the grand finale, then you\nwill start the Cash Fight.  Use your flippers to choose which fighter you want.\nYou have 10 seconds to do this.  The points risk are determined by your score\nso far and the rankings of the fighter that you have just fought.  (Similar to\nRS when you use your points to buy things), but you are risking it.  You will\ndo this method when you build up your life bars until you fulfill the\nrequirements.\n\nOnce you selected your opponent, you are ready to fight.  Post will be up for\na short time (shorter than your regular fight, and it could be harder). If\nyou win, you will get the points added to your score, plus the purse value. If\nyou lose, tough luck.  Points will be deducted from your score.  If the score\nis below the replay value, you won't get the replay again (only 1 instance per\ngame) [like RS].\n\nThe maximum Cash Fight award is 240M.  You score could increase exponentially.\nWow!  This is regardless of how high your score is (I don't care if it is 1.5\nbillion).  That is the max cash award you can earn (or lost).  In v1.6\nROMS, the Cash Fight awards are altered if you have 200M or better to make\nit more reliable.\n\nIf this is your first time doing this, start small and work your way up so you\nwon't get a big loss for starters. If you have the confidence of risking it\nall and you have the skill/guts to do so, fine, then do it.\n\nYou will do Cash Fights as well after you did UC.\n\n\n0--Ultimate Challenge--0\n========================\n\nOk...you have completed the requirements on the belt, now you are ready for\nthe final battle.  In order to start, first build up on your life bar\n(training). Once you did that, start fight is lit and the left saucer will\nhave \"Ultimate Challenge\" is lit instead of \"start fight\" shoot the left/right\norbits and/or \"The corner\" to start this.\n\nYou will fight the 5 remaining fighters which you did not fight in the past\nwill fight against you.  You are going to try to beat all 5 fighters with 1\nlife bar.  Can you do it?  You will start with the bottom 10. As you beat the\nindividual, you will fight another person with a higher ranking.\n\nRemember, its 1 against 5 so good luck.\n\nIn addition, you will get a UC Multiball with a brief ball saver. [Regular\nfighting rules apply].  You are trying to get as many hits as you can to beat\nthe fighter(s).  Successful completion of this can earn you over 50 million.\n\nIf you lose all but 1 ball, all is not lost.  You can play with a monoball (1\nball), and regular fighting rules apply.\n\nIf you win, congratulations. You are the best.  You will do ______________ .\n\n--Lost to UC--\n\nIf you lost to UC, you will be awarded based on your performance.\n\nIf you still have at least 2, and you lose to UC, you will start F. Multiball\nautomatically.  If it is 1 ball, then back to normal play.\n\nIf you lost to UC, via outlanes/SDTM, you are ousted. [Means that you are very\ndisappointed that you lost].\n\nWin or lose...once you complete this, you're done. You will do \"Cash Fights\"\nfor the rest of game.  It can bore you out at times.  You can only do the\nwizard mode once which is really awkward to most pinball games in which you\ncan start over and do them again. This is for v1.5 ROMS or earlier.. for\nv1.6 ROMs, you may start over from the beginning (that I'm not sure).\n\n\nMisc.\n=====\n\nBar fly\n-------\nIf you hit the heavy bag and you hear an insect buzzing, hit the Launch button\n(quickly), and you will get either a \"Cow Fly,\" \"Bob Fly,\" or a \"Bar Fly.\"\nYou will be awarded 100K and a Smart Punch.\n\n\nCows\n----\nThe only cows that is known are 1) during a bar fly, a picture of a cow is\nshown and says \"mooo.\"  2) 14th Jackpot worded \"Cow of a... Jackpot\" which\nawards 1.4 million.\n\n\nReplay\n------\nThe sound when you earned a free credit is similar to the Sega's pinball\nmachine where you hear a \"toink\" instead of a \"thwack\" which is similar to\nCV.\n\n\nBugs\n====\n\nTaken from John Lange. (hope this is ok).  Happened to the machine that I\nplayed as well.\n\nBug #1    -[Later fixed in v1.6 ROMS]-\nThere is a MAJOR bug in this game.  I don't know if this applies to your\nmachines or not.  After the Ultimate Challenge, win or lose, in any method\nother than 1 ball left, the game will turn into a non-mode session.  Nothing\nis working except for F. Multiball which you can do it repeatedly.  How\ndevastating this is.  This will also effect through the rest of your balls and\nother peoples' games as well.\n\nYou can remedy this by shutting the machine off, then turn it back on.  When\nyou do this, the credit(s) would not be lost.\n\nFor me personally, this game is useless after a while.  Except when the high\nscores resets and I could start over, trying to achieve to a high score.\n\nThis bug is fixed in v1.6 ROMS.  If this happens in your machine, you\nare playing an old bug. Bug the operator/manager to get the new ROMS.\n\n\nBug #2\nAfter you win the 5th fight, if the ball went to the left orbit and the\nlock is the 3rd lock, you will get a regular Multi-Brawl instead of\nChampion MB, but when you finish it, you are still Pub Champion no matter\nwhat. Just be patient and let Champion MB start first, then try to get\nM-B.\n\n\nBall Searches\n=============\n\nBall Search.. if the ball is stuck somewhere in the playfield, the machine\nwill do a ball search til it freed itself.  If not, then one of the balls from\nthe lock will be released and put the ball in play (if any). Otherwise, after\n4-5 ball searches, the ball is considered lost and you lost the ball.  The\nball would be at the launcher on your next ball (unless, it is your last ball,\nthen tough loss for you.  Hope you get your money back for this).\n\nSega pinball machines still wins. On those machines, if the ball is stuck\nand after 4-5 searches, it will flag the ball is missing and serve a new\nball (til all balls are gone). Hey, it's better to get a fresh ball rather\nthan losing a ball.\n\nP.S. if the ball is stuck in one of the man's arms, and movement is broken,\nyou are \"up the creek\" (til a tech. person comes and takes it out or\nwhatever).\n\n\nExtra Balls\n===========\n\nExtra Ball can be awarded/lit by..\n\n      -Door Prize Award\n      -Spittin' Gallery (Video Mode) -- by spitting EB out.\n      -After Winning the 2nd fight\n      -Hurry-up mode the 4th time (Shadow Boxer)\n      -4 of a Kind in Poker Night (Video Mode)\n\n\nAnimation of extra ball is when a train runs towards you.\n\nTaken from Bowen Kerins\n\nExtra Balls can be cumulative.  The default behavior is to allow 4 extra balls\nper ball in play.  Like MM, CP can allow a limit on the number of extra balls\nthat a player may receive on any ball.\n\nIn retrospect, this is how I've observed in watching and playing on this game.\nIf you disagree with it, let's talk about it.\n\n\nFun with Bonus\n==============\n\nBonus is consist of\n\n      # of Life bar  *  10K\n+     # of fights    *  50K\n+     # of wins      * 100K\n+     # of K.O.      * 250K\n*      (Bonus if Any)\n------------------------------\n                    =  Total\n\nTechnicality.\n1) Life bars does not include halves.  2) Number of fights including UC.\n3) Number of wins including UC.\n\n\nFor the Record\n--------------\nThere is the grand champion which awards you 2 credits.\nThere are the top 4 high scores which awards you 1 credit.\n\nYou can also put your initials for the most jumps in Jump Rope (max 30)* and\nfor the most hits in Speed Bag.  Credit will not be given, but it is just for\nthe record.\n\n*Your initials will be there for doing 30 Jumps and it will stay there until\nsomeone reached that number.\n\nYou can also put your initials if you are Pub Champion.  It will show you what\ndate you did this (1st time). It will remain there until someone else gets it\nno matter how many times you have been Pub Champion under the same initials.\nFor multiple players, the last person who is Pub Champion will get to enter\ntheir initials.  You won't get credit for this, but its there for the time\nbeing.\n\n\nEnd of Game/Match\n=================\n\nYou will see a hand and a punching bag.  The hand will hit the bag until the\nbag is broken off from the top.  If it is a match, you will hear some\ncheering/clapping that you got a free game, otherwise, game ends.\n\n\nStrategy\n========\n\n-Use \"Smart Punch\" only when necessary.  If you are going to defeat the person\n naturally, do so.  Use it in cases where the ball goes all over the place or\n when you opponent has about 4 life bars and you end up SDTM, or one of the\n outlanes.\n\n-Always try to stack multiballs.  You can earn tons of points out of these.\n\n-Normal mode, try to use the left ramp several times to earn jackpots.\n\n-You may use your post towards your advantage when you want to use the\n left/right orbits/scoops.\n\nAnything else??\n\n\nLegal Notice\n----------------------------------\nc. 1998-2000 by Poln and its contributors.

If you have any comments,\nquestions, concerns, etc., please feel free to email me.\n\nSorry, I currently don't have a web page.  Hopefully a site will carry\nthis soon.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nThomas Gradishar  for playing the game, helping with\nvarious things, figuring out the TRUE way to win, telling me about\nRoyal Flush, defeating me a lot, etc.\n\nBill Bumgarner  for helping with regard to the\nChampion Pub glitch...see below under Ultimate Challenge.\n\nMatt Magnasco  for various corrections,\ninfo that I missed, etc.\n\nIsmat  for posting his rulesheet, and thus\ngiving me the incentive I needed to post mine as well.

Designed by Pete\nPiotrowski (most recently famous for co-designing Junkyard), it takes\nall the fun of the Punch-out games for home systems and adds a small\nmetal ball to the mix.\n\nThe setting is a 1920's pub, complete with dancers, beer, and, of\ncourse, bar room fighting.  The boxer system, in my opinion, is one of\nthe more creative ideas I've seen in a recent pinball.  Yes, we've seen\nmany games that focus on hitting the large center target (Attack From\nMars, Medieval Madness, Cirqus Voltaire, etc.), but how often outside\nof a wizard mode setting does the same target fight back?  Complete\nwith over 300 professionally scripted quotes from 11 different\nfighters, this feature provides an amount of depth that makes the game\nmore enjoyable.\n\nCredits:\nDesign - Pete Piotrowski\nSoftware - Dwight Sullivan\nMechanics - Brad Cornell\nSound - Rich Carle\nArt - Paul Barker, Linda Doane\nDot Matrix - Adam Rhine\n\n\t\t\t\tPlayfield\n\t\t\t(clockwise, from center drain)\n\nLeft Flipper - nothing new here.\n\nLeft Slingshot - standard as well.\n\nLeft Inlane - Fairly normal inlane.  Can be lit (light alternates\nbetween inlanes for each slingshot hit) to light jackpot at Right Jab\nfor a few seconds.\n\nLeft Outlane - Nothing interesting, just as avoidable.  Can be lit for\nSecond Wind or KO.\n\nThe Corner - Saucer located at far left shot.  Shots here add 1/2\nhealth to the health bar (1 health during a Fight) and half the default\npurse value to the purse.  Can be lit for Extra Ball, Spitting Gallery,\nPoker Night, Contender/Champion (the name is lit), or Start Fight.\nWhen Ultimate Challenge is available, it lights here, although any Start\nFight will start it.\n\nLeft Jab - In similar position to most loops.  Balls shot here can\ntravel in several ways.  If nothing is lit, during a Fight or during\nContender's Challenge, the ball will travel up a semicircular ramp and\nfollow a habitrail to the left inlane (this is the standard \"Jab\" shot).\nIt can also be an open lane to the back, where a diverter will either\nallow the ball around the loop to the right side (during multiballs) or\nsend it to a pop-up saucer in the back (when Jump Rope or Start Fight is\nlit).  This saucer leads to the Jump Rope.\nCan be lit for Jump Rope, Contender/Champion (the name is lit), Jab\nCombo, or Start Fight.  If it travels around the loop during a multiball,\nit can also collect jackpots lit at Right Jab.\n\nJump Rope - One of the most mechanically intensive parts of the game.\nIt consists of a magnet with a hole in the middle, with a small post\nimbedded within that can raise and lower.  Attached to the back of the\nmachine is a bent bar of metal shaped to resemble a jump rope.  The\npole can raise to make the ball hop over the bar in Jump Rope Mode.\nThis is reached by a pop-up, and will either hold the ball for Start\nFight, be used for Jump Rope mode, or just release the ball.  Balls\nreleased will roll down a path along the left side that becomes a\nhabitrail that serves the left inlane.\n\nBalcony - The only full ramp in the game.  Balls that travel the full\nlength of the ramp will either continue along a habitrail that serves\nthe right inlane (normal), or will be diverted to the Speed Bag in the\nback right corner.  Can be lit for Jackpot, Speed Bag, or Contender/\nChampion (the name is lit).\nIf shot during a Fight, it adds one health to your health meter and half\nthe default purse value to the purse.\n\nLeft Multiplier Target - Between Balcony and Left Hook.  Shots on this\ntarget count toward the multiplier (usually 3 shots necessary to advance).\n\nLeft Hook - Not really a shot, it's basically a short half-ramp (open\non the right side) that curves around to the right and hopefully makes\nthe ball jump to hit the Boxer/Bag near the top for a Head Shot (See Fight).\nCan be lit for KO Boxer and Contender/Champion (the name is lit, but it's\nactually claimed by a Body Blow).\n\nBody Blow - A straight shot to the Boxer/Bag.  Can be lit for Contender/\nChampion (the name is lit), Heavy Bag, Shadow Boxing, or Jackpot.  If not\nlit for Heavy Bag (machine dependent, some machines have it set for when\nHeavy Bag is lit as well), shots spot letters in Barfly Fisticuffs and\noccasionally start a Barfly.\n\nBoxer/Bag - The two-sided main target of the game.  During most of the\ngame, it stays on bag side, and shots are scored as standard Body\nBlows.  During a Fight or Fisticuffs Multiball, the machine rotates to\nreveal a moustached boxer identical to that on the backglass art.  This\nboxer can be hit in the gut or head (Hooks are useful for hitting the\nhead) and can be hit for Jackpot when lit.  It has two operational arms\nthat swing upward as the boxer throws punches.  See Fight for more\ndetails.\n\nRight Hook - Mirror image of the Left Hook.  Can be lit for KO Boxer\nand Contender/Champion (the name is lit, Body Blow claims it).\n\nRight Multiplier Target - Mirror position to the left target, and also\ncounts toward the multiplier advance.\n\nLock - A mechanism that holds up to three balls that enter the top by\nroute of the loop and are ejected by lowering a post.  Ejected balls\nreturn to the right side of the loop.  Holds balls for Start Fight,\nDoor Prize, or locked balls toward a MultiBrawl.\n\nSpeed Bag - A mini-playing field in the back-right corner.  There is a\nbag target in the back, two fists along the bottom, and a metal pin\nbetween the fists.  The fists can move forward and back, allowing the\nball to strike the bag.  Used only for Speed Bag mode.  Balls that\nleave this mode follow the ramp's habitrail to the right inlane.\n\nRight Jab - Very similar to the Left Jab in terms of the diverter.\nBalls either roll up the ramp and return to the right inlane by\nhabitrail (when not lit, during a fight, or during Contender's\nChallenge), travel around the loop (during a multiball), or are\ndiverted to the Lock (when Lock or Start Fight is lit).  Can be lit\nfor Lock, Contender/Champion (the name is lit), Jab Combo, Jackpot,\nor Start Fight.\n\nBeer Standups - Three targets along the right...uh...actually, they\ndon't touch the side at all, they just kinda sit in the middle of\nnowhere (see Against The Ropes to find why).  If all three are\ncompleted before they time out, it adds half the default purse value\nto the purse, adds one health during a fight, and lights Lock if not\nalready lit.\n\nAgainst The Ropes - The newest outlane system since Cirqus Voltaire\nextends halfway up the machine (just below the right loop).  It rests\nBEHIND the beer standups, and is accessable by openings just above and\nbelow the targets.  There is a set of pins that allow the ball to\nbounce around and come out any of four ways: to the left of the right\nslingshot, the right inlane, the right outlane, and back to the ball\nlauncher.  If it goes into the launcher, the machine launches the ball\naround the loop to the left side (or into the Lock if Start Fight or\nLock is lit).\n\nRight Outlane - More interesting due to Against The Ropes, otherwise\nthe same old bad news.  Can be lit for Second Wind or KO.\n\nRight Inlane - Also more interesting due to Against The Ropes.  Can be\nlit to light the Jackpot at the Balcony for a few seconds (alternates\nwith slingshot hits).\n\nRight Slingshot - Not more interesting.  Sorry.\n\nRight Flipper - Standard issue.\n\nBall Saver - This machine goes back to the old system of popping up a\nlarge blockade between the flippers.  This goes up at the beginning of\neach ball and at the beginning of each Fight.  It completely blocks the\ndrain, so the ball easily rolls to the flippers.  However, if the ball\npasses under a flipper and drains while the saver is up, there is no\ncompensation.\nIf a ball drains by outlane while this is up and no Fight is active, a\nnew ball is served to the launcher.\n\nAlso, in the middle of the playfield are a number of lights.  They\ndisplay your health (up to 12), your opponent's health (also up to 12),\nthe five jewels of the Champion Belt, and the Training and Multiballs\ncompleted.\n\n\t\t\t\tObjective\n\nThe objective is to defeat five boxers to achieve the title of Pub\nChampion, and to complete five jewels in the belt to start the Ultimate\nChallenge.  This is not the way to win free games, but this is the\nbasic goal of the machine.\n\nThe five jewels are:\n  Training Complete:  Complete the Speed Bag, Jump Rope, and Heavy Bag.\n  Multiballs Complete:  Play Fisticuffs Multiball, Raid Multiball, and\nMultiBrawl.\n  Pub Champion:  Defeat five boxers.\n  Win by Knockout:  Knock out at least one boxer.\n  Jackpots Complete:  Score a Jackpot Deluxe.\n\nOnce the belt is completed and health is full, shoot any Start Fight to\nstart the Ultimate Challenge!\n\n\t\t\t\tSkill Shot\n\nThe skill shot system for this game is completely different from most\nmachines.  To start the skill shot, press the Launch button and HOLD\nit.  The display scrolls through several choices; release Launch to\ncollect one.\n\nThe choices are:\n  10 - 10 points.  Yay.\n  M - A quick 1M.\n  Fist - Gives one smart punch (see Fighting)\n  2X Purse - Does what it says.  Doubles the purse for the next fight.\n  +5X - Increases the multiplier by 5X.\n  ! - Instant Shadow Boxing (See Shadow Boxing)\n  $ - Lights All Jackpots (See Jackpots)\n  $ door - Door Prize.  Gives a random award (usually a useful one)\nfrom the following:\n    Light Extra Ball\n    Light Spitting Gallery\n    Light Poker Night\n    Light Second Wind\n    Smart Punch (gives you one)\n    Light Lock\n    Six Health (adds six health)\n    Light Start Fight (maxes out your life)\n\n\t\t\t\tFight\n\nThe basis for more than half of the game.  To work toward becoming Pub\nChampion, you must be able to defeat five boxers.\nTo fight:\n  1.  Fill your health completely through training (See Training).\n  2.  Shoot any of the three Start Fight shots (Corner, Left Jab, or\nRight Jab).\n  3.  The game will hold the ball and announce your opponent.  The bag\nrotates to reveal the boxer.\n  4.  The ball is released, and you can begin to fight.\n\nShots that hit the boxer's gut are worth 1 damage and 100K, and shots\nthat hit the head by virtue of a Hook do 2 damage and earn 500K.  Once\n12 damage is done to the opponent, you will have won.\nBe warned, though, you also have a life bar, and your opponent will be\nworking to deplete it.  For every few seconds you don't hit the\nopponent, he will throw punches and knock off anything from 1 to 3 of\nyour 12 life.  Life can be replenished by hitting the Corner, the\nBalcony, or completing the beer standups.  If you run out of life, the\nopponent has won, and you must train again.\nIf you drain or tilt during the fight, you are KOed.  You lose a large\nportion of your life, instantly lose, and the KO is given to the\nopponent's win record.\nWhether you win or lose, every punch delivered to the opponent as he\nspeaks at the end of the match will give you a Sucker Punch bonus of\n500K.\n\nSecond Wind:  This isn't just active during the fight, but the results\nare more apparent then.  If you drain down an outlane with Second Wind\nlit at any time, the ball is returned to play and you gain 3 life.\nSecond Winds are lit by Door Prizes or Shadow Boxing, and alternate\noutlanes with every slingshot hit.\n\nKO-ing the opponent:  If you shoot a Jab shot during the fight, it does\n1 damage to the opponent, unless that 1 damage would defeat him.  It\nalso lights the opposite Jab shot for Jab combo.\nIf you hit the Jab combo shot, the boxer turns to the opposite side and\nthe Hook closest to his head will light for KO Boxer.  If you hit the\nboxer in the head during this time, his life will instantly be depleted,\nscoring you a win and spotting the Knockout Jewel if not spotted\nalready.  For each Knockout you attempt, you will have to shoot one\nmore Jab Combo shot to set up the opponent.\nAlso remember that the opponent is not stunned by Jabs!\n\nSmart Punches:  These can be used during the fight at any time to score\na 2 damage head shot.  They are best used to defeat an opponent when\nyou are about to be KOed, or to count as the head shot required to KO\nthe opponent (!).  Smart Punches are earned by Skill Shot, Door Prize,\nShadow Boxing, 20 Jump Ropes, 20 Speed Bag hits, or the Barfly.\n\nOpponents:  There are 10 standard opponents during the Fight.\nThey are: (name in parentheses is the voice actor)\n  Antonio Jaberini (Rich Carle) - An Italian chef.  His punch speed is\nmoderate, and his punches are powerful.\n  Armando Santiago (Herman Sanchez) - A vengeful Spaniard who seems\nentirely too inspired by The Princess Bride.  He has slightly quick\npunches.\n  Dan Unda (Rich Carle) - An Aussie.  One of the easier fights in my\nopinion.\n  Franz von Pain (Scott Stevenson) - A boring sadistic German.  My\nfavorite opponent, he hits slightly quickly.\n  Knuckles O'Brien (Scott Stevenson) - An Irishman drinker.  He is an\naverage fighter.\n  Master Bim Bam Boom (Jon Hey) - A Japanese martial arts sensei.  He\nhas THE fastest hit rate in the game (he doesn't even fake).  Beware\nhim.\n  Patrotsky Yirbitov (Herman Sanchez) - A Russian.  He is the hardest\nhitter and has fast punches.  He is dangerous.\n  Pierre LePunche (Jon Hey) - Another annoyingly accented Frenchman?\nAnyway, he's not that hard.\n  Sir Winston Pounds (Vince Pontarelli) - A British chap.  He's not the\neasiest fight, but not very hard either.\n  Steveo (Vince Pontarelli) - The American of the main fighters, and\neasily the most controversial.  I won't explain why.  He is a quick\nfighter.\n\nIf you want quotes for these, I have also posted a Quotes List for view.\nIn a later version, I may include it.  Also, if anyone has any other\nthings to add about the fighters, let me know!\n\nWinning:  Once you have defeated a fighter, you receive the purse value\n(equal to 500K times which fighter it is, plus any bonuses you may have\npicked up).  You also get a reward based on which fighter you defeated.\n  1.  Light Spitting Gallery\n  2.  Light Extra Ball\n  3.  Start Raid Multiball\n  4.  Start Contender Challenge\n  5.  Champion Multiball and spot Pub Champion\nOnce you've become Pub Champion, you can enter your initials at the end\nof the game.  No credit is awarded for this.  (If more than one player\nbecomes Pub Champion in a game, the last one to do so enters the\ninitials.)  The machine keeps track of the latest Pub Champion streak\nand starting date.\n\n\t\t\t\tTraining\n\nOther than the fact that you must train to get the health necessary for\nfighting, you also must complete all of the training exercises to spot\nthe Training Jewel.\nOnce you have completed a type of training, you may not train in that\nway again until you have completed them all.\nThere are three basic types of training.\n\n  Heavy Bag:  Hit the punching bag enough times to spot Heavy Bag.  1\nlife a hit at first, then it goes down to 1/2 life later.  Easy, but\nno bonuses.\n\n  Speed Bag:  While it is lit, shoot the Balcony to start Speed Bag.\nFor 5 seconds, you use the flippers to make the fists strike the ball\ninto the punching bag.  Each hit is worth 1 life, then 1/2 life later.\n6 hits will spot Speed Bag.  If you get 10 hits, the purse is doubled,\nand 20 hits will give you a Smart Punch.  Also, if you beat the record\nfor Speed Bag, you get to enter your initials as Speed Bag Champion at\nthe end of the game (no credit, though).\n\n  Jump Rope:  To start, shoot the left jab while it is lit.  Do NOT\nflip until the bar starts turning!  For each time the ball passes over\nthe bar and lands on the magnet, you gain 1 life, then later 1/2 life.\n6 jumps spot Jump Rope, 10 doubles the purse, and 20 gives you a Smart\nPunch.  You can enter your initials as Jump Rope Champ if you beat the\nrecord number (no credit; also, the maximum you can get is 30).\n\n\t\t\t\tMultiballs\n\nTo spot the Multiball jewel, you must complete three multiballs.  Even\nwith this requirement, there is also a one ball mode and another\nmultiball worth mentioning here.\nNote:  All stacked multiballs bring the ball count to 4.\n\nThe required multiballs:\n\n  Fisticuffs Multiball - Start by spotting all of the letters in Barfly\nFisticuffs.  This is done by shooting the bag when it is not lit for\nHeavy Bag.  Once the mode starts, the bag rotates to reveal the Drunk,\nwho will taunt you (voice provided by Scott Stevenson) as you hit him.\nAnother ball is served, and a ball saver (not the ball saver) will be\nin effect for a few seconds.  Every gut shot is worth 100k, and will\nmake the drunk turn to a different direction to set up head shots off\nthe Hook ramps.  Every head shot is worth 500k.\nThis mode is only worth playing when stacked, but it is easy to stack.\nIt can be stacked on MultiBrawl or Raid Multiball.  Plus, you have to\nlove the drunk's lines!\n\n  Raid Multiball - Start by winning your third fight.  Three balls with\nball saver in effect.  Everything scores a value (starts at 1K, goes up\nby 1K every target, up to 50K).  Fisticuffs and MultiBrawl can be\nstacked upon this.\n\n  MultiBrawl - Start by locking three balls or through Poker Night.\nThree balls with ball saver.  Three shots are lit for Jackpots (Balcony,\nBody Blow, and Right Jab).  The shots only relight when all three are\ncompleted.\nThis can be stacked on any other multiball, provided that two balls are\nalready locked when the other multiball starts.  Also, you can stack\nthis upon itself!  If you start MultiBrawl through a Poker Night and\ntwo balls are locked, you can start it again.  However, this does not\nadd to the jackpots.\nThis is also the only multiball that you can stack on Champion\nMultiball.  To stack it on Contender's Challenge, you either need to\njump the ball into the lock or start it through a lit Poker Night.\n\nOther special modes:\n\n  Contender's Challenge:  Start by winning your fourth fight.  Don't\ndrain, there is NO ball saver.  You only have your current ball, and\nall Contender/Champion shots are lit (Corner, Left Jab, Balcony, Left\nHook, Body Blow, Right Hook, Right Jab).  Each is worth a runaway 1M\n(down to 25K, where the mode ends).  Shooting any shot scores the value\nand restarts it at 1M.  If you complete all 7 successfully, your health\nis instantly maxed out and Start Fight is lit.\nBoth Jabs count as jabs during this mode, and Shadow Boxing sometimes\nstarts during this mode WITHOUT any sound or flashing light.  You'll\nknow if it's going as soon as your coach tells you to jab.\nIf a fight or Multibrawl starts during this mode, the mode stops until\nthe fight or Multibrawl is over, then resumes.\n\n  Champion Multiball:  Start by becoming Pub Champion!  This is a four\nball mode with ball saver, which consists of the following:\n    MultiBrawl\n    Fisticuffs Multiball\n    Raid Multiball\n    All Contender/Champion shots worth 1M each\n    Make a Hole in One for Special...oops, sorry, wrong game\nOnce you've lost all but one ball, the multiball ends, although all\nunclaimed jackpots remain lit until claimed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJackpots\n\nThis game has the most absurd Jackpot system in any game I've played.\nJackpots are lit by MultiBrawl, Skill Shot, Poker Night, or by a lit\ninlane.\nThe Jackpot value is only 100K (never since Medieval Madness have\njackpots been worth so little).  What is different in this game is\nthat, for every Jackpot you collect, the jackpot value's multiplier\ngoes up by one.\nEach multiplier has a term that goes with it:\n\n\t 1 - Jackpot\n\t 2 - Double Jackpot\n\t 3 - Triple Jackpot\n\t 4 - Quadruple Jackpot\n\t 5 - Quintuple Jackpot\n\t 6 - Sextuple Jackpot\n\t 7 - Septuple Jackpot\n\t 8 - Octuple Jackpot\n\t 9 - Super Jackpot\n\t10 - Mega Jackpot\n\t11 - Ultra Jackpot\n\t12 - Turbo Jackpot\n\t13 - Maximum Jackpot\n\t14 - Cow of a Jackpot\n\t15 - Jackpot Deluxe\n\nOnce Jackpot Deluxe has been reached, all jackpots are worth 1.5M and\nlight other jackpots as follows:\n\nIf a Jackpot Deluxe is hit at the Balcony, Jackpot Deluxe is lit at the\nBoxer/Bag for a few seconds.\nIf a Jackpot Deluxe is hit at Right Jab, Jackpot Deluxe is lit at the\nBoxer/Bag for a few seconds.\nIf a Jackpot Deluxe is hit at the Boxer/Bag, Jackpot Deluxe is lit at\neither the Balcony or Right Jab (the one that wasn't lit for Jackpot\nDeluxe before the Boxer/Bag).\n\nGetting a Jackpot Deluxe also spots the Jackpot Jewel.\n\n\t\t\tOther things worth mentioning\n\nIn The Corner:\n\n  Extra Ball:  What it sounds like.  Nice subway.  Lit by winning your\nsecond fight, Door Prize, Poker Night, or Shadow Boxing.  Extra Balls\nare also awarded by the Spitting Gallery.\n\n  Spitting Gallery:  This is lit by winning your first fight or by Door\nPrize.  This is a video mode involving a row of six drunks.  You control\na jug with the flippers and maneuver it to catch spit that comes from\nthe drunks.  Extra balls occasionally are mixed in with the standard\nspit.  (Only one can be collected, but if you miss it, the machine will\nsometimes spit out another one.)\nTo win, you must catch 10 spits before you miss 3.\nValue = 2.5M + 250K per catch + 2.5M for finishing + 2.5M for perfect\nUp to 10M available here.\n\n  Poker Night:  This is lit by Shadow Boxing or Door Prize.  You are\ndealt a hand of five cards.  Choose cards to discard with the Launch\nbutton, and discard by hitting both flippers together.  Your hand\ndetermines your prize.\n\n\tHigh Card - Big Points! (250K)\n\tPair - Double Purse Value\n\tTwo Pair - Bonus +5X\n\tThree of a Kind - All Jackpots Lit\n\tStraight - Max Life, Light Start Fight\n\tFlush - Instant Shadow Boxing\n\tFull House - Instant MultiBrawl (it counts toward Jewel)\n\tFour of a Kind - Light Extra Ball\n\tRoyal Flush - Spot Jewel (the far-left unspotted one)\n(If all jewels are already spotted, it gives you an O bonus of 500K)\n\tIs there a straight flush?\n\nOther Modes:\n  Shadow Boxing:  Started by Skill Shot, Poker Night, or by jabs.\nEvery time you shoot a jab when it isn't lit or during Contender's\nChallenge, it counts down one jab.  After a number (default 3), it\nstarts a 200K hurry up.  Boost the value by shooting jabs (200K added\nper jab).  Claim the value by shooting the bag.  Every subsequent\nShadow Boxing starts at 200K more than the previous..  Awards are as\nfollows:\n\tFirst Shadow Boxing - Smart Punch\n\tSecond \"          \" - Light Poker Night\n\tThird  \"          \" - Light Second Wind\n\tFourth \"          \" - Light Extra Ball\nEvery Shadow Boxing after this adds 3 jabs to the requirement and\nrestarts from the top.\n\n  The Barfly:  One of the least known modes of this game.  Sometimes\nwhen you shoot the bag, you can hear an insect buzzing.  When you hear\nit, slap the Launch button.  You will see a graphic of the Barfly (same\nas on backglass), a Bobfly (I'm Crazy Bob!), or a Cowfly (it moos), and\nreceive 100K and a Smart Punch.\n\n\t\t\tThe Ultimate Challenge\n\nThe Wizard Mode of this game.  Once you've completed all five jewels of\nthe belt and maxed out your life, you can shoot a Start Fight shot to\nstart this mode.\n\n  Part 1:  Pugilist A Plenty\nEver notice that, although there are ten boxers, you only get to fight\nfive?  This mode changes that.  You are served all four balls, and THE\nball saver is raised for a short time.  You will fight against the\nremaining five boxers consecutively on a single life bar.  KO is not lit\non the outlanes until all but one of the balls have drained (this mode\ndoesn't end when there is one ball left).  Rules are the same as Fighting\n(restoring life, Smart Punches, etc.)  The purses are initial purse value\n(2.5M + bonuses) +5M per fight.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nIf you lose and have 2 or more balls lit, Fisticuffs Multiball starts.\nThis is the same as before.\nIf there is only one ball left when you lose, the game returns to normal.\n\nIf you win, you go to\n  Part 2:  Victory Multiball (name correct?)\nFlashing shots are worth 5M jackpots (I think).  I'm not sure, I've never\nstuck around this mode long.  I've only seen it twice.\n\nOnce you've drained down to 1 ball or if you won with 1 ball left,\n  Part 3:  Victory Laps (is there even a name?)\nEvery shot to the Balcony is worth 5M.  Continues until you drain.\n\nWARNING:  There is a MASSIVE glitch in many versions (all?) of this\ngame.  If wizard mode ends in any way other than losing with 1 ball\nleft, the game will revert to a \"no-mode\" state.  Nothing will light!\nThe only thing you can do is start and complete Fisticuffs Multiball\nrepeatedly.\nWhat's worse is that this lasts through all the rest of your balls, and\ninto OTHER people's games.  Basically, the game is worthless until the\nproblem is remedied.\nHow to remedy - Turn the machine off and on.  This will reset the modes.\nNo free games will be lost, and all will be well again.\nVery special thanks to Bill Bumgarner for confirming the glitch and\ntelling me how to remedy it!\n\nChampion Pub is different from most pinballs due to the fact that the\ngame does not restart once you complete the wizard mode and let you\nreobtain it.  You don't even have to play the Ultimate Challenge to get\nto the last and highest scoring part of the game.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASH FIGHTS!\n\nEvery fight that you start once you are Pub Champion (either before\nyou spot all of the jewels or after the Ultimate Challenge) is a Cash\nfight.  You bet an amount of your points and choose a fighter based on\nthe bet.  If you win, you win the points AND a 2.5M purse, plus bonuses.\nIf you lose, you LOSE the points.  (No, you cannot go underneath the\nreplay value and win another credit.)\nThe betting system is as follows:\n\nFor under 200M:\n  1st fighter for 1/5 of current score rounded down to nearest 10M\n  2nd fighter for 2/5 \"\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t\t\"\n  3rd fighter for 3/5 \"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"\n  4th fighter for 4/5 \"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"\n  5th fighter for all \"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"\n\nFor over 200M:\n  1st fighter for 80M\n  2nd fighter for 160M\n  3rd fighter for 240M\n  4th fighter for 64M (I think the value reset at 256M, argh)\n  5th fighter for 144M\n\nContrary to popular belief, it seems that the higher ranked fighters are\nno more difficult than the lower ranked fighters during a Cash Fight.\n\n\t\t\t\tBonus\n\nAt the end of each ball, you score the following bonus:\nNumber of health points you have (not counting halves) * 10K\n+ Number of fights (counting each Ultimate Challenge fight) * 50K\n+ Number of wins (counting each Ultimate Challenge win) * 100K\n+ Number of knockouts * 250K\n* multiplier (from hitting Multiplier Targets)\n\n\t\t\t\tStrategy\n\nAs you can see, the way to get those Grand Champion scores is to win a\nlot of Cash Fights.  I have personally obtained scores of about 1.7B\n(ok, not that great).  But you can also LOSE everything you've gotten\n(I've gotten a score of 1.25M once after completing wizard mode).  So\nit's a real gamble, and the only gamble I've ever seen in a pinball\nmachine.  (I'm not a collector.)\nI find the best way to get to Cash Fights without worrying about the\nUltimate Challenge bug is to keep attacking the opponent's body and\nface, and not go for KOs. This will end the fight quickly, save health,\nand prevent gaining the KO jewel needed for Ultimate Challenge.\nHowever, Cash Fights quickly become boring and repetitive.  You may\nwant to get that KO eventually to play the Ultimate Challenge in time.\n\nFor the Skill Shot, I recommend going for the Door Prize each time.\nMost of the bonuses that are given by this (Spitting Gallery, Poker\nNight, Second Wind) only show up once per game or per Shadow Boxing\ngo round otherwise.  The number of Extra Balls and Spitting Galleries\nwill quickly add to your score, and it will also allow you to reach\nfights quickly.\nThe exception to this is if you've gotten the Ultimate Challenge bug.\nIn this case, since you've been in a lot of fights, I recommend getting\nthe +5x for maximum points.\n\nGet those Jackpots early!  It seems redundant to earn Jackpots early on\nwhen there are MultiBrawls and Champion Multiball in the future, but I\nbelieve it is worth it.\nA good MultiBrawl usually consists of about six Jackpots claimed.  At\nthe beginning, this is worth only 2.1M.  But for every Jackpot you've\nalready shot, the amount you get goes up 600K, and it is easy to claim\n9M once Jackpots are completed.\nThe easiest way to get early Jackpots is to exploit the Balcony ramp.  Get\ngood at shooting this ramp if you want to rack up good scores quickly.\n\n\t\t\t\tMiscellaneous\n\nCrazy Bob:  During the attract mode, it credits Jon Hey as performing\nthe voice of Crazy Bob.  However, other than smacking the Bobfly, I\nhaven't seen him anywhere in this game.  Does he show up at all?  Maybe\nin wizard mode?  Or is this a joke based on the fact that Piotrowski\ndesigned Junkyard?\n\nCows:  Two cows in this game, one obvious, one not.\nObvious cow - The 14th collected Jackpot will be \"Cow of a Jackpot!\"\nNot-so-obvious cow - Every once in a while, the Barfly, when swatted,\nwill be a Cowfly (complete with moo).\n\n\t\t\t\tVersion History\n\n1.0 - First version.  No big whoop.\n1.1 - Tweaked a bit.\n1.2 - Confirmed info on Royal Flush in Poker Night, tweaked.\n1.3 - Tweaked some more.  First version posted.\n1.4 - Added comments by other people, added names to the fighter listing,\ndid general fixing and adding of information.\n\nThank you for reading this rulesheet.

No, it doesn't.\"\nRematch:\n\t\"Oh, great joy.  Another round of boredom.\"\n\t\"I have beat you before.  Now I will completely humiliate you.\"\nWhen hit:\n\t\"Ze pain...is intoxicating.\"\n\t\"Harder!\"\n\t\"Ja!  Ja!

Scores 1,030 points.\nEach hit to a slingshot alternates the outlane special and the\nSpin-N-Win value.\nFlippers:  \"Ultimate\" flippers.  These are the Data East\nsolid state flippers.  Basically they are timed for high power,\nthen low power holds the flipper.  There is no EOS switch.\nThese flippers tend to be too\nstrong (even when in need of repair!) and break the drop targets!\nRight inlane:  Scores 20,000 points and lights spinner for\n5,000 points per spin.\nLeft inlane:  Scores 20,000 points and lights Nitro value.\nOutlanes:  Scores \"BIG POINTS\" and 2,000 miles.  Big Points\nis an amount from about 25,000 to 100,000 points (I think it's\n25,000 per ball played).  Also scores Special\nwhen lit (Special alternates between outlanes based on flipper and\nslingshot hits).\nPit Stop:  Saucer just above the left inlane.  Scores 15,000\npoints.  When lit, this\nwill release a ball and start multi-ball.  When not lit to release a\nball it will randomly give an award (see below). \nCARRERA:  Seven drop targets located above the Pit Stop and below\nthe pop bumpers.  Each target is worth 25,000 points.  Completing all\nseven drop targets scores 50,000 points, increases the RPM value,\nand advances the jackpot value on the backbox.\nIt will also score the Blue Light Special if lit (see below).\nSpin-N-Win:  This is the spinner in between the two banks of\ndrop targets.  The spinner scores 1,010 points per spin and the lit\nvalue which is changed by hits to the slingshots and pop bumpers.\nTop Hole:  Hole above the Flat Tire target that feeds the\nupkicker.  Lights a L-A-P lane.\nL-A-P Lanes:  3 top inlanes.  Advances RPM and F-A-S-T when\nflashing.  Lighting L-A-P also advances RPM and F-A-S-T.\nF-A-S-T Lights:  4 lights indicating progression towards FAST mode\n(see below).\nPop Bumpers:  3 located below the L-A-P Lanes.  Each hit scores\n500 points and advances the Nitro Value by 500 points (see nitro\ntarget).  40 (operator adjustable) pop bumper hits advances RPM.\nFlat Tire:  Switch protected by the pop bumpers.  Scores 25,000\npoints and increases pop bumper hits to 1,030 points (which also\nincreases the\nadvance of Nitro Value to 1,030 points!).  The pop bumpers\nwill flash after the Flat Tire target is hit to let you know they now\nscore more points.\nCheckered Flag:  Drop target located just in front of the\nspeed ramp.  It is raised during multi-ball and must be hit\nbefore a jackpot can be scored.\nSpeed Ramp:  This is the only ramp in the game.  It is located\njust to the left of the Checkpoint.  It scores 100 points per MPH\n(ie: 80 MPH = 8,000 points), and lights a country flag.\nWhen all country flags are lit,\nthe ramp is lit for 1 Million points.  When all country flags are lit\nconsecutively (8 ramp shots in a row), the ramp is lit for 10 Million\npoints.  The speed of the ball up the ramp determines the MPH value.\nWhen a certain MPH value\nis exceeded (see display), the RPM is increased.  This ramp also\nscores skill shot, extra ball and jackpot when lit.\nCheckpoint:  This is the rightmost lane that feeds to the\nupkicker.  It releases a ball when lit and lights double\njackpot during multi-ball.  Scores 0 points when not lit.\nNitro Target:  Target under the red Porsche located above the right\nslingshot.  Scores 200,000 points when Hot Nitro is lit, collects pop\nbumper value when blue light below car is lit, otherwise scores\n5,000 points.\n\nRULES\n\n\nCHOOSE MUSIC:\nAt the beginning of the first ball, the player can select\nwhich style of music should be played during the game.\nUse the flippers to select the type within 13 seconds,\nthen plunge the ball to start.  Choices include:\n\nCountry\nRock\nJazz\nRap\nClassical\nSoul\n\nSKILL SHOT:\nPlunge ball.  When the upkicker returns the ball to the left\nflipper, shoot the ramp.  You have 5 seconds to do this, and you must\nnot hit any other target before hitting the ramp.  This scores\n250,000 times the ball in play.  (ie:  250,000 on ball 1; 500,000\non ball 2; and 750,000 on ball 3)\nBALL SAVER:\nHit only 1 or 2 switches, and you will get another ball (and\nanother skill shot!).\nBONUS:\nBonus is the number of miles.  Outlanes score 2,000 miles. \nBONUS MULTIPLIER:\nAdvancing RPMs advances the Bonus Multiplier up to 8X.\nPIT STOP AWARDS:\nRandom awards include:\n\nLight Outlane Special\nLight Extra Ball\nMystery Point Value\nAdvance FAST\nMiles Hold (ie: Bonus Hold)\nIncrease RPM\n\nGENERAL RULES:\nIncrease RPM to start multi-ball.\n\nTO INCREASE RPM:\nRPM can be increased by 1000 several ways.  These include:\n\nPit Stop random awards.\nShooting the spinner when Increase RPM is lit.\nCompleting the LAP lanes.\nCompleting CARRERA drop targets.\n40 (operator adjustable) pop bumper hits.\nQuick shot to the ramp going more than XXX (see display)\nMPH.\n\n\n\n\nMULTIBALL\n\nIncrease RPM to 6000 and shoot the Checkpoint, or increase RPM to\n7000 and shoot either the Checkpoint or the Pit Stop to start 2 ball\nmulti-ball.  Increase the RPM to 8000 to start 3 ball multi-ball\n(RedLine).\n\n2 BALL MULTIBALL:\nShoot Checkpoint or Pit Stop (when lit) to release another\nball and start 3 Ball Multiball (below).\n3 BALL MULTIBALL (RED LINE):\nShoot Checkered Flag single drop target to light jackpot.\nJackpot is lit for about 5 seconds.  Shoot ramp during this time\nto score the Jackpot.\nJackpot value is determined by the flashing light on the backbox.\nJackpot values are 2 Million, 3 Million, and 4 Million.  The\nvalue is advanced by completing the CARRERA drop targets.  Note\nthat if the Jackpot is at 4 Million and you complete the drop\ntargets, the jackpot will move down to 2 Million!  Also,\nshooting Checkpoint when the Jackpot is not lit and when\nall three balls are still in play will\ndouble the jackpot value the next time the jackpot is lit.\nAfter one ball is lost (2 balls in play), shooting the Checkpoint\nwill light Checkpoint (and Pit Stop?) to release another ball.\n\n\nMODES\n\nAll modes are timed.  There is a small timer located on the DMD,\nand when it hits 0:00, it's over.  There's no grace period at all.\nYou know when a mode is going to end, by hearing the ticking sound.  When\nthe ticking sound stops, the mode is over!\n\nFAST:\nTo start fast mode, first complete the LAP lanes which advances\nthe FAST lights.  After FAST is lit, shoot the Checkpoint to\nstart the mode!\nIn this mode, every switch is worth 55,000 points, but mode\nonly lasts for 10 seconds!  So to make it worth your\nwhile, you need to shoot the spinner or the pop bumpers.\nIt also helps to have multi-ball going when this mode starts.\nAll FAST scoring gets added to your score at the end\nof the ball in play, after the bonus is added.\nBLUE LIGHT SPECIAL:\nThis mode randomly appears after you hit down a drop target.\nYou get 10 seconds to hit down the remaining drop targets for\na random award plus 500,000 points.\nThe random awards include:\n\n1 Million Points\nRed Line\nExtra Ball\nTake High Score\nDouble Score\n\n1 MILLION RAMP / 10 MILLION RAMP:\nThe ramp is lit for 10 seconds.  Shooting the ramp scores\n1 or 10 million points (depending on mode).  On some machines\n(operator adjustable) you may be able to repeatedly shoot\nthe ramp for 1 million each shot for 10 seconds.  The 10 Million\nshot can not be repeatedly shot for 10 Million points.\nHOT NITRO ROUND\nThis round is active while the yellow Hot Nitro light\nis lit.  During this round, the Nitro Target scores 200,000\npoints, and 20 MPH are added to all ramp shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Checkpoint", "manufacturer": "Data East", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/checkpoint.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Checkpoint", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

INTRODUCTION\n   ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n0.0.  This is my first rulesheet ever.  If you notice anything omitted\n      or incorrect, or are wondering what causes X to happen on the game,\n      _please_ email me.  I wrote most of the rulesheet and compiled all of\n      it, but other credits also belong to:\n\n        * Scott Piehler (rosco29@mindspring.com)\n        * Dave Grossman (tfth@j51.com)\n        * David Gersic (dgersic@niu.edu)\n        * PMM (whoever he is), RWC, and the rest of the guys who play pinball\n          at the Georgia Tech Student Center\n        * Jef Lepine (jlepine@ops.tiac.net)\n        * Bowen Kerins (bowenk@ix.netcom.com)\n        * John Zmaczynski (jjz@tezcat.com)\n        * Cameron Silver (cameron@theramp.net)\n        * Chris Kelly (chris@fiendation.com)\n        * Brian Dominy (pinball@mediaone.net)\n        * Jonathan Deitch (litz@bellsouth.net)\n        * Mark Phaedrus (phaedrus@mail1.halcyon.com)\n        * Keefer Johnson (keefer@access.digex.net)\n        * Mike :FX: Morrey (email?)\n        * Louis Solomon (email?)\n        * Haroldr2 (psu19257@odin.cc.pdx.edu)\n        * Michael Dunn (mdunn@inreach.com)\n\n     Each of these people has contributed some data toward the rulesheet;\n     it's only fair that they get credit for their work.  I originally\n     wrote this rulesheet in November of 1997; I will continually add to\n     and correct this rulesheet until I have covered every aspect of it there\n     is.  Okay, so, in this instance I'm being a perfectionist.  Sue me.\n\n0.1. CIRQUS VOLTAIRE is Bally/Williams' newest pinball game. It was designed by\n     one of Williams' best designers (IMHO), John Popadiuk. John brought us\n     such great games as World Cup Soccer, Theatre of Magic, and Tales of\n     the Arabian Nights.  This is his newest creation.\n\n     BTW, his name, according to Scott Piehler, is pronounced\n     /pop' a duke/, not /pop a die' uck/\n\n0.2. This game features *8*, yes, EIGHT, multiballs plus a multi-stage wizard\n     mode with *its* own multiballs. At least three different multiballs may be\n     stacked simultaneously, in which case the jackpots get *really* big.\n\n0.3. I really like this game.  From the obnoxious colors, to the full-sized\n     backglass, to the unique inlane/outlane area, this game is unique.\n     IMHO, I feel it is a fusion of AFM, Scared Stiff, and Theatre of\n     Magic.  See if you agree.\n\n0.4. This game has an automanual plunger, so both physical and virtual locks\n     are possible.  This is a much-needed modernization to John's\n     previous games.\n\n0.5.

PLAYFIELD LAYOUT\n   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGoing clockwise from the center drain:\n\n* Left flipper.  Standard.\n\n* Left slingshot.  Narrower than usual, to accommodate for the left \"inlane\".\n\n* Left \"inlane\".  This is not your typical inlane.  Instead of being clearly\n  divided by a wireform, it is an area the size of an inlane and outlane com-\n  bined.  Where the wireform would normally curve to feed the flipper is a\n  post. There are two other posts to set the size of the \"outlane\".  All\n  in all, there is a *lot* of rubber in this area; according to Scott\n  Piehler, this game is ideal for learning how to nudge a pinball machine.\n\n  Here's a picture, in all of its ASCII-art glory:\n\n  ]\n  ]                     0. Wall\n  ]       |\\            1. Adjustable post to set the outlane width\n  ]       | \\           2. Permanent post\n0 ]|      |  \\          3. Outlane\n  ]|      |   \\         4.

Slingshot\n  ]|      |     \\\n  ]   *2  |      \\\n  ]   |   |       \\\n   \\   \\   \\       \\\n    \\ 3 \\ 4 \\       \\\n     \\   \\   \\\n\n  Normally, there would be a wireform extending most of the way up from\n  the #2 post to the top of the slingshot.  Instead, this area is one big,\n  open space.\n\n* Menagerie.  In about the same spot as the MAR martian in AFM is a large cage\n  with a racquetball ball trapped inside.  It takes the term \"captive ball\" to\n  a new dimension.  Adjacent to the wall is a swtich which scores the\n  menagerie.  If this switch, which looks like a slingshot but isn't, is\n  broken, the left inlane and outlane will compensate.\n\n  Also used to increase the bonus X.\n\n* White standup.  Used to award rings, counted toward the Bonus X, and\n  award hits on the Menagerie.\n\n* Left loop.  Feeds the juggler and side show.  Awards the extra ball.\n  One of the jackpots during Highwire Multiball.\n\n* Left ramp.  Used for locking balls, starting Highwire multiball,\n  spotting marvels, and starting Strike-an-arc multiball.\n\n* 2 standups on either side of the left ramp.  LIGHT and LOCK respectively.\n  Can you guess what they do?\n\n* Lock queue (Highwire).  Parallels the left ramp.  Where locked balls go.  Wea\nk\n  shots up the ramp and lucky flings of the Ringmaster magnet may send balls in\n  here when the lock is not lit, and a \"sneaky lock\" (with a ball\n  tiptoeing across the DMD) is then awarded.  If the \"sneaky lock\" would be\n  lock 3, Highwire multiball starts.  Officially called the Highwire by\n  Williams.\n\n* Juggler Drain #1.  One of two drains from the juggler locks, drains\n  second juggler ball.\n\n* Magnet.  Ideally, it catches balls to lock them in the juggler for juggler MB\n  or for awarding extra balls.\n\n* 2 saucers.  Ball locks for juggler multiball.  There is no \"sneaky\n  lock\" analogue for the Juggler, however, shooting a \"sneaky lock\" into\n  the Juggler will award the Sideshow (q.v.) if lit.\n\n* Secret Passage lane.  Awards nothing; feeds the left Juggler lock.\n\n* Backward-facing-and-hidden scoop.  Diverts balls to the side show.\n  Used for starting the Sideshow and starting wizard mode.\n\n* Skill shot target.  A sideways-facing target used for the skill shot.\n  Worth 200k x # of successful skill shots (200k, 400k, 600k, etc.).\n  The skill shot maxes at 1,000,000 points; each addition skill shot\n  will award 1M plus the comment, \"Show-off.\"\n\n* Juggler drain #2.  Drain used for releasing juggler ball #1.\n\n* Ringmaster loop.  It's the same loop that's on Theatre of Magic but only\n  on the right side of the playfield.  Used to light the spin marvel.  One\n  of the jackpots during Highwire Multiball.  Weak counterclockwise\n  shots may drain SDTM.\n\n* Hidden Ringmaster.  The main toy of the game.  Normally recessed\n  beneath the playfield.  The idea for the ringmaster, IMHO, was taken\n  directly from AFM's saucers or MM's castles.  Hit the ringmaster 6 times\n  to allow you to blow him up.  Any Ringmaster you defeat after the\n  first one will start a 2-ball multiball.\n\n* 2 yellow \"Ballyhoo\" standups.  Used to light the side show, and to award\n  hits on the ringmaster when up.\n\n* WOW targets.  Spell W-O-W to raise up a Ringmaster.  Each target does\n  not have to be hit individually (like WhoDunnit, unlike AFM).  Also\n  used in Neon Multiball.\n\n* Right ramp.  Used to light the acrobat marvel.  Strong shots feed the left\n  flipper, weak shots dribble out in the 2nd juggler drain.  One of the\n  jackpots for Highwire Multiball.\n\n* Right loop.  Feeds the right ramp\n\n* Suspended (elevated from playfield) magnet.  Diverts balls to the lock\n  queue.\n\n* Neon habitrail.  Feeds the right flipper from non-ball-locking shots\n  to the lock (left) ramp.  Paralleling it is a neon tube.  Pictures and\n  flyers have shown this tube to glow a greenish-blue, but on the game I\n  play, it's orange.  According to Williams, the colors of the tube and\n  the color of the Menagerie ball are random.\n\n* Hidden BOOM baloon.  A recessed jet bumper that becomes activated during\n  the Boom! marvel.  Hit it enough times while it's up (~10 sec) for an extra\n  ball.\n\n* 2 other jet bumpers.  Between them and the boom bumper, they form the stan-\n  dard triangle.  Used for bumping up (no pun intended) the Boom! value;\n  each hit raises the Boom! value by 5000 points.\n\n* Right inlane, slingshot, and flipper.  Same as on the left.\n\n  The right inlane *briefly* (2-3 sec) lights the left ramp for \"spot marvel\".\n  Only one marvel may be spotted per ball.\n\n* Both outlanes.  Always lit is the alternating \"Load Cannon\" light.  Tripping\n  its switch (lit cannon alternates each flipper hit) awards a random amount\n  of points and 1 cannon ball.  Points range from 1000 to 4M points.\n  Load Cannon is not available during a multiball.\n\nOther stuff not on the playfield:\n\n* Dot Matrix.  In the playfield area (protected by some thick\n  plexiglass) as opposed to on the backglass.\n\n* Backglass.  Full-sized, as there is no DMD.  Following a recent\n  mini-trend of interactive backboxes on Williams games (Scared Stiff,\n  NBA Fastbreak, Safecracker), there is an orange cannonball in it.  The\n  cannon fires:\n  * whenever you complete a marvel\n  * during Cannonball Run\n  * whenever the Boom! bumper is hit\n  * When the Load Cannon switch is tripped\n  * After getting a jackpot in any multiball\n\n============================================================================\n\n2.  OBJECTIVE\n    ~~~~~~~~~\n\nYour task is to complete all 9 marvels to join the Cirqus.  Once you complete\nthat, a multi-level wizard mode automatically begins.\n\nTo join the cirqus, you have to get all of these marvels, in any order:\n\n1. Juggler\n2. Acrobats\n3. Ringmaster Frenzie\n4. Defeat all Ringmasters\n5. Spin\n6. Boom!\n7. Menagerie\n8. Highwire Multiball\n9. Side Show\n\n2.1. Juggler.  Shoot the left loop 3 times to light the Juggler, and three more\n     times to lock three balls and start juggler multiball.  The jackpots are\n     worth 500k.  If you can shoot two balls into the juggler within\n     about a 10-second period, you'll get a 1M double jackpot.  If you can\n     shoot a third ball in there within another 10 seconds, you'll get a 2M\n     super jackpot.  If you fail to get the double and/or super jackpot\n     within the allotted time, all balls are ejected from the juggler\n     locks and the jackpot value resets to 500k.  Spotting this marvel\n     does not start Juggler Multiball\n\n2.2. Acrobats.  Shoot the right ramp 4 times.  Shots do *not* need to go\n     around the full length of the ramp.  As long as they make it up about\n     the first four inches or so of the ramp, the switch will trip and\n     score an acrobat.  Completing the acrobats will light Super Spinner\n     on both spinners, where each spin is worth 10k.  The switch is\n     mounted at the beginning of the ramp, flush with a wall, so, more often\n     than not, you'll score acrobats with incomplete ramp shots.  The switch\n     will score from either direction.  Spotting this marvel will light\n     super spinner on both spinners as well.\n\n\n2.3. Ringmaster Frenzie (RMF).  Play the multiball associated with defeating\n     Ringmaster #2.  RMF is a 2-ball multiball and the ringmaster raises himsel\nf\n     up a few inches to allow access to the hole.  Each shot to the ringmaster\n     during RMF awards 250,000 points.\n\n     If you have can hit the ringmaster in QUICK succession, you will get\n     a larger award: If you can get one in then another you get 250k +\n     500k. It seems if you have a 4 ball multiball, it's quite easy to get\n     the 500k jackpot often, sometimes even 750k or 1M.  \"Quickly\" is defined a\ns\n     \"while the jackpot animation is playing, and for an infinitesimal amount\n     of time thereafter.\"\n\n2.4. Defeat all ringmasters.  Defeat 4 Ringmasters, playing Frenzie, Razz, and\n     Special multiballs.  Spell WOW to raise up each Ringmaster, and then hit\n     each one five times to defeat each one. The two standups on either side\n     of the Ringmaster will spot hits on him.  To raise the first\n     Ringmaster only requires one hit on any of the WOW targets; all\n     other Ringmasters require 3 hits (any target is okay).\n\n     Defeating the first Ringmaster awards 1M, the second awards 2M,\n     the third awards 3M, etc.  Once you have completed Ringmaster\n     Battle (see section), you cannot defeat another Ringmaster until after\n     you have played Join the Cirqus (the wizard mode; see section).\n     Once you have played Join the Cirqus, the first ringmaster you defeat\n     will start Ringmaster Frenzie.  The next starts Razz, etc.\n\n     After spelling WOW, a magnet built into the Ringmaster's head will catch\n     the ball, hold it while the Ringmaster taunts you, and then randomly fling\n     it around the playfield.  There *is* a ballsaver after each fling,\n     lest the Ringmaster fling the ball SDTM.  If he flings it onto the lock\n     queue, the game will award a \"sneaky lock\".  Unfortunately, a more\n     common occurence is that the Ringmaster will weakly fling the ball off,\n     and it will end up sandwiched between the back of the Ringmaster and the\n     WOW targets.  This problem should resolve itself after one ball search.\n\n     NOTE: A ball will frequently get trapped behind the left standup and next\n     to the Ringmaster.  Semi-vigorous shaking will free the trapped ball, as\n     will waiting for the ball search *and* giving the game a gentle nudge for-\n     ward.  Method 2 has an advantage in that it will award a Ringmaster's Hide\n-\n     out, worth 100k.\n\n     There are two models of the Ringmaster: the thin one and the fat\n     one.  The thin one was Williams' original model; to solve the\n     ball-trapping problem Williams made him fat.  Balls will still get\n     trapped with the fat Ringmaster, although supposedly less often than\n     with the thin Ringmaster.  Nevertheless, even with the fat\n     Ringmaster balls get stuck there all the time.  Williams has created a\n     service pack which will resolve this problem, as well as two other\n     locations where balls get trapped.  See the Williams tech support page\n     for more info.  Actually, even *with* the service pack, some balls\n     still get wedged in between the Ringmaster and the standup.\n\n2.5. Spin.  Shoot the inner loop (the one surrounding the Ringmaster) four\n     times to spell S-P-I-N.  On prototype versions this marvel is called\n     the Crank, and is awarded slightly differently.  \"Spin\" requires four\n     *consecutive* spins of the spinner.  Once the ball has gone through\n     the loop, you have about two seconds to send it through again to\n     complete the remaining spin(s).  The spinner itself does not award\n     the spins; the two rollover switches in the loop do.  Consequently,\n     incomplete shots may award letters, much like how incomplete shots to\n     the right ramp may award acrobats.\n\n2.6. Boom!.  Spell V-O-L-T by rolling over the red rollovers (a la WCS) to\n     charge up the Boom! balloon.  I believe that you either need to roll over\n     each rollover once or roll over only the lit rollovers to spell V-O-L-T.\n     The ballon/bumper is raised for about 10 seconds (the timer stops if the\n     ball is temporarily out of play by being in the side show, on the Ring-\n     master's magnet, etc.), and if you hit it enough times, you'll light an\n     extra ball.  The Boom! EB count is cumulative, per player, throughout the\n     game (e.g., Boom! one yields 6 hits, and Boom! two yields 12 hits.  You\n     have 18 hits toward an EB).  Each subsequent raising of the Boom!\n     bumper requires spelling V-O-L-T multiple times.\n\n2.7. Menagerie.\n     To the left of the racquetball ball's cage is a pseudo-slingshot.\n     Hit it enough times, or the white standup just above the cage, to spot\n     hits toward the menagerie.  It awards different things at different\n     levels, and the idea was taken from Pat Lawlor.  After shooting the\n     requisite shots to award the Menagerie marvel, the next level is spot\n     marvel, then light extra ball, etc.  Think of what Bear Kicks, Robots,\n     Blasts, etc., award from your favorite Pat Lawlor game and you get the\n     idea of the Menagerie.  Don't hold your breath trying to get the\n     Menagerie extra ball.  From what I have seen, the awards are:\n\n                1.  Award Menagerie\n                2.  Spot Marvel\n                3.  Light EB\n                4.  Spot Marvel\n                5.  Spot Marvel\n                6.  Big Points  (see \"Bugs\")\n\n      Regardless of what the next award should be, the first award after\n      having completing wizard mode will ALWAYS be Award Menagerie.\n\n2.8. Highwire Multiball.  Lock three balls on the left ramp queue by hitting\n     the LIGHT and LOCK standups.  Once one lock has been lit, hitting the\n     targets again will light another lock.  IOW, lit locks may be stacked.\n     However, only for the first multiball may locks be stacked.\n     Multiballs two and higher require that each lock be lit individually,\n     and the number of times you have to hit the LIGHT and LOCK standups\n     increases as well.  Jackpots are worth 1M and are the Juggler,\n     Acrobats, and Ringmaster loop.  The Ringmaster loop jackpot ONLY\n     scores from the left entrance to the loop.\n\n     After a few jackpots, however, the jackpots will start moving, so\n     that you don't sit and exploit the Ringmaster loop.\n\n     Spotting this marvel does not start Highwire Multiball.\n\n2.9. Side show.  After hitting the yellow Ringmaster standups enough times,\n     the Side Show becomes lit just past the Juggler magnet.  This is the\n     equivalent of the Stroke of Luck in AFM, and it awards:\n\n     * The Amazing Roonie  (video mode)\n     * Cannonball Run\n     * Popcorn Mania\n     * Neon Multiball\n     * Big Points: 500k\n     * Big Points: 250k\n     * Go For the Hat Trick\n     * Light Spot Marvel\n     * Light Lock\n     * Extra Ball\n\n     The Sideshow is lit at the beginning of the game, and is re-lit\n     after every 5-6 hits on the yellow BallyHoo targets on either side\n     of the Ringmaster.\n\n     2.9a.  Video Mode:  Roonie is a kangaroo, and you need to jump over\n                         objects just like on Dr. Who.  It is 20 seconds\n                         long, and you have to survive all 20 seconds of\n                         it.  Unlike in Dr. Who, though, Roonie has only\n                         one size of jump (long), instead of Dr. Who's\n                         short and long.\n\n                         Completing video mode awards a total of 2.9M.\n                         Each jump is worth about 180k, and there is a 1M\n                         bonus for successfully completing it.  If\n                         Roonie falls down, there is only a 100k bonus\n                         (in addition to all previous successful jumps,\n                         of course.)\n\n                         Video mode is extremely boring, and not worth\n                         much.  There is no extra ball available.  Also,\n                         there is a display bug where a '3' might be an\n                         object for Roonie to jump over.  Like in AFM\n                         and ST:TNG, the '3' scores nothing and, for all\n                         intents and purposes, is invisible to the game.\n\n     2.9b.  Cannonball Run:  Fire the cannon in the backbox.  You have\n                             10 seconds to fire as many cannonballs as\n                             possible, and those which make it to the top\n                             \"Cirqus Luck\" switch are worth an additional\n                             per hit, so the first Cirqus Luck is 250k,\n                             the second is 500k, etc.  I don't think\n                             that there is any skill involved in\n                             shooting the cannonball, so don't be disappointed\n                             if you don't get any Cirqus Luck.  Expect\n                             to be able to fire a cannonball about once\n                             every 2-3 seconds.\n\n                             Cannonballs fired during this round do NOT\n                             count in the game total.  This is not a\n                             bug, either (ask voltaire@wms.com why).\n\n     2.9c.  Popcorn Mania:   Each switch scores 30,000 points.  After\n                             enough switch hits, the DMD will fill up with\n                             popcorn and then award a Popcorn Jackpot.  Go\n                             for those spinners and jet bumpers!\n                             Popcorn jackpots start at 500k and increase by\n                             100k each time.\n\n                             This mode, if started, is active during any\n                             multiball(s).  There is a 20-second timer.\n\n     2.9d.  Neon Multiball:  Taken verbatim from AFM's strobe multiball.  The\n                             neon tube paralleling the right habitrail is the\n                             only thing lit, and you have a 3-ball multiball to\n                             hit the WOW targets (any one will do) 10 times to\n                             light an extra ball.  There is an average-length\n                             ballsaver at the beginning (~6-7 sec), and a short\n                             ballsaver at the end -- taken directly from\n                             Strobe.\n\n                             The next award, at 20 hits, is a puny 1M.\n\n     2.9e.  Big Points:      Self-explanatory.  Worth 500k or 250k.\n\n     2.9f.  Hat Trick:       The Ringmaster will raise up to his full height\n                             and your task is to shoot three balls into\n                             him within 20 seconds.  Shots 1 and 2 are\n                             each worth 500k, and shot 3 (the Hat Trick) is\n                             worth 1M.  During Hat Trick, you can not\n                             hit nor defeat the Ringmaster.\n\n                             This mode, if started, is active during any\n                             multiball(s).  There is a 20-second timer.\n\n     2.9g.  Light Spot Marvel:  Lights Spot Marvel permanently on the\n                                lock ramp (lit until collected).\n\n     2.9h.  Light Lock:      Ooh, a toughie.\n\n     2.9i.  Extra Ball:      Another toughie.  (Note: I have never seen\n                             this award; the Cirqus Voltaire web page claims\n                             it exists.)\n\n============================================================================\n\n3.  MULTIBALLS\n    ~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs I stated before, this game has eight multiballs, plus an additional\nfour from wizard mode.  The eight are:\n\n* Juggler\n* Highwire\n* RM Frenzie\n* RM Razz\n* RM Special\n* RM Battle\n* Neon\n* Strike-an-Arc.\n\nUp to three multiballs may occur concurrently.  The flyer says that\nthere are only six; Williams counts all four Ringmaster multiballs and\nall four wizard-mode multiballs collectively as two.\n\n3.1: Ringmaster Razz and Ringmaster Special (RMR and RMS)\n\nRM Razz is like RM Frenzie, except that the jackpots are worth at least\n250k and there is an extra ball lit.  RM Special is, anticlimactically, nothing\nspecial.  There is *no* special (unlike its name implies), and jackpots are\nworth at least 500k.\n\nThe jackpots in RMR are a hurry-up.  When you first start RMR, the\nRingmaster is lit for a 500k hurry-up, which counts down to 250k relatively\nslowly.  Whenever you stop the hurry-up (250k if it times out) is the\njackpot value.  Jackpots are increased in RMS by shooting the spinner;\nonce the ball falls under the Ringmaster, however, the jackpot can not\nbe increased further.  During RMS, the Ringmaster will inch his way up;\nto get him to full height requires about four or five hits.  Double, triple,\nand quadruple jackpots are also possible in both RMR and RMS as they were in\nRMF.\n\n3.2. Ringmaster Battle (RMB)\n\nRM Battle occurs when you defeat the 5th ringmaster.  First of all, it is\nnot marked on the playfield, unlike Frenzie, Razz, and Special, so you have to\nknow it exists.  Once you defeat the 5th Ringmaster, another ball is kicked\ninto play, and your task is to defeat the Ringmaster.  I'm not sure, but I\nthink this MB requires about 15 to 20 hits on the Ringmaster to ultimately\ndefeat him (you don't need the final, under-the-playfield shot however).\nThere is a short ballsaver.  Once the ballsaver times out and a ball\ndrains, however, RM Battle does *not* end.  Instead, the ball is\nre-served into play, but as a penalty, the Ringmaster grows stronger, and\nyou have re-weaken the Ringmaster.  Upon defeating the Ringmaster, the DMD\nwill go crazy (a la Scared Stiff), the game will award you 10M points, and\nlight an extra ball.  If/when you defeat the Ringmaster, the flippers will\nautomatically go dead and both balls will drain.\n\nHaving both balls in play -- i.e., not having one trapped in the Sideshow\nor behid the Ringmaster -- is essential to defeating the Ringmaster.\nAfter about 5 seconds of not hitting the Ringmaster, he will take away\nyour most recent hit.  After another 5 or so seconds, he'll take away\nanother hit, etc.  If he takes away enough points, you will lose.\nIf and when you lose, you have to start all over again with Ringmaster\nFrenzie.  If you win, you cannot defeat another Ringmaster until you\nhave played Join the Cirqus; if you lose, you can keep defeating\nRingmasters until you beat him.\n\nOTOH, if you want to rack up the score, parking a ball/getting a ball\ntrapped is the way to go, and then just go against the Ringmaster\none-on-one, and if he takes away hits, who cares?  Just make sure that you\nhit the Ringmaster often enough to keep yourself from losing!  Including\nthe 10M completion bonus, I scored about 50-60M just on Ringmaster Battle\nby getting a ball trapped.  Eventually, after about 15 or 20 minutes,\nthe Ringmaster will give up and won't take away any more hits.  At this\npoint, you are guaranteed to defeat the Ringmaster.\n\nCompleting RMB will award about 50M:\n        * 5M for starting RMB\n        * 10M for completing it\n        * About (varies on your skill of battle) 35M in the actual\n          battle.\n\nHits on the Ringmaster during RMB score 1M each.\n\nAn extra ball is available after *every* RMB victory.\n\nIf you start another multiball prior to starting RMB multiball, the\nRingmaster will recess back into his hole when he would normally raise\nhimself up for the \"blow-up\" shot.  Starting RMB is then delayed until\nafter the present multiball(s) is(are) complete.  In other words, the\nRingmaster Battle multiball is not stackable.\n\nRingmaster Battle takes precedence over everything else; nothing else\noccurs. In other words, once you start Ringmaster Battle, nothing else may\nstart until you have defeated the Ringmaster.  RMB may only be started if\nthe \"Defeat All Ringmasters\" marvel is not the last one to be completed,\nbecause if it is, the game will automatically begin wizard mode without\ngiving you a chance to pound away on the Ringmaster.  If you are\nbattling the Ringmaster and you spot the last remaining marvel (which would\nnormally start wizard mode), wizard mode does not start until RMB is\nover.  However, if you are still in the \"hit the Ringmaster 5 times\"\nstage -- i.e., you have _not_ started the Battle itself -- and you do\nspot the last remaining marvel, Join the Cirqus wizard mode\nautomatically starts, the Ringmaster goes back into his hole, and you\nstart over (provided you've completed wizard mode) at Ringmaster\nFrenzie.\n\nThe logic for RMB has been rewritten in v1.3 ROM's.  The Ringmaster is\nMUCH tougher to beat, and he takes away hits at Warp Factor 9.  So if\nyour game has 1.3 ROM's, expect _not_ to be able to defeat the\nRingmaster in Ringmaster Battle.  This accomplishes two things: one, it\nprevents you from just abusing the Ringmaster for 1M/hit, and makes RMB\nmore of a wizard mode than the wizard mode!\n\n\n3.3. Strike-an-Arc\n\nStrike-an-Arc occurs after shooting the the left ramp enough times.  It is\na 2-ball frenzy; jackpots are awarded after enough switch hits.  Each\nswitch hit helps charge up an arc by a few percentage points, and at\n100%, ZAP!  Jackpot!  Jackpots start at 500k and increase by 100k for each\nadditional jackpot, like during No Limits on No Fear or Total Annihilation on\nAFM.  Keefer says, \"As far as I can tell, each switch adds 10% to the\ncharge  for the first jackpot, and this value decreases by 1% each jackpot\ndown to as low as 4% (requiring 25 switches for a jackpot).\"  Since it\nwill take more and more switch hits to strike the arc (get a jackpot),\nthe way to exploit this round is to shoot for the spinners!\n\nStrike-an-Arc is available multiple times during the game if you keep\nlooping the ramp.  Balls which are locked toward Highwire Multiball\ncount toward starting Strike-an-Arc.  Each successive multiball requires\n5 more ramp loops than the previous one (ie, S-a-A #1 requires 5, S-a-A\n#2 requires 10, etc.)  The ramp count resets to 0 after starting every\nStrike-an-Arc.\n\n3.4. Neon\n\nNeon MB is stackable with Juggler Multiball if and only if Juggler lock\n#3 is lit and the Sideshow awards Neon MB.\n\nNeon and a Ringmaster multiball, Highwire multiball, and/or Strike-an-Arc\nmultball are mutually exclusive.\n\n3.5. Concurrent Multiballs\n\nJuggler and Highwire MB are 3-ball mutlbialls, and the Ringmaster MB's are\n2-ball.  Strike-an-Arc is also a 2-ball.  Stacking any of them yields a\n4-ball multiball, with a fresh ballsaver. By all means, try to stack your\nmultiballs!  Getting twenty or even forty million just off stacked\nmultiballs is not uncommon.\n\nHere are the combinations for stacking multiballs:\n(given in the order required to stack them)\n\n{disclaimer: these are what I've seen on my machine, so YMMV}\n* Juggler, Strike-an-Arc, Ringmaster\n* Highwire, Strike-an-Arc, Ringmaster\n* Juggler, Ringmaster\n* Highwire, Ringmaster\n* Strike-an-Arc, Ringmaster\n* Highwire, Strike-an-Arc\n* Neon, Juggler (rare but it happens)\n\nOnly Ringmaster Frenzie, Razz, and Special may be stacked.  Ringmaster\nBattle may not.\n\nStacking Highwire and Strike-An-Arc can occur if and only if the act of\nlocking ball three would normally start Strike-an-Arc as well.  Again,\nif the Ringmaster multiball is Battle, it will be delayed until the\ncurrent multiball(s) end.  Upon starting Battle, the current\nmultiball(s) will run concurrently with Battle, and there will be four\nballs in play.\n\n3.6. Voltaire's Multiple Jackpots\n\nIf you have concurrent multiballs, shooting the lock ramp will\naward \"Voltaire's Multiple Jackpots\", which will award 1 jackpot from\n*each* active multiball.  This award is available only after the\nconcurrent multiballs have ended, i.e., during the 3-4 second \"grace\nperiod\" immediately after multiball.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n4. WIZARD MODE: Join the Cirqus\n   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMuch like on John's previous game Tales of the Arabian Nights, Cirqus\nVoltaire also has a multi-leveled wizard mode.  There are five levels of\nwizard mode, in contrast to TOTAN's two.  After you complete each level,\nall balls drain or go out of play, the flippers go dead, etc., telling\nyou that you have advanced to the next level and giving you a chance to\nwatch the DMD's animations.  Seeing what is on the DMD is very\nimportant here, and with it on the playfield, seeing what shots need to\nbe shot (especially during the \"Spell Cirqus\" and \"Meet the Cirqus\"\nlevels) is fairly easy.\n\nThere is no \"You Rule the Universe\"-type animation after completing the\nlast level.\n\n4.1. Level 0: Start Wizard Mode\n\nShoot either the left (Juggler) or right (Acrobat) loop.  The diverter\non the acrobat loop will open and feed the juggler.  Starting Join the\nCirqus requires a ball to be *physically* locked in the Sideshow, so if\nyour game's Sideshow post is broken, you'll need to shake the machine in\nhopes of getting the ball to land in the Sideshow.\n\n4.2. Level 1: Spell Cirqus\n\n3-ball multiball with a 20-second ballsaver.\n\nSpell C-I-R-Q-U-S by shooting the Menagerie, the Juggler, the lock ramp,\nthe Ringmaster loop, the WOW targets behind the Ringmaster, and the\nAcrobats, in any order.\n\nSuccessfully completing this level awards 10M points.\n\n\n4.3. Level 2: Unmask Voltaire\n\n3-ball multiball with a 20-second ballsaver.\n\nShoot the Ringmaster and then shoot the lock ramp.  Repeat three more\ntimes, and then shoot the Ringmaster one last time.  In short, you have\nto shoot the Ringmaster five times and the lock ramp 4 times,\nalternating after each shot.\n\nSuccessfully completing this level awards another 10M points.\n\n\n4.4. Level 3: Meet the Cirqus\n\nInitially 1 ball.  Shoot jackpots to add more balls (up to 3).  A short\nballsaver is lit during the first few seconds of every plunge of a fresh\nball.\n\nMake 6 jackpots.  They are the same jackpots as in Highwire Multiball\n(Juggler, Acrobat, Ringmaster loop).  Jackpots are random.\n\nSuccessfully completing this level awards yet another 10M points.\n\n\n4.5. Level 4: Party Multiball\n\nA 4-ball multiball where both ramps, the Juggler, the Ringmaster, and the\nRingmaster loop all score 1M jackpots.  The 3 jet bumpers score the Boom!\nvalue. This mode is a lot like Monster Multiball on Scared Stiff.  There\nis a short ballsaver in the beginning.\n\nThis round continues as long as there are at least two balls in play.\nWarning!  When ball three drains, *you are still playing the game*.  It\nis not like on WCS or TOTAN where the flippers die if you lose;\nconversely, there is nothing to win, so, like I said, there is no \"You\nRule the Universe!\"-esque lauding.\n\nThe person whose Party Multiball score is the highest gets to enter\ntheir initials as the party champion.\n\n\n4.6. Wizard-mode Multiballs don't end when the third ball drains!\n\nFor at least Levels 1, 2, & 3, once three balls drain and the ballsaver has\ntimed out does *not* end the wizard mode.  It continues with only one\nball.  Especially for Level 2, I think playing with 1 ball instead of 4 is\npreferable.  So if you see ball 3 draining, don't panic.  You'll still\ncontinue the wizard mode with a monoball, ball 4.\n\nThat is true only on production ROM's (v1.0 and higher).  For beta ROM's,\nit's different: Mark Phaedrus says, \"On the local machine [Seattle], it\nworks like this: When you're down to one ball, a timer counts down from\n10.  (It stays at 0 for a few seconds when it gets there, and there's a\ngrace period even after that, so the timer is actually at least 15\nseconds.) The timer resets to 10 every time you do something that makes\nprogress towards completing the level. (On Level 1, it resets whenever you\nshoot a new Cirqus shot; on Level 2, whenever you hit the lit Ringmaster\nor ramp; etc.)\"  {Ed. note: At which point, pretend you're playing Royal\nMadness on Medieval Madness}\n\n\n4.7. Member of the Cirqus\n\nWhen the game ends, you get to enter your initials as having joined the\ncirqus if you made it to at least level 1 wizard mode.\n\n============================================================================\n\n5. EXTRA BALLS\n   ~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Ringmaster Razz (once per game) [1]\n* After about 50 hits on the Menagerie (presumably once per game)\n* After 10 WOW hits in Neon Multiball (once per game)\n* After 15 hits on the Boom! jet bumper (once per game)\n* After defeating the Ringmaster in Ringmaster Battle (available after\n  every defeat)\n* As an award from the Sideshow\n\n[1] If the machine is set to 5-ball play, the Ringmaster extra ball is lit\nduring Ringmaster Special instead of Razz.\n\n============================================================================\n\n6. FUN WITH BONUS\n   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBonus is the sum total of:\n   * # of Perfect Scores (10-10-10 from the three judges), worth 500k\n     each\n   * # of cannonballs x 20k\n   * 50k x the judges' average\n\nAll times the bonus X.\n\nThere are three judges' awards: for the Ringmaster, for Juggler\nMultiball, and for Highwire Multiball.  The Ringmaster judges' award is\nusually given; The Highwire and Juggler judges are awarded only on the ball\nin which that (those) multiball(s) occurs.  The perfect-10 bonus is only\navailable on the ball in which the perfect 10's were awarded.\n\nThe bonus X is increased by getting rings.  Spell \"RING\" to increase the\nbonus X, up to 4X.  \"RING\" is spelled by hitting the Menagerie twice (R\nand I) and the red standup just above the right slingshot (N and G).\nOnce you spell RING, all ring lights unlight and you can begin the\nprocess anew.  Even with the 4X max bonus X, I've seen boni over 10M\nbefore.  Why can you only increase the bonus X three times?  Because\nit's a three-ring cirqus!\n\nThere are many judges, including all of the design team for Cirqus\nVoltaire (\"John\", \"Cameron\", \"Adam\", etc.).  The design-team judges tend\nto be stingy with their scores, while the DOHO and Hefer judges tend to be very\nliberal.  Other judges to look out for:\n\n0110011 (or whatever the sequence is)\nMarvin  (the AFM Martian, not the Warner Bros.)\nTommy the Ticket\nTommy the Pinball Wizard (wearing a mask and sunglasses)\nA duck (forget his name)\nHefer (a cow...see below)\nRincewind\nA cat (forget his name)\n\nMarvin is the stingiest judge around.  I've had games where two judges\nhave given me 9's and 10's, while Marvin has only awarded 6's.\n\nGetting Highwire multiball + another multiball and/or Juggler multiball\n+ another multiball will almost guarantee perfect 10's from those\njudges.\n\n\n============================================================================\n\n7. BUGS\n   ~~~~\n\nNote: this is not a complete listing of all the bugs.  These are only\nthe ones that I have seen.  For a listing of what bugs the various ROM\nrevisions have corrected, please go to Williams' tech support page at\nhttp://www.pinball.wms.com/tech/wpcroms.html\n\n\n--  MAJOR BUG: If you're playing a multiplayer game, your game may DISAPPEAR.\nIf your score doesn't disappear altogether, it may reset to some amount much\nless than what you should normally have.  Fixed in ROM v1.1.\n\nI was playing with Chris, Brian, and Jonathan, and I had scored several\nmillion on my first two balls.  When I got up to play my ball 3, my score\nwas 60,030.  I shot the skill shot and it awarded 400k, so, at the very\nminimum, my score should have been 200k.  Several games later, after\nJonathan played his ball 3, Brian's and my scores *disappeared entirely*!\nThe game had no record whatsoever that we had played.  Jonathan's score,\nBTW, was also severely munged as well, as he finished the game with an\nalleged 5M, when it should have been about 20M.  Jonathan had started\nJuggler Multiball, and, well after starting Juggler, he shot the lock\nramp, and the game awarded him Highwire as well (lock 3 was lit prior to\nstarting Juggler).  Go figure.\n\n-- If you tilt during Ringmaster Battle, the game will infinitely autoplunge\n   balls.  Fixed in ROM v1.3.\n\n-- If you stack Neon and Juggler multiballs, you will not receive credit\n   for completing the Juggler marvel.  Fixed in ROM v1.3.\n\n-- If the Boom! balloon is active for the first time, and you spot your\n   first marvel during the Boom! round, the marvel spotted will be Boom!.\n   AFAICT, re-spotting Boom! only resets the Boom! timer to 10.  Fixed\n   in ROM v1.3.\n\n-- (NEW) MAJOR BUG: At 200 menagerie hits, the game power cycles\n   instead of awarding Big Points.  To be fixed in ROM v1.4.\n\n===========================================================================\n\n8. NOTES, COMMENTARY, AND OTHER STUFF\n   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Q1: Why did I just shoot the loops to start wizard mode, but the game is\n      still saying to shoot the loops?\n  Q2: Juggler lock 3 is lit, and I shot the Juggler, but Juggler Multiball\n      didn't start.  Why?\n\n  A: I emailed voltaire@wms.com those same questions, and here is Cameron\n     Silver's (the software designer for CV) response, quoted with\n     permission.\n\n\"I think what your seeing is Juggler multiball ready at the same time as\nthe Side Show is lit. The loop will not start juggler multiball until after\nthe side-show, so it relies on the ball making it into the trough [the\nSideshow/Ringmaster under-the-playfield trough, not the\nend-of-ball-storage trough], running the side-show, then starting the\nmultiball. If the post doesn't divert the ball correctly, then the\nside-show never starts, and the multiball doesn't happen.\n\n\"What I think might be happening in your case is that the POST is not\nworking as well as it should be. When the final mode is ready, (and\nside-show, extra ball etc) the post pops up and diverts the ball behind\nthe display. The shot is only considered 'made' when the ball is IN the\ntrough, as all those shows require that the ball is held. I can't do them\nwhile the ball is in play, so I can't spot them if the post is not\nworking..\"\n\nIn other words, the ball must be stopped, either in the Juggler or in the\nSideshow for all of the animations to start.\n\nStrangely, if you backhand the Juggler, the ball will almost undoubtedly\nend up in the Sideshow.  So if you're good at backhands....\n\n* Cows:\n\n        Oy!  Are there plenty!\n\n        * Roonie jumps over several in video mode\n        * A judge in Fun With Bonus (Hefer)\n        * Something the original performers in the REAL Cirqus Voltaire\n          hurled  (yeah...uh-huh...)  [2]\n        * Something in the ancient Roman circus which ate fire\n          (yeah...uh-huh...) [2]\n        * A moo occasionally can be heard whenever you hit the Ringmaster\n        * Occasionally seen behind the 1's digit \"0\" as it turns around on\n          the DMD\n        * One of the animals printed on the backglass, just above the\n          right acrobat (see below for more)\n\n[2] only visible in the attract mode spiel about the history of the\n    circus.\n\n* There are two ways to display scores in this game.  The first is the\nstandard 9-digit format (e.g., 256,486,190).  The second is to display 8\ndigits and use a series of bars to display the hundred millions' digit,\nas in:\n        [100M] [100M]\n        56,486,190\n\n* In addition to the standard high scores, you can enter your initials\n  for:\n        * Joining the Cirqus (starting level 1 wizard mode)\n        * Being Party Champion\n        * Being Cannonball Champion (like Martian Champ on AFM)\n\nBeing Cannonball champ may or may not award a free credit (my CV, which I\nthink is set to \"easy\", awards a credit; your mileage may vary).\n\n* If the game goes into ball-search mode, after about 4 or 5\nunsuccessful searches it will eject a ball from the lock (either the\nHighwire lock or the Juggler lock; the game will warn where the ball is\nbeing kicked out from), if there is one in there.  The idea is that by\nputting this ball into play, it will eventually collide with the stuck\nball and unstick it.  If this ball drains, and the ball is still not\nunstuck, the game will release another ball from the lock, if available.\nThis is one place where Sega machines beat Williams machines hands-down:\non a Sega machine, after 4-5 unsuccessful ball searches, it flags the ball\nas missing and serves a new one to the plunger, as opposed to Williams\ngames which will usually ball-search for a l-o-n-g, l-o-n-g time.\n\nI have seen balls get stuck *everywhere* on this game.  I've even had\nballs carom off posts *into* the Ringmaster/Sideshow kickout!\n\n* Semi-hidden DMD secret: occasionally the 1's digit will flip around\n  revealing a skull or a cow.  I think it just happens randomly.\n\n* If you get three of the marvel lights in a line, the game will light\n  the corresponding Cirqus letter.  Consequently, if and when you complete\n  all the marvels, all six letters will be lit.\n\n* The acrobat on the backglass who looks like Fabio is John Popadiuk\n  himself.\n\n* Williams has named the Ringmaster \"Jack.\"  There's something I\n  must be missing, as I don't get the joke.  A \"Jack\"-in-the-box,\n  perhaps?\n\n* There is no physical replay knocker in this game.  So free credits\n  have a Sega-like electronic \"toink!\" instead of the classic \"Thwack!\"\n\n* If you match, the clown will give you a thumbs-up.\n\n* If you don't enter any initials for the high-score board or having\n  joined the cirqus, the game will default to the initials of the game's\n  programmer, Cameron J. Silver (CJS).\n\n=========================================================================\n\n9. STRATEGY\n\n* Go for Ringmaster Battle, and keep it going for a l-o-n-g time.\n\n* Get the Boom! value up high, especially if you're coming close to\n  Party Multiball.  In my 80M Party Multiball game, my jet bumpers\n  scored 605k each -- almost as much as a Ringmaster or loop jackpot (1M).\n\n* Try to stack as many multiballs as possible.\n\n* Don't worry about boosting the bonus X; getting a multiball or two\n  will do it naturally.\n\n* For some reason, I don't feel like extra balls are really that\n  important to this game.  Don't get me wrong; get as many EB's as you\n  can, of course, but they're not necessary to making it to wizard mode.\n  IMHO, this game has one of the most accessible and easy-to-get-to wizard\n  modes around.  I've made it to wizard mode before on ball 1!  Games like\n  Twilight Zone, AFM, and Medieval Madness make getting EB's vital; CV,\n  for some reason, doesn't give me that same sense of urgency.  Go figure.\n\n* Learn to backhand the juggler if/when your Sideshow diverter is\n  broken.\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "CIRQUS VOLTAIRE", "manufacturer": "Bally/Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/cirqusvoltaire.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

It is a good Family Game\nRoom addition. Comet is the hit of every\nparty I have. It has a fun and fairly\neasy Rule Set and can be enjoyed by just about everyone, although drinking\nmoderately seems to help one's gratification with playing the game and its\nassociated frustrations. \nNOTE: These rules are compiled from hours of playing of\n\"Comet\" and are as accurate as possible to the author's best\nknowledge.\nNew\nto this version\n\nFixed some typos.\nSpecial\nThanks\nTo\nWilliams Electronics for giving us so many Great Pinball Machines!\nComet\nGeneral Description\nThe Comet was\nmanufactured by Williams Electronics (System 9), in June 1985 (1985-06)\nwith a model designation of 540.\n\n Main CPU: M6808 @ 1 MHz\n Sound CPU: M6808 @ 1 MHz\n Sound chips: DAC, HC55516\n\n\n Designed by: Barry Oursler (Comet is Barry's 17th design effort at Williams)\n Art by:  Python Anghelo (Comet is Python's 1st art effort at Williams)\n Software by:  Bill Pfutzenreuter (Comet is Bill's 2nd S/W effort at Williams)\n\nComet is a 4 Player,\nSolid-State (SS) Electronic pinball machine of which 8,100 units were produced. Its theme is Happiness/Circus/Carnival. It has 2 flippers, 3 Pop Bumpers, 1-drop\ntarget, 3 Ramps, 2 Eject Holes, a 4 Duck target bank and a 4 Rabbit target bank.\nAccording to the book\nArcade Treasures, 'Comet' was named after a popular ride at Chicago's\nnow-closed Riverview Amusement Park. It was\nthe first solid-state machine to feature a one million point shot. \nPython Anghelo has said that he thinks that Comet is one of his best efforts.\nThe voice announcing \"One Million!\"\nis said to belong to Steve Kordek. Kordek became something of a figurehead for pinball having\ndesigned almost 100 games at Genco and then at Williams where he\nheaded-up the pinball design section. Since the closure of the Williams pinball\ndivision, he has been working on archiving the large number of historic\ndocuments and designs.\nSTARTING\nTHE GAME\nOne to four players can\nplay. New players can enter the game by pressing START until the end of the\nball of the last player. After that, pressing START aborts the current game for\nall players and begins a new one. \nOBJECT\nOF THE GAME, SCORE 1,000,000\nOne object is to light\nthe 1-9-8-6 rollover targets on the last ball (the 3rd or 5th\nball, depending on your set up) and shoot the ball up the Cycle Jump, while it's\nlit, and land in the Upper Ring scoring 1,000,000 points.\nTHE\nBALL DIDN'T REACH THE TOP DURING LAUNCH\nA launched ball that\nscores no points before draining will be re-served. This can only happen when the ball doesn't\nreach the top when launched and drains back onto the playfield.\nPLAYFIELD LAYOUT\nStarting from the lower\nplayfield and working up here is a description of the Playfield and Game:\nFlippers: There\nare 2 of them, located just above the Outhole. There is a small post with a\nrubber O-Ring in between the flippers.\nThere is a \"Ride Again\" light at the Outhole.\nLeft Hand Return lane: It\nis normal size, for games of that time. The left return lane lights the Cycle\nJump Ramp. There is no right hand\nReturn Lane.\nOutlanes: Both of\nthe Outlanes have \"SPECIAL\" lights on them. The Left Outlane advances the Duck bonus by 3\nand the Right Outlane advances the Rabbit bonus by 3. The left Outlane can also return the ball to\nthe playfield if the ball hits the Outlane bumper in the right place, English\nhelps here. Both Outlanes activate the\nTrain Whistle when the ball drains... you'll learn to hate that sound.\nDuck targets: Just above the left outlane are 4 Duck targets\nand hitting all four lights the Corkscrew. \nRabbit targets: Just above the right outlane are 4 Rabbit targets\nand hitting all four lights the Funhouse.\nComet ramp: Right in\nthe middle of the playfield is a ramp. This is the Comet ramp, and it returns\nthe ball to the lower right playfield. You can re-light it, activating larger\nscoring potential, by hitting all of both the Duck & Rabbit targets to the\nleft and right of the playfield. If you do not hit the ball hard enough to make\nit all the way around, it will fall back down onto the center of the playfield\nand sometimes even SDTM (Straight Down the Middle). \nFunhouse: Just to\nthe right of the Comet ramp, there is an Eject hole, called the Funhouse.\nCycle Jump Ramp: In the\nupper right corner of the playfield, above the Funhouse, is the Cycle ramp. \nPop Bumpers: 3 of\nthem, just below the top rollover lanes and behind the Comet ramp. \nCorkscrew Ramp: In the\nupper left corner of the playfield is the Corkscrew ramp.\nTOP LANES 1-9-8-6: At the top center are\nthe 1-9-8-6 rollover lanes.\nBackglass: Comet\nhas nice artwork. There is a roller coaster (The Comet) with John Belushi in\nthe back seat and Jane Curtin in the second row on the left; well it sure looks\nlike them!\nSound: This game has average\nsound effects for it's time. The game has some speech too. The attract\nmode is very well synchronized, in terms of sound, and lights.\nDisplays: Comet\nwas back in the time of alphanumeric displays. The highest score that the high\nscore table will hold is 9,999,999. \nMiscellaneous: Comet\nhas many options that can be adjusted by the operator, including the length of\ncertain timers. With that in mind, the settings on the machine you choose to play\nmay vary and for that reason, I did not put many of the timer values in here; most\nof the features time-out in 15 to 20 seconds.\nThe game's electronic adjustments are detailed in the Owners Manual on\npages 6 & 7.\nPLAYFIELD\nADJUSTMENTS\nThe playfield has a few physical adjustments that\nchange the difficulty of game play: playfield pitch, playfield level & post\nposition. While these are discussed on\npages 8 & 9 of the Owners Manual, I'll highlight them here.\nPlayfield Pitch & Level are set by the front and\nrear leg levelers on the bottom of the machines legs. The nominal pitch (front to back) setting\nshould be about 6 degrees. The playfield should be level (side to side) when\nmeasured at both the top and bottom areas of the playfield.\nThere are 5 posts at the Return lane and the\nOutlanes that can be adjusted. These\nadjustments make the game play \"conservative\" (easier to lose the ball) to\n\"liberal\" (more difficult to lose the ball).\nIn general, opening up the Return lane makes the game more liberal\n(harder to lose the ball) and opening up the Outlanes makes the game more\nconservative (easier to lose the ball).\nThese adjustments are detailed on page 8 of the Owners Manual.\nGAME\nPLAY\nOne should start out\nwith the skill shot, shooting the ball into the area above the rollover lane\nand allowing it to pass thru one of the lanes. From there, the ball goes into\nthe Pop Bumpers, and can come out either side of the Comet ramp. If you shoot the ball too hard, the ball will\njust exit the rollover lanes area, via the Corkscrew, and head towards the\nflippers. \nTOP LANES 1-9-8-6: Making (lighting) the\n1-9-8-6 at the rollover lanes...\nscores 50,000 and lights the playfield multiplier\nfor a 20-second interval (x2, x3 x5).\nRolling over the lanes to light them scores 1000.\nThe following Playfield\nMultiplier (Red playfield light)\nscoring can occur, if you light all of the Rollover lanes on that\nball (5-ball setting):\n1st\nBall: 2x; 2nd Ball: 3x; 3rd Ball: 2x; 4th\nBall: 2x; 5th Ball: 5x\nThe following Playfield\nMultiplier (Red playfield light)\nscoring can occur, if you light all of the Rollover lanes on that\nball (3-ball setting):\n1st\nBall: 2x; 2nd Ball: 3x; 3rd Ball: 5x\nThe right flipper button\nchanges which of the 1-9-8-6 are lit (Lane Change) and its use is key to\nlighting all of 1-9-8-6.\nDUNK THE DUMMY: Hitting\nthe \"DUMMY\" drop target exposes the bull's-eye for a timed interval. Hitting bull's-eye, before the drop target\nresets, advances bonus multiplier (Green playfield light):\n1st time: 2x; 2nd time: 3x, 3rd time:\n4x; 4th time: 5x... thereafter, hits score 20,000 for each additional\ntime. Hitting the \"DUMMY\" activates a\ngame voice.\nDuck Target Bank: Making\nthe 4 Duck Bank... lights CORKSCREW. \nCORKSCREW: Ride the\nCorkscrew to collect the DUCK Bonus, an EXTRA BALL or SPECIAL, when lit.\nRabbit Target Bank: Making\nthe 4 Rabbit Bank... lights FUNHOUSE.\nFUNHOUSE: Drop\ninto the Funhouse (Eject hole) to collect the RABBIT Bonus, when lit.\nCOMET RIDE:\nCompleting BOTH the Duck & Rabbit Banks... activates (lights) the COMET\nramp for higher scores, EXTRA BALLS and SPECIALS. \"Riding\" the COMET scores 10,000 when not\nlit. When lit, it scores 30,000 and then\nadvances scoring to 50,000. The 2nd\nCOMET ride scores 50,000, then advances scoring to 100,000. The 3rd COMET ride scores 100,000\nand some playfield EXTRA BALL. The 4th\nCOMET ride also scores 100,000 and some playfield SPECIAL. Each scoring advance must be achieved within\nits time limit, or the scoring advance resets either back to 30,000 or if the 1st\n100,000 has been scored, the lights go out.\nAlso, completing all 4 \"Rides\" resets it, and turns off the lights. BOTH the Duck & Rabbit Banks must be\nre-completed to re-light the Comet Ride.\nCYCLE JUMP & Playfield Multiplier: Landing in the Lower Ring scores 10,000 (or 20,000\nwhen lit). Landing in the Center Ring\nscores 20,000 (or 50,000 when lit).\nLanding in the Upper Ring scores 30,000 (or 200,000 when lit). Passage thru the LEFT Flipper return lights\nall three rings. On the last ball, if\nthe 5x Playfield Multiplier is lit, landing in the Upper Ring scores 1,000,000. On the last ball with the Ramp lit and the\n1-9-8-6 rollover lanes activated, until the 5x bonus times out the machine\nshouts \"A Million\". Once the ball goes\nup the Ramp into the eject hole, or goes into its eject hole from a Pop Bumper\n(it's just to the right of the lower right Pop Bumper), the Jump is reset and\nthe ball must go thru the left return lane to re-light the Cycle Jump Ramp.\nCYCLE JUMP & Extra Ball: Completing BOTH the Duck & Rabbit Banks a\n2nd time... lights more playfield EXTRA Ball's & SPECIAL's and also\nactivates the Cycle Jump for EXTRA BALL action:\n(A) Lights Lower Cycle Jump Ring for 5 seconds; (B) Then, lights Center\nRing for 10 seconds; (C) Finally, The Upper Ring lights for 15 seconds. If the EXTRA BALL is not made within the specified\ntime(s), the sequence starts over until an EXTRA BALL is made. Then BOTH the Duck & Rabbit Banks must be\nre-completed to re-light the EXTRA BALL.\nCORKSCREW & Special:\nCompleting\nBOTH the Duck & Rabbit Banks a 3rd time- lights more playfield\nEXTRA Ball's & SPECIAL's. \"Ride\" the\nCorkscrew to score the SPECIAL or the EXTRA BALL, when lit.\nGeneral Playfield Points: The\nfollowing is in addition to the scoring shown above. The Left\n Return Lane scores 5,000. The left and right Outlanes score 10,000. The left Outlane scores the Duck Bonus and\nthe right Outlane scores the Rabbit Bonus.\nHitting the Ducks and Rabbits scores 2,000 the first time and 1,000\nafter that. The Funhouse scores 10,000,\nthe COMET ramp (unlit) 10,000. The\nCorkscrew scores 20,000. The 3 Pop Bumpers\nscore 1000 per activation.\nGame\nQuotes\n\n*\u00a0\nTurkey, c'mon get me.\n*\u00a0\nTurkey\n*\u00a0\nHey\nTurkey\n*\u00a0\nHit\nme\n*\u00a0\nHey\n(train whistle) Ah-h-h (laugh)\n*\u00a0\n(Roller\ncoaster Sound) Splash (laugh)\n*\u00a0\nA\nMillion\n*\u00a0\nHey\nTurkey,\nHit me\n*\u00a0\nHa\nha ha ha\n\nOther Sounds\nThe game plays this\naddictive music that gets stuck in your head!\nWhen a ball has scored a large amount of points, the machine\nawards you with flashing backglass lights and the sounds of fireworks;\nand if you score the 1,000,000 point shot, the machine also flashes\nall the machine's lights and makes more fireworks and roller coaster\nsounds.\nThe train whistle (left & right Outlanes) and the Cycle Jump Ramp\ndrum roll are equally annoyingly cool sounds!

Baltimore League, where Congo was one of our first machines.\nThanks to the Congo at Towson State University for being the guinea\npig.\nSpecial Thanks to Dan Yochelson and Dustin Manning who helped to go\nthrough the machine and take notes on details.\nA massive overhaul of this rulessheet was provided to me by Roland\nJoyal, Jr. from Herndon, VA. <flipperpro_@_aol.com> (Remove _'s)\nAdditional Input from RGP folks:\n\n\nKarl Brostrom\n\nChristian Magnusson\n\nRodney\n\nJim Schelberg\n\nDavid Gersic\n\n\nRecent Changes\n\n\n\n\n0.1: 4/15/96: Document Born\n\n0.2: Various improvements including formatting.\n\n0.9: 4/19/96: Much input received and research done but still MANY unknowns.\n\n1.0: 6/16/99: Roland sent me extensive revisions that have enabled this\nrulesheet to be just about as complete as it can get.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nCongo is based on the movie of the same name. This machine is notorious\nfor being released so far after the movie release it was almost on video.\nI haven't seen the movie yet but a friend who plays it did and she said\nit does a good job of reflecting the movie. I personally feel that this\nis a very good machine. It may not be exciting to wizards but it is fair\n(unlike most recent Williams/Bally machines) in that it is not a drain\nhog (unless your saucer kicks are misaligned) and is not really bouncy\nor have post-cluttered shots. Overall I give it a B+. It would get an A-\nif it didn't have the sticky flipper syndrome. A special note of interest\nfrom Jim Schelberg (pinGame Journal): Congo marks the end of pinball production\nat the Williams California Avenue plant. That same plant was also home\nto the very first Williams game, Suspense. The production space is now\nfilled slot machines :-( Games after Congo are being built in the new facility\nin north-east Illinois. The design teams, administration and the construction\nof the first few test games are still there, but most everything else pinball\nis gone. :-(((((\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nRent the movie...\n\n\nPlayfield\n\n\nHere's the various playfield parts, starting from the plunger lane and\nworking clockwise. (* = Diamond Shots, explained later)\n\n\nPlunger\n\nDual plunger; the manual plunger is used for skill shots, and an autoplunger\nis also there for ballsavers and Multiballs.\n\nRight Outlane\n\nLights a ZINJ letter if not lit. Tucked away in such a way that a ball\nthat gets in here does NOT come back out!\n\nInlanes\n\nLights a ZINJ letter if not lit.\n\nFlippers\n\nThe usual two, in the usual places. No center post. Congo suffers badly\nfrom the \"sticky flipper syndrome\".\n\nSlingshots\n\nStandard, just like the flippers.\n\nLeft Outlane\n\nKickback here, also your target for a super skill shot. Kickback active\nfor super skill even if not lit and it is not used up when \"autofire\" (aka\nballsaver) is active.\n\nKickback Targets\n\nThree targets. Light all to activate kickback. If kickback is lit, you\ncan accumulate targets towards next kickback, but targets unlight when\ncompleted.\n\nUpper Flipper\n\nStandard size\n\nLeft Orbit *\n\nFeeds to rollovers, lock, and extra ball collection. A post is here that\nholds the ball in the lane for certain modes.\n\nLeft Ramp *\n\nCollects M-A-P letters. Each score 1,001,000. (First switch scores the\nthousand, second switch scores the million). Ball normally fed to\nright inlane except when MAP completed, ball is diverted to left flipper\nto set up shot to MAP saucer.\n\nGRAY Lane *\n\nCollects G-R-A-Y letters. Each score 5M. When completed, ball is held in\nleft orbit while you play the lower playfield. See GRAY Attack below.\n\nSatellite Targets\n\nTwo targets, scoring is complicated: 3 different values. After both targets\nare completed 4 times, Satellite Transfer begins (see below).\n\nRollovers and AMY Saucer *\n\n3 rollovers labelled A-M-Y. Standard flipper cycling of lit lanes. Completing\nAMY adds 1x bonus and starts Amy mode (see below). Ball drops in saucer\nbelow rollovers and is fed into pop bumpers or backwards along the gorilla's\narm to left orbit during Amy mode.\n\nLock\n\nPast the rollovers is a lock that opens at the appropriate time to lock\nball.\n\nUpper Upper Orbit *\n\nFeeds to saucer under rollovers. Can be lit for Mine Hunt, used to score\nAmy (double scoring), or super jackpot during Volcano Multiball\n\nUpper Orbit *\n\nCan be lit for lock (fed to same lock area as above) or looped for 5M+5M\na loop.\n\nBumpers\n\nA triangular pattern of three bumpers, in the middle right of the playfield;\nfed from the AMY saucer or from the right orbit. Each hit adds a H-I-P-P-O\nletter in the HIPPO lane which adds 1M to the HIPPO bonus when completed,\nthen letters reset to be completed again. HIPPO bonus is collected if the\nball falls through a lane on the far right edge and back out to the playfield,\nor triple bonus collected at volcano ramp. Hippo bonus resets to\nzero after collecting it by both methods.\n\nVolcano Ramp *\n\nAccessed via lane through pop bumpers. Each ramp scores 10,001,000 plus\n3x HIPPO Bonus or adds 1M to HIPPO bonus if at 0M. 3 ramps to light extra\nball at this ramp (this value reflexes over time or can be set to a fixed\nvalue depending on operator setting). Subsequent extra balls lit at 55(!)\nramps. Balls for multiball kicked out of volcano. Ramp feeds right inlane.\n\nHIPPO Lane\n\nAs described above in Pop Bumpers.\n\nMAP Saucer *\n\nCollects MAP award, collects Jungle/Ghost Tribe/Super Multiball Jackpots,\nand starts Skill Fire when appropriately lit.\n\nMystery Saucer *\n\nCollects Mystery (complete ZINJ to light), starts Video Mode, or collects\nGhost Tribe/Super Multiball Jackpots.\n\nPerimeter Defense Target and the rubber ring to the left of the map saucer.\n\nAwards 5M when lit by GRAY lane. Increases 1M per hit.\n\nHieroglyphic Targets\n\nAccumulate 3 pieces of a picture that says \"We are watching you\". Complete\nall 3 targets to start picture and all 3 targets 4 more times to complete\n(total of 5 completions of 3 targets). When completed, it lights Video\nMode.\n\n\n\nGeneral Rules\n\n\nNovice/expert mode is available if operator setting is on. Tournament mode\ncan be started by holding both flippers a few seconds before starting (see\nbelow for specifics).\nBuy In is disabled in default settings, otherwise you can buy up to\n1,2,3,unlimited extra balls depending on operator setting (one credit each);\nthere is a separate buy-in high score board but only records/displays top\nTWO scores, not four! Separate Diamond Champ display for most diamonds\ncollected, although not a separate one for buy-ins.\nSoftware Changes: None known at this time...\nIn general, CONGO is a simple game and probably \"the best DE/Sega game\nWilliams ever made\". I agree with that statement. It plays a lot like a\nDE game and the rules are similar. I think it is most like Jurassic Park.\nGenerally you collect letters all over the place, start modes, and collect\ndiamonds.\n\n\nSkill Shot\n\n\nShoot the kickback targets for standard skill shot. Awards: 10M+5M (for\ngame) if lit target hit. If all are flashing, score a fixed 10M. The cycling\nof lights speeds up as more skill shots are collected. Super skill shot\nis shot into the left outlane for 25M. If you are lucky, you can get the\nKickback Combo out of it.\nNOTE: If you don't hit any switches, ball saver is not activated and\nyou get another free shot, so let it drain! If you do hit a switch, ball\nsaver is activated (but skill shots are still active if only a slingshot\nis hit!), so play the ball and take a shot at the skill shot if you want.\nSkill shots are active any time the ball is delivered to the plunger after\na lock as well. Note some locks do cause a ball to be kicked out of the\nvolcano if it is full from previous player locks.\n\n\nCollecting Diamonds\n\n\nOne of the game objectives is to collect diamonds. Number of diamonds required\nfor each lock at each multiball level is 4, 8, 12, ... Diamonds are collected\neither by making lit diamond shots or by completing various objectives.\nDiamond shots are re-lit when all are completed (if operator setting is\nset for this - it is by default) or via other awards (e.g. MAP, Mystery,\nMine Shaft, etc...). The bottom\ntwo saucers (when not lit for diamond) will re-lite one random diamond\nshot. Completing certain modes can give diamond rewards (e.g. AMY\nmode, GRAY Attack, etc.). Once you collect 100 diamonds you start the Super\nMultiball. Each additional 100 diamonds award additional Super Multiballs.\n\n\nSuper Multiball\n\n\nThis is the wizard mode: All balls ejected (4) with lower playfield active.\nJackpots at ramps and lower saucers for 10M. Super Jackpot for defeating\ngorilla in lower playfield for 50M, however CONGO letters only stay lit\nfor about 5 seconds once they are hit so you have to act fast to complete\nthem all. Relight Super Jackpot by scoring a Jackpot. Mode ends when one\nball remains.\n\n\nCombos\n\n\n\n\nM-A-P Completed in a Row: 20M\n\nKickback to Mystery Saucer: 5M\n\nLoop Combo: GRAY Lane -> Upper Orbit: 20M\n\nGRAY Lane to Perimeter Defense target: 5M\n\nUpper Loop repeat: 5M+5M for each loop\n\n\n\nMultiball\n\n\nThe standard multiball is started after locking three balls. Once that\nis done, the three balls are ejected from the volcano and fed to the right\nflipper. The left and right ramps are lit for jackpots. Jackpots stay lit\nfor the whole multiball and score as described below. The Super Jackpot\nmust be lit by shooting a ball into the AMY saucer. The ball will then\nbe fed back to the upper flipper with the Super Jackpot lit for approximately\n20 seconds. Score the Super Jackpot for 2 x Jackpot back at the saucer,\nbut only through the \"Super Score\" upper-upper orbit. Scoring the Super\nJackpot resets the timer.\nJackpots are based on the number of diamonds collected at start of multiball.\nThe formula for calculating that figure is not quite clear. Certain\nthings are known: The value is always in increments of 500K.\nAt 12 AND 13 diamonds collected the value is 16.5M. It seems to increase\nby 500K for every diamond collected after 16.5M up to a point, then the\nformula/value changes. A few examples of the jackpot values are as\nfollows: 14 diamonds = 17M, 38 diamonds = 22.5M, 45 diamonds = 26M, 52\ndiamonds = 28M. If multiball is started by defeating the lower gray\ngorilla in the 2nd round of GRAY attack, the jackpot is significantly less,\nabout half of what it is when started by locking 3 balls.\n\n\nM-A-P Awards\n\n\nShoot the left ramp to collect M-A-P letters. Once three letters are collected,\nthe shots to the ramp are diverted to the left flipper for a shot at the\nMAP award saucer. If you collect all 3 letters in subsequent shots, you\ncollect the MAP Combo for 20M. If MAP is lit at the saucer, you may collect\nadditional letters but if you complete they will be lost.\nThere are 3 consecutive routes (on the dot matrix display) that\nthe map travel can take to earn the ordered awards. Each route starts\nwith an award of 25M and ends in either Diamond Hunt Multiball award or\nthe \"?\" by the volcano on the map to award 50 diamonds. Note: there\nare several \"?\" awards on the map, but only the one at the end (next to\nthe volcano) of one of the routes awards 50 diamonds. Once a route\nis completed, the map starts over with the next route, until all three\nare completed, then they start over with route 1. The 3 routes with\ntheir ordered awards are listed below. Don't expect to get much into\nthe second route because even in some of the highest scored games rarely\ndoes one get much past the first completed route.\n\n\n\nROUTE 1\nROUTE 2\nROUTE 3\n\n25M\n25M\n25M\n\nRe-light Diamonds\n\"?\" 5 Diamonds\n\"?\" 5 Diamonds\n\nJungle Jackpot\nJungle Jackpot\nJungle Jackpot\n\nLight Extra Ball\n\"?\" Re-light Diamonds\n\"?\" Re-light Diamonds\n\nRe-light Diamonds\nRe-light Diamonds\nRe-light Diamonds\n\nSkill Fire\nMultiball*\nSkill Fire\n\nRe-light Diamonds\nRe-light Diamonds\nRe-light Diamonds\n\n25M\n25M\n25M\n\nDiamond Hunt Multiball\n\"?\" 50 Diamonds\nDiamond Hunt Multiball\n\n\n* - There is a bug in the software (version 2.1) that\nawards Jungle Jackpot mode instead of Multiball that is indicated on the\nmap. Too bad because multiball would have added more variety since\nJungle jackpot would have already been awarded two times before you got\nto this award.\n\n\nDiamond Hunt Multiball\n\n\nThis mode is started as an award at Mystery or MAP. You get 1 diamond for\nstarting and all diamond shots are lit for 2 diamonds each. This is a 2\nball multiball with play continuing until 1 ball is left. A good way to\ncollect diamonds towards your 100 diamond goal.\n\n\nJungle Jackpot -> Ghost Tribe Multiball\n\n\nThis mode is started from a MAP award. The ball is released and a countdown\nfrom 20M is started. Collect the Jungle Jackpot by re- shooting the MAP\nsaucer. Once the countdown reaches 5M it stays until timed out. If you\ncollect the Jungle Jackpot, you start Ghost Tribe multiball. This is a\n2 ball multiball where either MAP or Mystery saucer scores the Jungle Jackpot.\nScoring both saucers at the same time awards a super jackpot of 40M.\n\n\nSkill Fire\n\n\nThis is a very unique mode and the most valuable mode of the game (other\nthan the \"wizard\" mode). Skill Fire is lit at the MAP saucer by a MAP award.\nOnce the MAP saucer is shot, Skill Fire begins. Normal game play ends,\nflippers die, and the ball is ejected and drained. You have 20 seconds\nto shoot as many skill shots as you can. Shoot for the super skill shot\nobviously. The base value for the regular skill shot is 10M and for the\nsuper skill shot it is 20M. Each time you score a skill shot, the\nvalue of both shots increases by the base value of the shot you just made.\nSuper Skill value caps out at 100M, regular skill at 50M. [The following\nhas not been observed on another machine, it is very likely that this was\noccurring in an early ROM revision. It is severely game unbalancing\nso this is very likely] If you miss at this point it goes down\nto 50M. (Need more input about specifically what happens on a miss:\ndivide by 2??) With a perfect run you can score 1B+ on this mode alone!!\nNote that the software does not expect this and has trouble displaying\na 1 Billion score at the completion of this mode. I usually score 1B on\na perfect but I have scored 1B missing one shot so I think it is possible\nto score one more. After the mode times out, the machine waits until all\nthe balls settle in the trough before restarting your ball and allowing\nyou to start the ball off with yet one more skill shot! Our machine has\na problem in that sometimes the game refuses to serve another ball and\neffectively ends your mode prematurely.\n\n\nA-M-Y Mode\n\n\nCompleting the rollovers lights the saucer for AMY mode which the ball\nwill drop into next. A countdown is started at 25M and the ball is delivered\nto the holder in the left orbit to be fed to your left flipper for a shot\nat the upper upper orbit back to the saucer. If you collect via the upper\nupper orbit you get Super Score (double). If you collect the award, Amy\nwill say something nice to you and start another countdown. If you collect\n3 awards you get 15 diamonds for completing it. If the countdown times\nout, the mode is over. See Software Bugs section.\n\n\nGRAY Attack\n\n\nOnce you complete G-R-A-Y at the GRAY lane, the ball is held at the holder\nin the left orbit and the lower playfield is activated. You use the flippers\nto have the gorilla bat the ball with his hands at 5 C-O-N-G-O targets.\nScore 10M a target and complete the targets for an award before the timer\nruns out (15 seconds). Awards in order:\n\n\n20 Diamonds\n\nMultiball\n\n20 Diamonds\n\nLight EB Left\n\n50M from then on...\n\nOnce you get to the 4th level, a letter scored stays lit for only about\n5 seconds so you have to act fast! Note that the mechanics are a little\nstrange. There are 3 positions to the gorilla: hands parallel, left hand\nback/right hand forward, right hand forward/left hand back. So in order\nto move the right hand back, you need to hit the left flipper to move the\nleft hand forward. This gives you a better angle shot at the corner targets.\nDon't just bat wildly, think a little about what you are doing and you\nshould score it every time. If you don't, you are a loser ;)\nSome people feel that the Gray attack is too easy to defeat, however\nthe skill comes into play by liting it in the first place. Furthermore,\nthere is an operator setting that can be set so that the GRAY letters do\nnot carry over from ball to ball, just in case the Gray attack and the\nresulting awards are awarded too frequently.\n\n\nMystery Awards\n\n\n\n\n25 Million\n\nLight Extra Ball (Left)\n\nLight Lock\n\nDiamond Hunt Multiball\n\nMultiball\n\nGRAY Complete\n\nGRAY Attack\n\n15 Diamonds\n\nIncrease Bonus Multiplier\n\n\n\nVideo Mode\n\n\n\"Watch out for the HIPPOS!!!\"\nYou steer a boat, avoid rocks (1st wave), Hippos (2nd wave), etc...\nas follows:\n\n\n1st Wave: Rocks\n\n2nd Wave: Hippos\n\n3rd Wave: Rocks (collect diamonds)\n\n4th+ Wave: Rocks and Hippos (collect diamonds)\n\nWatch out for this video mode, the boat moves in a sluggish manner when\nyou initially move it but speeds up as you hold the flipper button so you\nneed to develop a sweeping type of motion, because you are a boat in water!\nVideo mode scores 1M to start and 5M for each object avoided. Video mode\nis lit by completing \"We are watching you\" via hieroglyphic hits (see above).\n\n\nMine Shaft\n\n\nThis is always lit at the upper upper orbit unless in a timed mode or multiball.\nScoring it puts you in a video mode where you simply choose an entrance\nand get an award. No skill here whatsoever. You go through different stages.\nThe first has 2 choices, 2nd has 3, 3rd has 4, 4th has 5, and 5th has 5.\nChoosing an entrance will give you either 5 diamonds, a snake biting your\nhead off, a bear mauling you, or N * 10M for completing stage N. If you\nget the point award you move to the next stage and continue. If you mess\nup, you continue at the same place the next time with previous choices\nboarded up. If you complete the 5th stage and you score the points award,\nyou get 15 diamonds and next time you start over with a new pattern.\nI BELIEVE there are a small number of fixed patterns. I mapped one once\nand I see that same one repeated, so the actual maps of the mine will be\nlisted here as they become available if you want to memorize them(!). [Actually,\nmemorizing them would give a serious competitive advantage!]\n\n\nSatellite Transfer\n\n\nYou hit each satellite target to light a panel on the satellite. You need\nto complete both targets 4 times to start Satellite Transfer mode. Each\nhit to the targets scores 10M. There are different images on the screen\nfor each hit. This is a timed mode lasting 25 seconds. From RGP: The first\nsix or seven hits will get you various pictures of gorillas, diamonds and\nthe like. The eighth hit gives a cow that mooohhs at you. The next hit\ngives a duck that quacks, I believe it to be the peking duck from Shadow.\nAfter that comes the picture \"move your car\" from CFBL, with the appropriate\nsampling. Then follows the \"Here's Your Hotdog\" picture without the original\nsampling, a picture I do not remember, and after that it wraps around and\ngoes from the beginning.\n\n\nBonus\n\nAt the end of the ball, bonus is 500K per diamond collected, that's it!\nBut with a good multiplier and lots of diamonds collected it can add up!\nThis bonus is then multiplied by the current bonus multiplier which\nis held or not held per operator setting. Default is not held.\n\n\nExtra Balls\n\n\nThere are many ways to collect extra balls in this game:\n\n\nMAP award lights left orbit\n\n3 Volcano Ramps (based on operator setting) lights Volcano Ramp (right)\n\nMystery lights left orbit\n\nGRAY Gorilla Defeated 4th time lights left\n\nComplete Bonus 5x lights (left)\n\nWhen a second extra ball is lit it moves to the open extra ball side rather\nthan stacking. If they are both full, I believe they stack.\n\n\nTournament Mode\n\n\nLike most Bally/Williams games, Congo can be switched into \"Tournament\nMode\" by the operator. Like the last few Bally/Williams games, the player\ncan also do this; just insert the money, then hold down both flippers,\nwait for \"TOURNAMENT MODE ENABLED--PRESS START\" to pop up on the display,\nthen press Start.\nOnly thing we have noticed so far is that random awards are given in\na fixed pattern every time. That pattern will be printed here when available.\nExtra balls are still awarded!\n\n\nStrategy\n\nThis game has a remarkable linear scoring pattern to it. That is, there\nare no BIG POINTS areas (except for Skill Fire on an early ROM revision\nand maybe the Wizard Mode), so you have to just keep plugging along and\nslowly edge your score up. This makes competition more fun I think because\none person can't just break through. The skill fire does unbalance the\ngame in early ROM revisions because the super skill shot is too easy.\nSo the idea is -\n\n\nGet the extra balls! They are easy to get, so get them!\n\nGet MAP awards while locking balls along the way.\n\nPlay multiballs as they come.\n\nKeep your kickback lit!\n\nCollect mystery award after spelling ZINJ.\n\nSpell GRAY and defeat lower gorilla for big awards.\n\nThat's all there is! Seriously, if you just do that, you do as good as\nyou can (that's why most wizards don't like this game). One trick I use\nis to collect 3 MAP letters to set the diverter to the left flipper, then\nshoot the volcano ramp repeatedly to get the extra ball while the ball\nis always delivered to your left flipper for repeated shots. Collect the\nextra ball, then move back on the MAP bandwagon... it's easy safe shots.\n\n\nSoftware Bugs\n\n\nWith the latest known revision (as of 6/99) 2.1 there are a few pretty\nsignificant bugs. One bug is described as follows: When the extra\nball is lit and scored while in Amy Mode and the ball tries to score Amy\nby going in the saucer (as it should), the extra ball is awarded but Amy\nis NOT. Instead, the ball just sits in the saucer while the Amy Hurry-Up\ncounts down until a ball search finally kicks it out! By this time\nyou have lost the Amy score and any chance of completing Amy Mode for a\n15 diamond award. Another bug is that one of the MAP awards (in the\nsecond route) on the dot matrix display is Multiball yet the MAP saucer\nawards Jungle Jackpot instead. Also, occasionally the ball save will\ncontinuously stay lit for approximately half a minute while the ball is\nin play even though the setting may be at 5 seconds.\n\nEaster Eggs [SPOILER!!]\n\nSee Satellite Transfer section for Cows, Ducks, Move Your Car, Here's Your\nHotdog. Also, the dot matrix display will show the words Big Points\nas a joke during the bonus count when the bonus is extremely low, if you\ncollect no diamonds. You will also get a voice saying \"Big Points\"\nor other compliment when your bonus count actually is really good, 100M\nor more.\nSpecial Secret Mode: Yes, there IS a midnight madness! As long\nas the \"Special Mode\" setting is on. Most recent Williams/Bally games\nhave a midnight madness feature.\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n\n\nHTML added by\nDavid Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n\nE-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web\nlinks have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Congo", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/congo.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Congo", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Kopera\nOrigonal sounds/Music: Paul Heitsch\nSoftware effects: Bill Grupp\nArt graphics: Dan Hughes\nDot Matrix art: Eugene Geer and Scott Matrix\nAll Guitars: Vince Pontarelli\nRule sheet: Cameron Silver ;-)\n\n\nComments\n\nIt's a weird one! The lockdown bar and exposed metal is all black and feels\nvery much like a Data East machine. I hope Corvette is the only game like\nthis. It's not that I'm having a go at DE, it's just that I like the fact\nthat the two companies produce machines that are different in as many ways\npossible.\n\nThe sound is disappointing. The main play music is far too repetitive. Just\none short guitar riff over-and-over again. There are however, lots of beefy\nroaring engine noises that I quite like. The game over music is terrific!\n\nThe display is great. Lots of really nice animation. For example, the\nBonus X, Replay, Extra Ball, Quadra Jets and Car Awarded from Route 66.\n\nThe test features are great for the Engine and Race .. well done here.\nThis game also features lamp Row and Column tests .. well done once again\n[I hope this test will become a new standard].\n\nThe outlanes didn't give me a lot of problems, but the centre drain seemed\nto be a real trendy destination for balls..\n\nThe game takes getting used to. Stick with it as it's a very good game\nonce you get familiar with it. It has some fresh new ideas, and the gimmicks\nare cool.\n\nCongrats go to the designer of the Engine (I assume that is Tomas M.\nKopera). This could have been a complicated nightmare, but it's so\nsimple even a Lyle could fix it!\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nThe game has a MANUAL PLUNGER!!! Yey!\n\nI'll start from the bottom left, and go around in a clockwise direction.\n\n\n Left Flipper  Standard length.\n\n Left Inlane  Can be lit for extra ball.\n\n Left Outlane  Has a kickback. Balls kicked out from here are fed neatly to\nthe upper flipper.\n\n Three Bank  Three red standup targets. Completing them lights Turbo Boost at\nthe spinner.\n\n Upper Flipper  Very standard type of flipper. Push the button and away it\ngoes! Used to shoot the side loop, and side ramp.\n\n Left Orbit  Starts at the upper flipper. The orbit goes around the back of\nthe machine and out the right orbit. Again, very standard. The kickback\nfeeds balls to this point, as does the lock, engine, side loop and right\norbit. There is a very sneaky one-way gate at the entrance of this orbit\n(similar to the one leading out of the bumpers on Bride Of Pinbot) so\nit is a really wide shot to hit, but balls always get fed nicely to the\nflipper. Shot this orbit to light lock. There is a high score position\n(World Speed Record) for the person who shoots the most consecutive Left\nOrbits. An orbit IS credited if the ball dribbles into the LT1 roll-\nover lanes. This can also be lit for Qualify (See the section in the rule\nsheet).\n\n Million Target  At the left of the left ramp entrance is a small stand-up\nthat awards millions when it's hit.\n\n Left Ramp  Also the Engine. This feeds the engine (which I'll get to shortly).\nThis is the start multiball and lock shots as well as a few other things.\n\n Engine  One of the big toys in the game. It is a large plastic engine that\nshakes from side to side. The inside is lined with rubber, so the ball\nbounces around a lot. The ball normally enters the engine at the front\n(from the ramp) and passes right through, out the back and drops into the\norbit. The front of the engine has a one way gate so the ball won't come\nflying back down the ramp. The back of the engine has a controlled gate.\nNormally the gate is up and the ball passes right through, however when\nthe gate is closed, the ball stays in the engine which starts to shake.\nEventually the ball shakes its way to the front, there it falls down, and\ninto the lock. (The lock is the same as the one on Twilight Zone: A saucer\nwith room for two balls behind it.)\n\n Pit In  A sinkhole that starts the Race (more later), spots a Blue Light (More\nLater) or collects a hurry up. Balls put here are popped (with incredible\nforce) to a wire-form ramp which leads to the left inlane.\n\n Spinner  This is situated over a small lane leading to the bumpers. The\nspinner can be lit for Turbo Boost which is like Super/Ultra Spinner. I\ncould not work out how much per spin it was though. Turbo Boost is lit by\ncompleting the Three Bank of targets.\n\n Bumpers  Usual three in the all too familiar triangle shape. Can be lit for\nQuadra Jets which is a million per bump much like Star Trek.\n\n LT1  Three rollover lanes above the bumpers that increase the bonus multiplier\nwhen completed. Bonus X is 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x with lite EB. Then 10, 15, 20 etc\nmillion after.\n\n Side Loop  A small orbit much like the trapdoor shot on Funhouse. This is\nthe Horse Power Jackpot during multiball. Weak shots end up at the LT1\nroll overs, while the rest go to the upper flipper. There is a high score\nposition (Cornering Champ) for the person who shoots the most consecutive\nSide Loops. A side loop IS credited if the ball dribbles into the LT1\nroll-over lanes. This can also serve as a Super Skill Shot shot.\n\n Side Ramp  A ramp much like the skill shot one on Demolition Man. This ramp\ncurves around and feeds the ball back to the right inlane. This is the\nTorque Jackpot during multiball. It can also serve as a Super Skill shot.\n\n Raucous target  Shooting the right orbit->raucous target combo, will award\na letter in RAUCOUS. Each letter is worth 5 Million.\n\n Right Ramp  Called the Route 66 ramp. It awards Route 66 awards every second\nshot. It normally sends balls to the left inlane, but when a Route 66 is\nawarded, the ball is diverted to a kicker down the back of the playfield.\n\n Right Orbit  Fairly standard type of orbit. Weak shots feed into the LT1\nrollovers, while the rest go to the upper flipper. There is a high score\nposition (World Speed Champ) for the person who shoots the most consecutive\nRight Orbits. An orbit shot IS credited if the ball dribbles into the LT1\nroll-over lanes.\n\n Kick Back Target  A single large red standup that is used to re-light the\nkickback. It's a piss easy shot and can be used as soon as the kickback\ngoes off. Note that it doesn't actually light until the kickback times\nout, but it can still be used immediately. On early ROMs (PA-1), the kick\nback target seems to always flash.\n\n Race Track  This extends from just above the plunger, right down the right\nside to the back of the playfield. Two cars (one red, one blue) race each\nother in the course of the game. This seems to be really well implemented,\nthe machine knows where both cars are at all times, and the race is played\non the display too for when the hardware fails.\n\n Right Flipper  Standard length.\n\n Right Inlane  Can be lit for extra ball.\n\n Right Outlane  Usual type. Can be lit for extra ball.\n\n\nRules\n\nSkill Shot\n\nLike the Flintstones. The plunged ball bounces around the LT1 rollovers,\nand you must steer the flashing light to the lane that the ball will go\nthrough. First time is 5 Mil, then 10 Mil then 15 etc.. There does not appear\nto be an upper limit on the skill shot value. The skill shot is available for\nall plunged balls except ball saver ones.  There is also a Super Skill Shot,\nexplained below. See the Bugs/Easter Eggs section for the skill shot bugs.\n\nSuper Skill Shot\n\nIf you hit LLRLL before plunging, the control gate near the LT1 roll-over\nlanes will open, allowing the plunged ball to go to the upper flipper for\na shot at the side ramp, or loop. Hit RRLRR to close the gate again. The\ninitial values for the loop and ramp are 10 and 15 million, which increases\nby 5 million for each successful shot. The super skill shot is available for\nall plunged balls except ball saver ones. See the Bugs/Easter Eggs section\nfor the skill shot bugs.\n\nModes\n\nNot modes as such, more like awards. Shoot the right ramp once and it will\ntell you what the next award will be. Shoot it again and the ball will be\ndiverted to a kicker at the back of the playfield. The mode will start,\nand the ball will be kicked to the left inlane. The diverter on our machine\nwas broken (that stupid spring-link). So I fixed it, but the new one broke\ntoo! This would normally be OK, but there was NO COMPENSATION for it! The\nball would not be diverted, and it wouldn't start the mode. The modes are:\n\n\n  Catch Me   A lady pulls up in a car and says \"Catch\nme if you can!\" You have 20 seconds to make each shot (the really cool\nthing is that as the time counts down, each second speeds by on a road\nsign!) The shots are Right orbit, then side ramp, then left ramp, then Pit\nIn. I have no idea how the scoring works, but the total for making all\nshots is 230 Million. One shot is worth 32 Million, and three shots is\nworth 144 Million. I don't know about two! The quotes are along the lines\nof \"Your some kind of driver\".\nSometimes this mode is run in French! (With translations). If you\ncomplete this, you'll start a 2 ball multiball with every target worth\n500k.\n\n  Car Awarded  Awards a car (more later). The animation is amazing!\n\n  Pit In  A hurry up. Counts down from 60 Million (to 25). The quotes are cool,\n\"He's sliding around a wee bit. He'll have to change a tire\". Shoot Pit In\nto collect value. Once collected a two ball multiball starts and the Pit\nre-awards the same value until 1 or more balls drain.\n\n  Quadra Jets  One million a pop much like Star Trek. (And a law-suit from\nApple).\n\n  Bonus X  Awards a bonus X.\n\n  Points  25 million.\n\n  Special  Awards a special.\n\n  Extra Ball  Lights extra ball at the in/out lanes.\n\n\n  Race Today  This is lit with an inlay at the base of the ramp, every 8, 24,\n40 etc, Spark Plugs. It's a brilliant video mode that's really a drag\nrace. The left flipper controls the accelerator, and the right shifts up\na gear. The display shows revs and the two slot cars race. It's very easy\nto win, and it's all over pretty quick, but it's great fun. If you win, you\nstart a 2 ball multiball with every ramp worth 15 million. After completing\nthe Future Car, it is really hard to win the Drag Race. So be warned!\n\n\nMultiball\n\nLeft orbit lights lock in the engine. For the first multiball it'll light\nall three locks, for other multiballs it will only light one lock (and in\neven LATER multiballs, the lock times out.). Shoot the engine to lock balls.\n\nEach locked ball will award a car for the first multiball only. This is\nnot true of prototype ROMs.\n\nWhen the third ball is shot into the engine, you start Rev Mode. This was\nstupid. Hit the flippers to keep the revs up, and keep the engine shaking.\nThe longer it takes for the ball to fall in the lock, the more points you\nget; the most is 50 million. As soon as the ball falls into lock, multiball\nbegins. All three balls will be kicked out to the upper flipper.\n\nBoth of these methods have been discovered!\n\nIncrease the jackpot by shooting the Side Ramp->Unlit Engine. This adds\n20 Million, and usually happens during one of the 2-ball multiballs when the\nengine is not lit for anything.\n\nOR:\n\nIncrease the jackpots by shooting the engine when lock is not lit. Every\nthird or fourth shot will increase the jackpot.\n\nThe initial value of the Horse Power (Side Loop) is 50 Million, plus what\nit was raised before hand. The Torque (side ramp) jackpot seems to start\nat 30 million.\n\nThere is also a Super Jackpot for the Side Loop->Side Ramp combo. This\ncan be shot while one or both of the regular jackpots are lit. This is worth\ndouble the Torque (Side Ramp) jackpot.\n\nThe Horse Power jackpot seems to max at 100 Million, which means you can\nget 80 Million for Torque, and 200 Million for Super.\n\nAs soon as you have the 2 regular jackpots, they both relite for 20 Million\nmore.\n\nJackpot animation is really nice.\n\nIf two balls drain and no jackpots have been scored, you have 10 seconds\nto shoot the engine to restart it. Restarted multiballs are two ball only.\nYou can get a jackpot in the grace period, and still restart multiball. Is\nthis a bug?\n\nCollecting Cars\n\nCars is the object of this game. There are 9 cars to collect, then the\nwizard bonus. The cars are displayed in the centre of the playfield in a\nsmall honeycomb layout. Lit cars have been awarded, blank cars haven't, and\nthe flashing one will be awarded next. (Note: No cars will flash unless the\nPit is lit to challenge). Cars can be collected by:\n\n Route 66 award\n The Challenge\n Locking balls (first multiball only)\n Completing (winning) the Drag Race.\n\n\nThe cars are:\n\n 1953 Blue Flame Six\n 1963 Grand Sport\n 1963 \"Fuelie\" split window Coupe\n 1967 Stingray L-88\n 1971 LT-1 Stingray\n 1978 Indy Pace Car L-82\n 1982 Collector Edition L-83\n 1989 Corvette Challenge L-98\n 1993 ZR-1 40th Anniversary LT-5\n\n\nWhen all cars are completed, you start a puzzle mode. This was quite\ngood. All shots are lit, and each one adds a piece to the Jigsaw Puzzle on\nthe screen. There are 9 pieces. When the puzzle is complete, it shows a 1997\nCorvette! Four ball multiball will start with the left ramp (Engine Jackpot)\nbeing worth 25M * balls-in-play, for a range of 50-100M.\n\nThe cars reset after puzzle mode. (On older ROMs, they remain lit, and you\ncan no longer get any. However, the drag race keeps getting harder.)\n\nChallenge\n\nThis is lit at the pit by shooting all of the flashing Speed Parts. They are\nthe blue inlays that flash when need to be hit.\n\n Big Block - left orbit\n Hi Lift Cams - left ramp\n Six Speed Trans - left ramp\n Fuelie - side loop\n Nitrous - side loop\n Sticky Tires - side ramp\n Big breaks - right orbit\n Z07 Suspension - right orbit\n Supercharger - right orbit\n\n\nThe pit (when not lit for Challenge) will spot a Blue light, and light\nChallenge if necessary.\n\nThe actual challenge is really cool. The machine is the red car, and the\nplayer has the blue car. The red car will start moving forward slowly (the\nmore times you race, the faster the red car gets..), as does the blue car.\nTo advance the blue car, shot anything [the flashing arrow shots will advance\nthe most]. The whole thing is played out on the display too, which is good\nfor when (err .. I mean if!) the hardware breaks. If you win you get heaps of\npoints (not sure how it's worked out) and a great animation. If you loose\nyou only get a few points, and the condescending message \"Better luck next\ntime\".\n\nIf you shoot the Pit during the Challenge, the display shows a pit crew\nworking on your car, complete with appropriate sounds. If you keep hitting\nthe flipper buttons, your car will catch up to the red car. If you're in\nfront of the red car, nothing will happen.\n\nIt also seems that whenever you flip, the blue car will be advanced a bit,\nthis means that if you flip like a madman, you only need a few shots to win.\nAfter the first few Challenges, you need to hit so many shots that flipping\na win is almost impossible anyway.\n\nTurbo Boost\n\nLight this by completing the Three bank on the left of the playfield. The\nspinner will be lit for 500k per spin. The sound is very much like Super\nSpinner in Star Trek. There is a Turbo Boost part of the end of ball Bonus,\nbut it is NOT the total of this mode. It must have something to do with the\ntargets.\n\nQualify\n\nGoing through the right inlane lights the left orbit for Qualify.  It is\nworth 15 million initially, then 5 million more each time. An upper limit\nis not known at this point.\n\nBonus Multipliers\n\nComplete the LT1 lanes above the bumpers to increase the Bonus X. It goes\nfrom 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x and light extra ball. After 8x, completing LT1 awards\n10 Million, then 15 Million, then 20 Million and so on.\n\nSpark Plug awards\n\nAll shots (except the Pit) have an arrow. Shooting lit shots count up\nSpark Plugs. Every 8 Spark Plugs alternates between: Points, and Light\nRace Today. There is an extra ball in there that reflexes around 9ish.\n\nThe spark plugs in the animation, are actually AC/Delco plugs. I'm sure\nthis info is usefull for somebody.\n\nTrack Combos\n\nThere are plenty of Track Combos in the game, awarded for making certain\nshots. Each ball has a new total for all combos, ie: when a combo is awarded,\nyou get (all combo values)+(value of this combo). See the values below:\n\nTwo shot Tracks:\n\n Grand Prix:    Right Orbit -> Side Ramp   (+12M)\n Sebring:       Right Orbit -> Side Loop   (+12M)\n Hurburgring:   Right Orbit -> Right Ramp  (+12?)\n Mid-Ohio:      Engine -> Side Ramp        (+6M)\n Lime Rock:     Engine -> Side Loop        (+6M)\n Robeling Road: Side Loop -> Side Ramp     (+10M)\n Road Atlanta:  Left Orbit -> Engine       (+8?)\n\n\nThree shot Tracks:\n\n Elkton Lane:     Engine -> Side Loop -> Side Ramp (+24M)\n Willow Springs:  Right Orbit -> Side Loop -> Side Ramp (+20M?)\n\n\nBonus Count\n\nEnd of ball bonus is added up fast ... very fast. It is made up of:\n\n Big points. (Seems to be 500k * Ball Number)\n 10 Million * number of cars collected. Maxes at 90 Million\n 8 Million if you complete RAUCOUS\n 4 Million per Track Combo (resets each ball)\n Turbo Boost total (if necessary)\n\n\nThis all adds up to:\n(4M/track + Raucous + Turbo Boost + Big Points) * BonusX + 10M*cars.\n\nHigh Scores\n\nAs well as the usual Grand Champ and four best scores, we also have:\n\n Future Car Champ: Highest Future Car score.\n World Speed Record: Most consecutive orbit shots.\n Cornering Champ: Most consecutive Small Loop shots.\n\n\nCredits are awarded for all of these, but only a max of 2 credits for High\nscores will be awarded. So if you get GC, you will not get any more credits.\nI like this arrangement.\n\nBugs/Easter Eggs\n\nSo far we we know of the following:\n\n There is a Super Skill Shot. See that section under Rules for more info.\n Hitting a flipper button before plunging causes the motor to shake (along\nwith a cool revving sound, although not as cool as Getaway.)\n Cow: One of the tracks is the Holisten Track - which is a cows head.\n In some places, Special Edition is spelt Special Adition. This occurs\non the display only, and not on the playfield.\n The ball can get stuck under the Route 66 ramp when you miss a shot to the\nside ramp by a little bit, or almost make it up and it comes flying back\ndown and wedges it self pretty well.  Usually flipping a lot will take\ncare of the problem, but not always.\n The lock can time out on later rounds DURING rev-mode!  That means you can\nsit there and rev away, lock times out, it merrily kicks the ball back at\nyou without starting multiball.\n Skill Shot Bug 1: It seems that if the ball doesn't go into the roll\nover lanes, the ball saver doesn't come on. Grrrr\n I have seen skill shot lit->ball save->skill shot not lit->ball save->\nskill shot lit.\n Big Breaks activates the one-way gate so that it sort of simulates the\ncar screeching to a halt right in front of the cliff...  The animation\nis pretty nifty, but that closed gate kind of annoying, probably because\nit's unexpected.\n\n\nMatch Animation\n\nThe match animation is fantastic. It is far too good to describe here!\n\nHow the Engine Works\n\nI had a quick look at the manual today. Here is a very rough ascii drawing\nof how the solenoids fit in.... [It is NOT a drawing of the engine, just a\nguide as to how the solenoids tilt it.]\n\nNote:\n\n X is the pivot point\n Solenoid B is right behind solenoid A.\n Solenoid D is right behind solenoid C.\n All four coils are standard 1200 coils.\n\n\n\n     --------------------X--------------------\n      |                                     |\n      | Shaft                               | Shaft\n      |                                     |\n   -------                               -------\n   |     |                               |     |\n   |     |                               |     |\n   |     | Solenoid A                    |     | Solenoid C\n   |     |                               |     |\n----------                               ----------\n\n\nSolenoids A and B are controlled by two separate transistors, but the two\ntransistors seem to receive the same signals. The same applies for\nsolenoids C and D. To tilt the Engine left, solenoids A and B are energized\nfully, and to tilt the engine right, solenoids C and D are energized fully.\nThe 128 different positions are achieved 'dimming' the solenoids, so that\n(for example) solenoids A amd B will have 1/4 or the voltage, and at the\nsame time, solenoids C and D have 3/4 of the voltage. This would result in\na half tilt right.\n\nThe board that controls all of this is connected via a ribbon cable to some\njunk in the backbox. There are no (that I could tell) regular solenoid driver\ntransistor connected to this board.\n\nThe machine can only \"tell\" the Engine where in the 128 range to go, but if\nthe engine jams, the machine won't know. There are optos to indicate when the\nengine is fully left, or right. The whole thing is calibrated after a slam\ntilt, or powercycle. It takes about 10 seconds, and really shows the power\nand flexibility of the system.\n\nNow remember, all this was derived by a 20 second peek at the manual (I was\nhungry!), so please forgive the errors.\n\nYou may be thinking \"Wow, why such a complex design to tilt a plastic engine\".\nWell it's actually really simple. No Motor or Gears which is the biggest cause\nof problems with things like the Path Of Adventure (Indiana Jones) and the\nGuns in Star Trek. Also, most techs are familiar with solenoids (and the\nones used here are very common) so they should have no difficulty when it\ncomes to fixing it.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Corvette", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/corvette.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Corvette", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Please be forgiving of my numbers.\n\nObject of the Game\n\nStart the Movie, Search for and Rescue the Girl, get Jackpots and Super\nJackpots, lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nImportant Things\nThis is a glossary of the shots and features that will be referred to during\nthe discussion of the game.  It's possible to play this game for quite a\nwhile and never actually find a few of these shots, because the playfield\nis rather cluttered.\n\n\n Flippers  These are the usual two flippers in the usual locations.  They are\nnormal long flippers - the game would truly be unplayable with short\nlightning flippers.\n Plunger - This is a normal plunger.\n P-A-I-D Lanes  These are four rollover lanes in the upper right area of the\nplayfield.  The lights in the lanes can be steered with the flippers.  The\nlights are steerable in both directions.\n Back Orbit  This is a passage which leads down the Left Saucer Lane from the\nupper left corner of the P-A-I-D Lanes area.\n Jet Bumpers  These are three jet bumpers in a contained area beneath the\nP-A-I-D Lanes.  The only exit is down the Right Saucer Lane.\n Right Saucer Lane  This lane is at the far right side of the playfield,\nstarting above the right Slingshot.\n Right Saucer  This saucer is at the top of the Right Saucer Lane.  It kicks\nballs up and over the playfield to come down the Left Saucer Lane.\n Right Ramp  This is a large, shallow ramp to the left of the Right Saucer\nLane, which returns to the Left Inlane.  This ramp has a marquee above it,\nlisting Big Millions, Movie Madness, and Count Up to Feature.\n Snackbar  This is a sinkhole in the center of the playfield.  Balls sunk\nhere are ejected into the Right Inlane.  There is a marquee above it,\nlisting Super Jackpot, Jackpot, Rescue, and Multiball Restart.  There is a\nred light to the right of the Snackbar, which is flashing when it is open,\nand lit when it has been opened and collected.\n Menu Targets  These are four blue-green plastic targets in the middle of the\nplayfield.  Two are to the right of the Snackbar, facing left, and the\nother two are to the left of the Left Ramp, facing right.\n Center Shot  This is a double-gated S-shaped lane in the middle of the\nplayfield, which leads to the P-A-I-D Lanes.  It is labeled Collect Bonus,\nParking OK, \"Hey, Move Your Car!\" and Extra Ball.\n Left Ramp  This is a steep ramp in the upper left corner of the playfield.\nIt has a short entrance and a diverter, which normally feeds the ball\ndirectly to the Right Inlane.  This ramp has a marquee above it, listing\nUnlimited Millions, Creature Feature, and Xtra Ball Countdown.\n Creature Ramp  This is also the Left Ramp, with the diverter activated.\nThis feeds the ball through a long, slow, swooping ramp before reaching the\nWhirlpool above the Right Inlane.  This should only happen when some sort\nof Creature Feature is lit.\n K-I-S-S Lights  These four lights, below the entrance to the Left Saucer\nLane, indicate progress in spelling K-I-S-S.  Normally, they are white.  In\npre-release machines, they are red.\n Left Saucer Lane  This lane is at the far left side of the playfield,\nstarting above the left Slingshot.  There is a short, sharp turn at its\nend, leading into the Left Saucer.\n Left Saucer  This saucer is at the end of the Left Saucer Lane.  It is\nturned in slightly from the normal curve of the Lane.  It feeds balls to\nthe Right Inlane.  It is not actually a saucer, but a sinkhole.\n Creature  This is the round plastic area in the middle of the playfield,\nbeneath which the Creature hologram is hidden.\n F-I-L-M  These four lights, slightly above and between the flippers,\nindicate progress towards spelling F-I-L-M.\n Inlanes  These lanes do nothing remarkable (except catch balls against the\npost, due to the Mylar cutouts in this area).  Note that there is not any\nrubber on the pins separating Inlanes from Outlanes (unless your operator\nwent to a lot of trouble to be nice to you).  The Left Inlane is labeled\n10M, 20M, and 30M - see \"Super Scoring\".\n Outlanes  These lanes award FOCUS, which is always 500K.  Note that you can\ncollect FOCUS more than once per ball ;)  Specials can also be lit on the\nOutlanes, as EXIT lights.\n Slingshots  These are the usual two above the flippers.\n Rudy  This is a large plastic... oh, never mind.\n\n\nSkill Shot(s)\nThere are effectively two Skill Shots in Creature - three if you're picky.\nThe obvious Skill Shot is that one of the P-A-I-D lanes is flashing.  Hitting\nthat flashing lane will immediately complete P-A-I-D, advancing the bonus\nmultiplier and spotting the L letter in F-I-L-M.  Note that hitting the\nflashing lane does not reset the lit lanes, yet if the other three lanes are\nlit, hitting the \"unlit\" flashing lane will effectively complete P-A-I-D\ntwice (increasing the multiplier twice) and leave only one lane unlit, making\nit easy to complete P-A-I-D a third time for only rolling through two lanes.\n\nThe other Skill Shot is scored by firing the ball all the way around the Back\nOrbit and down the Left Saucer Lane.  Whenever the F letter in F-I-L-M is not\nlit, and you did not collect any Jackpots in the most recent Multiball, the\nK-I-S-S letters will be lit in a cycling pattern.  However many letters are\nlit when the ball passes the sensor in the back left corner of the Back Orbit\nwill be spotted immediately.  It is sometimes possible to get zero letters\nfrom this Skill Shot.\n\nOn other Skill Shot attempts, firing the ball around the Back Orbit will only\nspot one K-I-S-S letter.\n\nIf you have just received the Free Pass \"Ball Saved\", neither Skill Shot is\navailable.  The Skill Shots are available at the beginning of Multiball,\nhowever.  Any time one Skill Shot is available, the other is, even though the\nK-I-S-S Skill Shot may only be for one letter.\n\nThe third Skill Shot, so to speak, is for the Double Film Letter Combo.\nAfter a Skill Shot which completes K-I-S-S for the F letter in F-I-L-M,\nhitting the Right Saucer for the SLIDE and the M letter in F-I-L-M will award\na Double Film Letter Combo for 4M.  No other combinations will award the\nDouble Film Letter Combo, and there is no Triple.\n\nFree Pass\nThe Free Pass is lit for a certain amount of time after you launch a ball\ninto play.  If it is lit when a ball lands in the drain trough or rolls\nthrough an outlane, you will immediately get the ball back in the plunger\nlane, with the quote, \"Stay cool, Daddy-O\".  If you side drain while the Free\nPass is still on, you can perform a Death Save or Bang Back and keep one ball\nin play with a \"backup\" ball in the plunger lane.  Of course, that's\ncheating...\n\nThere is no Free Pass for Multiball.\n\nF-I-L-M\nIn order to light the Locks, you must complete F-I-L-M.  Completing F-I-L-M\nis cumulative over the course of a game, and must be done once for each\nMultiball.  There is a sequence to be completed in order to collect each\nletter of F-I-L-M.  The only other way to get F-I-L-M letters is through a\nrandom award from the open Snackbar.\n\nCollecting the first F-I-L-M letter (any of them) is worth 2M.  The second is\nworth 4M, the third 6M, and the fourth 8M.  Collecting all four letters in\norder awards the Sequential Film Bonus after the fourth, for an additional\n8M.  It appears that sometimes the order F-L-I-M will also award the 8M; this\nmay or may not be a rather tasteless pun.\n\nF Letter: K-I-S-S\nIn order to spot the F letter in F-I-L-M, you must complete K-I-S-S.  This is\ndone either through a Skill Shot, by hitting the Left Saucer the appropriate\nnumber of times, or through a random award from the open Snackbar.\n\nOn normal difficulty settings, completing the second K-I-S-S lights the Extra\nBall, which is collected by shooting the Center Shot.  Six K-I-S-S'es are\nrequired for the next Extra Ball, and an additional four for each Extra Ball\nthereafter.  This may vary on your machine.  There may also be a limit on\nExtra Balls on your machine.\n\nNote that spotting the F letter from the Snackbar will not light the Extra\nBall if spelling K-I-S-S at that point would have done so.  This is a bug.\n\nI Letter: Snackbar\nIn order to spot the I letter in F-I-L-M, you must open the Snackbar.  This\nis done by lighting all four Menu Targets.  You could also theoretically get\nthe I letter from the Snackbar itself, if you light it, go through Multiball,\nand then hit it and receive the I letter as a random award, but it might not\nbe set up to do this.  On normal difficulty settings, you can spot one Menu\nTarget at a time by hitting the Snackbar.  On hard settings, and after\nscoring at least one Jackpot on normal settings, hitting the Snackbar does\nnot spot Menu Targets.\n\nNote that if Mega Menu is running, or the Snackbar is lit for some award\n(such as Snack Attack), then hitting the Snackbar will not spot Menu Targets.\nHowever, you can hit and light Menu Targets as you would normally, although\nyou cannot see which are \"lit\" and \"unlit\" if you are in Mega Menu.\n\nThe Jet Bumpers rotate the lit Menu Targets, except during Mega Menu.\n\nNote that if you complete the Menu Targets while the Snackbar is already lit,\nthis does not \"stack\" the Snackbar.  It is merely a wasted effort.\n\nL Letter: P-A-I-D\nIn order to spot the L letter in F-I-L-M, you must complete P-A-I-D.  This is\ndone either through a Skill Shot or by rolling the ball through four unlit\nlanes.  The flippers steer the lit lanes in both directions.  The ball is\nmost likely to go upwards through the A and I lanes when it bounces properly\noff of a Jet Bumper, although it may immediately roll back up any lane it has\njust passed through.\n\nCompleting P-A-I-D (\"Thank you, enjoy the film\") advances your Bonus\nMultiplier, to a maximum of 10X.  Completing P-A-I-D after reaching 10X\nawards 5M.\n\nYou can also be awarded the L letter through a random award from the open\nSnackbar.\n\nSee also \"Cows\".\n\nM Letter: SLIDE\nIn order to spot the M letter in F-I-L-M, you must hit the Right Saucer when\nit is lit for the SLIDE.  This is fairly easy, because the SLIDE is always\nlit when the M letter is needed.  You can also be awarded the M letter\nthrough a random award from the open Snackbar, in which case the SLIDE will\nbecome unlit.\n\nThe other awards on the Right Saucer are, in order:\n\n\n Mega Menu\n Playground Award\n Big Millions\n\n\nThese awards are lit one at a time in that order.  Hitting the saucer\ncollects the current award and lights the next.\n\nAfter awarding Big Millions, the Right Saucer returns to Mega Menu for the\nnext award.  The first time you collect the SLIDE, nothing else is awarded;\nhowever, later hits on the SLIDE, to collect the M letter for later\nMultiballs, will award the SLIDE and the currently lit award.\n\nMega Menu\nThe first award lit on the Right Saucer after you collect the first SLIDE is\nMega Menu.  During Mega Menu, all four Menu Targets are flashing.  Hitting\nany one leaves it lit.  Each target is worth 5M, but your total is displayed\nwhen you hit a new target (ie, 5M, 10M, 15M, and 20M).  You have 20 seconds\nto complete this sequence.\n\nThe Jet Bumpers do not rotate the lit Menu Targets during Mega Menu.\n\nPlayground Award\nAfter Mega Menu, the Right Saucer is lit for the Playground Award, which is a\nrandom award.  Possible awards include and are apparently limited to:\n\n\n Jet Bumpers at 1M\n Unlimited Millions\n Intermission Time\n\n\nThe Jet Bumpers award makes each Jet Bumper worth 1M for 25 seconds.  These\npoints are awarded immediately, rather than as bonus.\n\nThe other awards are described in their own sections.\n\nBig Millions\nDuring Big Millions, the Right Ramp is worth 5M for the first hit, then 10M,\nthen 15M, and so on, to no known limit (I've gotten it up to 25M).  This\nsequence lasts for 10 seconds.\n\nThe machine calls out each award for Big Millions in a booming voice, so\neveryone nearby gets very impressed.\n\nUnlimited Millions\nDuring Unlimited Millions, the Left Ramp is worth 3M for the first hit, then\n6M, then 9M, and so on, to no known limit (I've gotten it up to 24M).  This\nsequence lasts for 24 seconds.\n\nThe Left Ramp shots during Unlimited Millions count towards the Double\nFeature value as normal, so when the sequence ends, shooting the Center Shot\nis a good idea.\n\nIntermission Time\nDuring Intermission Time, both ramps are worth 5M per hit.  This sequence\nlasts for 15 seconds.\n\nRight Ramp\nThe Right Ramp normally functions as the Count Up to Feature, which awards\ncertain sequences after an appropriate number of hits.  The usual sequence is\nSnack Attack at 4, Video Mode at 8, and Super Scoring at 12.  Hitting the\nRight Ramp normally tells you how many hits you have and how many are\nrequired for the next two awards.  If you have between 8 and 12 hits, you are\ntold that Super Scoring is at 12 and Snack Attack at 17, yet getting to Super\nScoring resets the count to 1 and the values are the same as before (on the\nmachines I've played).\n\nThe Right Ramp will not provide its awards during Multiball; in fact, Count\nUp to Feature is superceded by Movie Madness.\n\nSnack Attack\nDuring Snack Attack, the Snackbar is lit for 20M, counting down to a minimum\nof 3M, then ending.  Hit the Snackbar to collect the Attack value.  Some\nmachines appear to end this sequence at 10M.\n\nNotice the music when you collect the Snack Attack value.  Sound familiar?\n\nVideo Mode\nWhen Video Mode is lit, you have to hit the lit Saucer to start it.  It will\nremain lit indefinitely if you do not start it.  Only one Saucer is lit at a\ntime, and the slingshots change the lit Saucer.  I do not know if going\nthrough the entire Count Up sequence a second time and lighting Video Mode\nagain will light both Saucers.  When you light Video Mode, the Right Saucer\nis lit first.\n\nAt the beginning of Video Mode, you discover a Peeping Tom watching you and\nyour girlfriend.  You have to beat him up to complete Video Mode.  Use the\nflipper buttons to punch left and right, while the Peeping Tom tries to duck\nyour blows.  You need 17 hits in 15 seconds to award 15M.  Each subsequent\nVideo Mode requires five more hits, but does not provide any additional time.\nSee also \"Secret Awards\".\n\nSuper Scoring\nThis is an EVERYTHING IS LIT mode, highly reminiscent of many other games.\nThis starts Big Millions, Mega Menu, Intermission Time, Super Creature\nFeature, and probably some other things which I've forgotten as well.\n\nSuper Scoring is started by getting 12 Right Ramps, and then shooting the\nSnackbar before it times out.\n\nThe entire sequence only lasts 20-25 seconds, so you have to pick something\nand concentrate on it.  Also, it appears that if you do not hit Super\nCreature Feature immediately, the diverter closes and you cannot collect it.\n\nThe 10M, 20M, and 30M lights on the Left Inlane are lit during Super Scoring,\nand apparently only then, but they still do not appear to do anything.\n\nSuper Creature Feature\nThis mode comes only during Super Scoring when you hit the Left Ramp.  The\nramp diverter activates and your ball is fed into the Whirlpool.  The first\nspin of the Whirlpool is worth 5M, the next is 10M, and so on.  At 35M, the\ngame stops awarding points - see \"Secret Awards\".\n\nMove Your Car\nA certain number of Center Shots will start the Move Your Car sequence.  The\ndefault setting is to start the first Move Your Car at 5 shots.  The number\nof shots required for the next Move Your Car depends on how well or poorly\nyou did with the last Move Your Car sequence.  If you do well, the next\nsequence is at 8 additional shots.  If you fail miserably, only 3 additional\nshots are required.\n\nAt the beginning of Move Your Car, someone rudely parks their large car in\nfront of you, blocking your view of the screen.  You have to try to get them\nto move... through rather forceful persuasion.  Move Your Car starts counting\ndown from 8M, bottoming out at 3M before ending.  If you hit the Center Shot\nbefore Move Your Car times out, you are awarded that value and an animation\nof attempting to blow up the offending car with a load of TNT (this does\nminimal damage to surrounding vehicles, but does not affect your nemesis).\n\nYou then have 15 seconds to collect double that value by shooting the Center\nShot.  This value does not count down.  The 2X Move Your Car animation is an\nattack with a rocket launcher, which flips over nearby cars, but leaves our\nenemy unaffected.  The 3X Move Your Car animation is a flamethrower (complete\nwith our own asbestos suit), which destroys nearby cars and leaves the screen\nin burning tatters, but leaves our enemy unaffected.  The 4X Move Your Car\nanimation is a 1950's style nuclear bombing which reduces the entire theatre\nsite to a mushroom cloud and the scent of burned popcorn, but leaves our\nenemy unaffected.  There is no 5X shot, although there would be time for one\nif the sequence is executed perfectly.\n\nThe 2X, 3X, and 4X awards all run off of the same 15 second timer without\nresetting.  However, the timer pauses while the ball is in the Jet Bumpers.\n\nAt the end of Move Your Car, whether completed or not, the offending car\nquietly drives off (unharmed), and your total for the sequence is displayed.\nNote that the total is potentially 1X+2X+3X+4X = 10X, for a maximum value of\n80M.\n\nBecause of this ending animation, there is no grace period.  The entire\nsequence can (cruelly) end while the ball is going up the Center Shot lane.\n\nSnackbar\nThe Snackbar must be opened by hitting all four Menu Targets, or spotting\nthose Menu Targets by hitting the unlit Snackbar (only on normal settings and\nbefore collecting any Jackpots).\n\nAfter you have lit and collected the Snackbar once, hitting the closed\nSnackbar is worth 1100K, with a strangely familiar tune (La Cucaracha).\nSubsequent Snackbar Score awards on the same ball are 100K more.\n\nThe Snackbar light is flashing when the Snackbar is open, off when originally\nclosed, and lit when you can get the Snackbar Score (after opening it and\ncollecting an award).\n\nOnce the Snackbar is lit, hitting it provides a random award.  There are\nseveral joke items on the random menu, which are never awarded, such as \"A\nNew Car\" and \"Hula Hoop\".  Possible awards include:\n\n\n Letter in F-I-L-M\n Multiball\n X-tra Ball Countdown\n Extra Ball\n Light Special (EXIT lights on Outlanes)\n Special\n Menu Items (various)\n\n\nThe various menu items are worth different point values, but not much.\n\nI have never seen the game actually award Multiball, but it seems to only\nappear when the Locks are already lit.\n\nThe Xtra Ball Countdown is lit on the Left Ramp for 25 seconds, and hitting\nthe ramp lights the Extra Ball on the Center Shot.  The Extra Ball itself\nwill remain lit until you collect it (across balls).\n\nI believe the Special EXIT lights remain lit for the rest of the game;\nhowever, the game greatly prefers to simply award the Special itself from the\nSnackbar.\n\nOther (non-obvious) items are described in their own sections.\n\nSee \"Secret Awards\" for goodies about the Snackbar.\n\nDouble Feature\nThe Double Feature is a combo shot (the other is the Double Film Letter\nCombo).  You make this combo by shooting the Left Ramp at least once, and\nthen the Center Shot while it remains lit.  Hitting the Left Ramp once sets\nthe Double Feature value to 500K (it's actually the Right Inlane which is\nlabeled \"Start Combo\", but it doesn't do anything unless you've just hit the\nLeft Ramp).  Every subsequent hit on the Left Ramp before the Double Feature\ntimes out (hitting other targets in the meantime does not automatically reset\nthe Double Feature, unlike most combo shots) will double the Double Feature\nvalue.  The maximum for this is 16M on normal and hard settings, but may be\nhigher on easy settings.  Hit the Center Shot to collect the Double Feature\nvalue before it times out.  The Double Feature value times out all at once,\nrather than counting back down.\n\nNote that the Double Feature value is displayed in the animation for hitting\nthe left ramp, but you are not told that the Double Feature value has reached\nits maximum until you hit it one extra time.  Learn the maximum Double\nFeature value for your machine and remember it.\n\nMultiball\nCreature is a very goal-oriented game, and Multiball is the goal.\nSpecifically, large Jackpots and Super Jackpots are the goal, and they are\nrewarded in proportion to their great importance.  Although it is possible to\nget moderately good scores on Creature without having truly remarkable\nMultiballs, you'll always do much better if you do well with Multiball on top\nof everything else.  It's also a \"shortcut\" to high scores.\n\nIn order to start Multiball, you have to complete F-I-L-M, and then lock the\nball in either the Left or Right Saucer (the intense flashing strobes are\nstrong clues to this).  This will give you a second ball at the plunger, as\nthe Movie animation begins.  You can watch the cool animation (ALL the\nanimations in Creature are cool), or just go ahead and put the second ball\ninto play.\n\nOnce Multiball has begun, three Search targets are lit.  These are the Left\nand Right Saucers and the Snackbar.  These targets represent caves into which\nthe Creature may have taken the Girl.  You have to shoot these targets until\nyou find the cave where the Creature and Girl are.  This is entirely random -\nit may be the first cave you choose, or the second, or you may have to shoot\nall three.  No cave seems to be more common than any other.\n\nWhen you find the Creature and Girl (\"There she is!\"), you are awarded 5M\ntimes the Playfield Multiplier.  The Snackbar is then lit for the Rescue.\nShoot the Snackbar to Rescue the Girl, for 10M times the Playfield\nMultiplier.  This lights the Jackpot at the Snackbar.  Shoot the Snackbar to\ncollect the Jackpot times the Playfield Multiplier.  You then need a certain\nnumber of Jet Bumper hits to light the Super Jackpot.  The number of hits\nrequired is a reflexing value, and tends to be between 10 and 30.  Once you\nhave done that, shoot the Snackbar to collect the Super Jackpot times the\nPlayfield Multiplier.\n\n\"You saved my life!\"\n\nCollecting the Super Jackpot immediately doubles the base Jackpot value,\nfor the rest of the game.  The next Super Jackpot has the same effect.  There\nis no limit on the Super Jackpot value other than the internal 10B limit.\n\nAfter collecting the Super Jackpot, Multiball effectively restarts, with the\nSearch targets lit again.  The second time through on the same Multiball, the\nSearch and Rescue awards are doubled, in addition to the Playfield\nMultiplier.  The third time through on the same Multiball, these values are\ntripled.  This may or may not reach some limit.\n\nIf you go through the entire sequence more than once, exactly twice as many\nJet Bumper hits are required to light the second Super Jackpot, exactly three\ntimes as many for the third, and so on.  There is probably some maximum for\nthis, but I have heard of it reaching at least 75 hits.\n\nThe base Jackpot value starts at roughly 40M at the beginning of the game.\nIt is increased by roughly 200K per Jet Bumper hit over the course of the\ngame, apparently without limit (I've seen it around 125M before ever being\ncollected).  The Super Jackpot value is always exactly double the base\nJackpot value.\n\nThe Playfield Multiplier is 1X at the beginning of each Multiball.  The Left\nRamp diverter is activated during Multiball, and balls are fed into the\nWhirlpool, where each trip of the sensor spots a letter in CREATURE.\nCREATURE letters are worth 1M each, subject to the Playfield Multiplier like\nall other values.  Completing CREATURE increases the Multiplier by one\nfactor, to a maximum of 4X on normal settings, 3X on hard settings, or 5X on\neasy settings.  This Playfield Multiplier does apply to Jackpots and Super\nJackpots, so it is very important to high scoring.\n\nNote that you are not told that the Playfield Multiplier has reached its\nmaximum until you complete CREATURE one extra time.  Learn the maximum\nPlayfield Multiplier value for your machine and remember it.\n\nAfter the first Multiball, all CREATURE letters are only 1M, not subject to\nthe Playfield Multiplier.  This is apparently to discourage gyrating the\nmachine for hundreds of CREATURE letters on every Creature Ramp shot.\n\nIf you light and start a second Multiball on a single ball, the Playfield\nMultiplier will be the same as at the end of the previous Multiball, although\nit will not be displayed correctly at first.\n\nIf you land the ball in the Whirlpool at any time other than Multiball or\nSuper Creature Feature, or have it in there as Multiball ends, each spin is\nonly worth 500K.\n\nIf the game thinks that the Whirlpool is malfunctioning, it will award 3\nletters as soon as you shoot the Creature Ramp.  This happens if the\nWhirlpool switch has not been triggered in 90 consecutive balls, which is not\ntoo unlikely after a day or two of unskilled play.  If the switch is in fact\nworking, it will still award letters, and the game will no longer give the 3\nfree letters after the first time.\n\nIf you lose a ball during Multiball without collecting a Jackpot, you are\noffered 14 seconds to shoot the Snackbar to restart Multiball.  Note that\nthis timer does not pause while the ball is in the Jet Bumpers (other game\ntimers such as Move Your Car do pause under these conditions).  Shooting\nthe restart will resume Multiball in exactly the same state it was before,\nincluding Search targets, Rescue, CREATURE letters, and Playfield\nMultipliers.  However, you cannot restart that Multiball again.\n\nOn normal settings, collecting a Jackpot during Multiball will make certain\nthings more difficult in obtaining later Multiballs.  For example, shooting\nthe unlit Snackbar will no longer spot a Menu Target.  You will also no\nlonger be offered the full K-I-S-S Skill Shot.\n\nIf you start Multiball during a timed sequence such as Unlimited Millions or\nMove Your Car, the feature will be suspended during Multiball play.  Once\nMultiball has ended, the feature will immediately resume with its full\ntimer, rather than the value of the timer when you started Multiball.  This\nmakes it possible to effectively double the amount of time available for most\nsequences.  These sequences reset their timer and their value to the\nstarting values.\n\nThere is something called Movie Madness lit on the Right Ramp during\nMultiball.  Apparently, the Right Ramp is worth 500K, increasing by 500K for\nevery shot thereafter during Multiball.  Not really worth shooting for in\ncomparison to the Multiplied Jackpots and Super Jackpots.  Movie Madness\nappears to remain lit, but not flashing, once Multiball ends if you've hit it\nat least once.  I do not think that this is very useful.\n\nHitting the Right Ramp after hitting all four Snackbar targets during\nMultiball lights Monster Madness on the right ramp for roughly 10 seconds\n(you are made aware of this by an intense strobe).  Shooting the right ramp\nawards Monster Madness, which is a simple 4M (times the Playfield Multiplier,\nof course) and a goofy picture of the Creature.  You may be able to collect\nthis more than once, by hitting all four Snackbar targets again.  It may even\nbe worth more the second time around.  But with enormous Jackpots and Super\nJackpots waiting to be collected, why bother?\n\nNote that if you run the base Jackpot value up to 125M and have a 4X\nPlayfield Multiplier, the Super Jackpot will be a clean BILLION points.\n\nEnd-of-Ball Bonus\nI do not know what the end-of-ball bonus is based on.  It never seems to be\nvery large.  I do not believe there is any Hold Bonus in the game.\n\nThe Bonus Multiplier starts at 1X, and proceeds to 2X, 4X, 6X, 8X, and a\nmaximum of 10X.  However, the Bonus Multiplier is not applied correctly to\nyour end-of-ball bonus base value.  Every increment of the Bonus Multiplier\ndoubles the base value, so that 6X is actually 8X, 8X is 16X, and 10X is 32X.\nNevertheless, it's usually not an enormous value.\n\nOne notable feature of Creature is that you can Hurry Up the countdown of the\nbonus by flipping.  This feature would be especially welcome in some other\ngames.\n\nSecret Awards\nAll of the secret awards which involve flipping at some point or another can\ngenerally be obtained by holding both flippers up at the appropriate moment.\nFlipping vigorously may or may not work.  Doing this at several points in the\ngame will lead to Secret Awards, which probably aren't worth many (or any)\npoints, but are extremely amusing and tend to impress crowds even long after\nyou've grown tired of them.\n\nHolding the flippers as the Snackbar opens awards \"NO MORE BAD FOOD\" and\nblows up the Snackbar.  It is rumoured that this tends to make the awards\nfrom the Snackbar more pleasant (less likely to be food), but I doubt it.\nNote that you have to hold the flippers before the lights come on in the\nanimation and the sign says \"OPEN\".\n\nHolding the flippers as the Snackbar attendant gives you a menu item will\nearn the quote \"Come here, punk\", while a hand reaches out and chokes the\nattendant, labeled \"Choking Fatality\".  This choking goes on for quite a\nwhile after the animation ends - listen closely.\n\nFlipping at the end of Video Mode, when your opponent is dazed and the\ndisplay says \"KNOCKOUT\", will knock his head completely from his body (which\nis rather gruesome), and is labeled \"FATALITY\".  \"There's more where that\ncame from!\"\n\nA ball which goes around the Back Orbit of the game when it has not been shot\nfrom the plunger awards the Sneak-In Bonus, which is 1M the first time, 2M\nthe second, and so on.  A very fast shot up the Center Shot is the best way\nto try to get this.  It's easy on some machines.  The ball then comes\nscreaming down the Left Saucer Lane.  Unfortunately, it's usually preferable\nto have the ball stay in the P-A-I-D Lanes instead.\n\nWhen you reach 35M in Super Creature Feature, the game stops awarding\npoints, and the display says \"DON'T BE GREEDY\".  Presumably this is to stop\nDiner-style play from keeping the ball going in the Whirlpool forever.  It's\nactually quite hilarious.\n\nCows\nWhen you complete the P-A-I-D Lanes and are shown the animation with the\nquote \"Thank you, enjoy the show\", watch the lower right corner of the\ndisplay.  As the animation \"smears\" out, you will see a standing cow facing\nleft.  This is not a joke.\n\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\nNote that everything important in Creature - that is, all the playfield\nfeatures which you need to see - are obscured in one way or another.  The\nCreature Ramp obscures the Left Ramp entrance, the Snackbar, and the Center\nShot.  The Inlanes and Outlanes are obscured by habitrails and the Whirlpool.\nYour best bet for getting around these challenges in the design is to get the\nhang of moving your head around as you play, to look at what you need to\nshoot for, and to line up repetitive shots like K-I-S-S.  This style of play\nis really worth working on for Creature, more so than for any other machine\nI've ever seen.\n\nIf you want to try for the free K-I-S-S skill shot, generally letting go of\nthe plunger (at full strength, but not with any extra force) as all four\nletters are lit will put the ball through the sensor as the four letters are\nlit again, thereby completing K-I-S-S for free.  You then have to do\nsomething safe and useful with the ball that's screaming towards the left\nflipper.  I recommend slapping it towards the Right Ramp or Right Saucer.  If\nit happens to hit a post and come right back for a Center Drain, well, you\ncan't say I didn't warn you.  However, Free Pass should be lit.\n\nBecome very familiar with the rules to Creature.  You should know what to do\nat all times - that is, how to score each letter in F-I-L-M, and which ones\nyou still need.  And then you should know the sequence for Multiball.  It's\nall written down above...\n\nIf you aren't in Multiball, you'll probably want to work on starting\nMultiball.  Other interesting things which you may want to pick up along the\nway are the various Right Saucer awards, an Extra Ball from K-I-S-S, Move\nYour Car from Center Shots, some Double Features (mostly only worth doing for\npractice), and Right Ramp awards, especially Super Scoring.  But the biggest\npoints are definitely in Multiball with multiplied Jackpots and Super\nJackpots.\n\nAt some point during Multiball, you'll want to run up the Playfield\nMultiplier.  You can do this at any time, as long as it's before you\ncollect any Jackpots.  Well, you can do it at any time, of course, but it's\nreally worth running it up as early as possible, and it also keeps a ball\noccupied for a while.  The best thing to do is hold one ball on the left\nflipper and repeatedly shoot the other ball through the Creature Ramp.  Small\nnudges forward as the ball moves across the sensor in the Whirlpool will\nimprove its momentum enough to earn you an extra couple of letters.  Without\nthis, you may get only three or four letters per Ramp shot.  On some\nmachines, though, you can easily get ten or twelve letters at a time.  And of\ncourse, if there is no Tilt on your machine, you can really shake the machine\nand get hundreds of letters.  They're eventually worth 4M each (during the\nfirst Multiball).  As soon as you reach the maximum multiplier on your\nmachine, shoot the Jackpot with the ball held on the left flipper (if you\nprefer, you can wait until the ball falls from the Whirlpool, and you can put\nit somewhere else, either back up the Creature Ramp or through the Center\nShot, which will put it in the Jet Bumpers to start working towards the Super\nJackpot).\n\nNote that the behavior of the Whirlpool generally depends on how steep the\nmachine is.  If it's very steep, it will be very difficult to get balls up\nthe Creature Ramp during Multiball, but you'll get plenty of letters from the\nfast-moving ball.  If it's shallow, it will be easy to get up there (you can\neven backhand it), but you'll probably only get 4-6 letters.\n\nIf you can hit the Snackbar reliably from the right flipper with a moving\nball, you can shoot the Rescue and/or Jackpot using a ball which has just\nleft the Snackbar or Whirlpool, without ever letting the other ball off of\nthe left flipper.\n\nNote that putting more than one ball into the Whirlpool at a time is\ngenerally a bad idea - the two balls will not be moving at the same speed,\nand will collide and lose momentum.  In any case, two balls hitting the\nsensor in rapid succession will only trigger one hit.  Worst of all, the two\nballs will fall from the Whirlpool right next to each other, and then you\nhave to deal with them both quickly.  You can, however, put a ball into the\nCreature Ramp as the other ball is losing momentum in the Whirlpool.  The new\nball will take a while to reach the Whirlpool, by which time the first ball\nshould be out of the way (and perhaps resting on your raised right flipper,\nwaiting for another Ramp shot).\n\nThere is no rubber on the pins dividing Outlanes from Inlanes.  It's best to\navoid letting the ball wander towards Outlanes at all.  The only shot which\nrequires letting the ball get out of control is shooting for the Menu\nTargets.  Using the unlit Snackbar to spot these is greatly preferred.\nOtherwise, the ball should never be out of control.  Missed shots at the Left\nRamp or the Snackbar will generally require slap saves.  Balls rolling down\nthrough either Saucer Lane should roll in front of the slingshot on that\nside, without triggering it.  If the ball is hitting the top of the\nslingshot, or triggering the slingshot, your table needs adjustment, either\nfor the slingshot sensitivity, or more likely for the steepness and side\nlean.\n\nThere is an option for installing rubber on the dividing pins, but I have\nnever seen it used.\n\nLocking the ball in the Left Saucer to start the Movie (Multiball) will give\nyou a free shot at the Left Saucer or the Creature Ramp.  Locking on the\nother side will give you a more difficult shot at the Snackbar or Right\nSaucer with a moving ball (these are shots very much worth perfecting,\nthough).\n\nTypically, the sticking point for starting Multiball is the P-A-I-D lanes or\nthe Snackbar (the K-I-S-S can be shot repeatedly any time you have the ball\non the right flipper, which is more often than you'll find the ball on the\nleft flipper).  It may be wise to avoid completing the P-A-I-D lanes during\nMultiball or after completing them once if you expect to be needing them to\nstart another Multiball.  That is, leave just two or three lit.\nUnfortunately, the lit Menu Targets are reset to unlit after each Multiball.\n(K-I-S-S and P-A-I-D are preserved, however.)\n\nNote that one way to get the ball from the right flipper to the left flipper\nis by backhanding the Right Ramp.  It really isn't very steep at all, and the\nentrance is rather wide.  On some machines, this may be a fairly easy shot.\nOn the other hand, repeated Right Ramp shots can be quite challenging,\nbecause the ball comes off of the ramp at quite a different speed (faster)\nthan it entered, making the timing rather erratic.  Also, unfortunately, the\nsign at the entrance of the Right Ramp can actually get in the way of a\nfast-moving ball.\n\nCreature features patented DotMation and Synchro-Sound, whatever those are.\nIt is worth noting that the game doesn't seem to have any of the usual\nproblems with some displays flickering or not paging correctly.  However,\nthere are some cases where sound effects are delayed unacceptably, such as\nwhen you are told to \"Shoot the Snackbar!\" four or five seconds after\nMultiball has ended and nothing is lit at the Snackbar.\n\nThe Music\nThe music in Creature is selected from five 50's tunes, played in \"three-day\nrotation\" - whatever that means, exactly.  That's the description in the\npromotional flyer.\n\nThe five songs are:\n\n Rock Around The Clock\n Get a Job\n Summertime Blues\n Hand Jive\n Red River Rock (Johnny and the Hurricanes)\n\n\nThe Movie\nThe movie on which this pin is themed is a 1954 Black & White classic from\nUniversal Pictures.  It has recently been re-released as part of the\n\"Universal Monsters\" series.  It was originally shot in 3-D, but this\nversion is apparently unavailable.  It features some truly classic underwater\nphotography, lots of orchestral music in classic horror film style, and many\nscenes which are almost identical to the movie-related scenes in the pin's\nanimations.  The Girl and the Hero in the movie even look almost exactly like\nthey do in the animations.\n\n(Note - the 3-D version is not necessarily unavailable.  I've heard that some\ndrive-ins [yes, they still exist] and theatres have been showing it!)\n\nThere were two sequels to the movie, \"Revenge of the Creature\", and \"The\nCreature Walks Among Us\".  I've heard that these are not generally considered\nworth seeing.  Nevertheless, they have both been released on videotape as\npart of the Universal Monsters series.\n\n\"The Girl\" has a name: Kay.\n(She's also a smoker ;)\n\nBragging\nMy own personal high score on Creature, with a very sensitive Tilt and\ndefault factory settings, is 1105M.  My highest Super Jackpot is 386M plus\nchange.  But hey, I haven't played it very much... or at least, haven't found\nany easy machines (even the 1105M wasn't easy, but I was playing well that\nday).\n\nMark Conant has gotten 16.6B on Creature, I am told.  Lyman Sheats got bored\nafter 20B - can you blame him?\n\nContributors\ndstewart_@_cmu.edu\nscott_@_fedora.gfdi.fsu.edu\nbowen_@_leland.stanford.edu\nteyssier_@_guild.net\n\nAnd thanks to everyone else who has sent notes and information which has\ncontributed to this Guide.\n\nI do not speak for my employer, my friends, my relatives, or my cat.

{"page_content": "                 \tBK's PAPA 4 Strategy Guide\n\t\t   --------------------------------------\n\t\t   Bally's Creature from the Black Lagoon\n\n--- Tournament Settings ---\n\n\t\"Free Pass\" (ball saver) is disabled.\n\tThe Snackbar targets do not rotate, as they usually do when a bumper is\nhit.  The Snackbar itself does not spot a Snackbar target when hit.\n\tAwards from the Snackbar (when open) are always a specific point award\nor mode, probably a 4M award or something.\n\tDuring multiball, the scoring multiplier maxes at 3x.\n\tPossibly, the Playground Award from the Slide will be fixed.\n\tPossibly, the girl's location in multiball will be fixed and known, or\nall three shots may be required.\n\tPossibly, it may require more Right Ramps to light Snack Attack, Video\nMode, and Super Scoring.\n\tPossibly, there may be no multiball restart.\n\tIn general, round timers will be shorter than usual.\n\tNo replays or extra balls.  In general, Bly/Wms games do not give point\nawards for doing something which would normally collect an extra ball or\nspecial.\n\n--- Skill Shot ---\n\n\tDropping the ball into the flashing PAID lane completes PAID for a\nbonus multiplier and \"L\" toward multiball.\n\tPlunging past the PAID lanes is a timed skill shot, which awards from\none to all of the letters in \"KISS\".  After collecting \"KISS\" from this skill\nshot, it will only spot one letter in \"KISS\" from then on.\n\n--- General Strategies ---\n\nMultiball: Light multiball by completing F-I-L-M.\n\t\tF -- complete \"KISS\" by shooting the left sink four times, or\n\t\t     by the Skill Shot.\n\t\tI -- shoot all four Snackbar targets.\n\t\tL -- complete \"PAID\" by the top 4 rollover targets, or by the\n\t\t     Skill Shot.\n\t\tM -- shoot the Slide (right hole) once.\n\n\tLetters in FILM are worth 2M, 4M, 6M, 8M, and an additional 8M if you\nlight them in order.  Once FILM is complete, either the left sink or right hole\nwill start a two-ball multiball.\n\tDuring multiball, you must search for the stolen girl.  The left sink,\nSnackbar, and right hole are lit; shooting the correct hole finds the girl.\nThen, shooting the Snackbar rescues her, and another Snackbar shot collects the\nJackpot.  Then 25 bumper hits are required, after which the Super Jackpot\n(twice the Jackpot) is lit at the Snackbar.  The entire sequence (without a\nSuper Jackpot) is worth about 1OO million, 2OO if you get a Super Jackpot.\n\tTo make multiball more lucrative, the Left Ramp can be shot during\nmultiball.  The ball is fed to a whirlpool saucer, and eight revolutions make\neverything 2x for the rest of the multiball.  Eight more make everything 3x,\nthe limit.  Collecting a 3x Jackpot is worth at least 12O million, a 3x Super\nJackpot should be worth upwards of 3OO million.\n\tMultiball is the way to go on this machine if you want a high score,\nsomething competitive with the scores you can get on some other PAPA games.\n\n\nMove Yer Car: Shoot the center shot five times to begin the round.  Then the\n\tcenter shot counts down from 8M to 3M; shoot it!  If you're successful,\n\tthe center shot is then lit for 2x, 3x, then 4x the collected value,\n\tall in the next 15 seconds.  After the round ends, you must make eight\n\tmore center shots to start it again.\n\n\tA perfect Move Yer Car is worth 8O million.  Not as much as multiball,\nbut much easier to get to.  Note that the center shot is makeable from either\nflipper.\n\n\nSlide Modes: The first shot to the right hole (the Slide) won't award anything\n\texcept a loud noise, but each shot after that starts one of three Slide\n\tmodes.  In order, they are:\n\t\tMega Menu: 15 secs, each Snackbar target worth 5M.\n\t\tPlayground: a random mode starts -- usually it is Unlimited\n\t\t\tMillions, which makes the Left Ramp worth 3M, 6M, 9M,\n\t\t\tetc. for about 2O seconds.  Big scoring potential.\n\t\tBig Millions: Right Ramp 5M, 1OM, etc. for 1O seconds.\n\n\tEach of these has a high scoring potential, especially Unlimited\nMillions, which can be worth nearly 1OOM if done perfectly.\n\n\nRight Ramp: Shots to the Right Ramp are counted.  Reaching a number of ramps\n\tlights an award.\n\t\t4 Ramps lights Snack Attack, a slow hurry-up countdown from\n\t\t\t2OM.  Collect at the Snackbar.\n\t\t8 Ramps lights Video Mode at the Slide.  Punch with the\n\t\t\tflippers.  Worth 25M if you knock the guy out (easy).\n\t       12 Ramps lights Super Scoring at the Snackbar for 12 seconds.\n\t\t\tShoot the Snackbar to begin the mode, during which\n\t\t\t-everything- is lit; both ramps for Millions, Snack\n\t\t\tAttack, Mega Menu, and the whirlpool for 5M, 1OM, etc.\n\t\t\tper spin.  Potential for 1OOM or so during this mode.\n\n\tNote that the right ramp can be shot from either flipper, and comes out\nat full speed to the left.  A good combination is Right Ramp -> pass to right\nflipper -> Right Ramp -> repeat.  The Ramp rounds are worth good points, but\ndefinitely go for Super Scoring if you get anywhere near 12 ramps.\n\n\nKISS loop: One strategy some people might use is to just keep shooting the KISS\n\tshot over and over again.  It's only worth 5OOK per shot, but hey.\n\n\n--- Point-Specific Strategy ---\n\nIf you need...\tTry doing this!\n\n5 million:\tStart the next Slide mode.  Any of them open easy shots for at\n\t\tleast that much.\n2O million:\tStart a Slide mode, or go for Right Ramps until a mode starts\n\t\tfrom there.\n5O million:\tAny of the above; also, go for a Move Yer Car round.\n1OO million:\tStart multiball, or try the Unlimited Millions round from the\n\t\tSlide.\n2OO million\n   and over:\tGo for multiball.  The scoring potential there is very high,\n\t\teven though it's pretty difficult.\n\n\n--- Techniques ---\n\nFlipper Passing: A post transfer works pretty well on Creature; however, it may\n\tbe easier to make a shot that allows for a transfer.  From the left,\n\tthe Snackbar kicks the ball to the right flipper.  From the right,\n\teither ramp works well -- the Right Ramp brings the ball to the left\n\tflipper at high speed, and the Left Ramp allows you to transfer the\n\tball by holding up the right flipper.\n\nDeath Saves: Not likely -- as usual, it depends on the game's tilt sensitivity,\n\tand games at PAPA tournaments tend to be quite sensitive.  As an\n\tadvantage, Creature's end-of-ball bonus tends to be very low.\n\nBang Backs: Bang Backs have been done on Creature, but I really doubt they'll\n\tbe possible at PAPA.\n\nNudging: Depending on the sensitivity, it is a good idea to nudge the ball\n\taround the whirlpool (during multiball), since it is worth a lot toward\n\tjackpots.  The inlane posts are metal, so nudging away from them is\n\tpretty hard.  In general, Creature is a ball-control game, so the ball\n\tshouldn't be near the outlanes much to begin with.\n\n\n--- Scoring ---\n\n\tAverage scores on Creature (A division) will probably be around 1OO\nmillion, with the highest scores coming in around 3OO to 5OO million.  In all,\nCreature's a pretty low-scoring game, but it has the potential for a break-out\nscore from Super Jackpots.\n\nHigh Scores to Date:\tMark Conant (CA)\t16.65 billion\n\t\t\tDave Stewart (PA)\t 2.53 billion\n\t\t\tBowen Kerins (RI)\t 1.67 billion\n\n--- For More Info ---\n\n\tIf you need Creature's full rules, get Kevin Martin's rule sheet by\nanonymous ftp.  FTP rahul.net; go to the Pinball Archive (cd pub/sigma/pinball)\nand type \"get Rules/creature\".\n\tIf you'd like to know the exact tournament settings for Creature, or\nother information, it should be available at PAPA 4.  I'll try to get the best\ninformation I can before the tournament.\n\tIf there's anything you'd like to add to this, just contact me:\nbowen@cardinal.stanford.edu.  I'd especially like to hear a high score for the\nlist, since I don't like to put myself in the top three.\n\n\tHope this helps; other Strategy Guides should be around as fast as I\ncan dish 'em out.\n\nBowen Kerins\nbowen@cardinal.stanford.edu\n\"It's dark in here!...

{"page_content": "From: sgrant@er6.rutgers.edu (Sean Grant)\nSubject: VFBTF #6 - Demo Man, CFTBL tricks, and other rgp topics\nDate: 31 Mar 94 22:39:23 GMT\n\n  Sean Joseph Grant's Strategies and Hints for Creature from the Black Lagoon\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     On Ball 1, shoot for the K-I-S-S letters, by pulling the plunger all the\nway back, and then releasing when the K is the only one lit.  This is usually\nsuccessful, however plunger strengths will vary.  If you hit the switch at the\nright time and get the full smooch, then aim for the Slide right away.  If\nyou hit it, and you will if you practice, you receive a Double Film Letter\nCombo and 4M in addition to the 6M for the F and M in Film.  If you miss the\nSlide, drain immediately, if your machine has Free Pass enabled, so you can\nshoot again, this time shooting softly enough that you can start working on\nP-A-I-D.\n\n    If you hit the receive the combo, aim for the Slide again, (Slide-Slide\ncombos aren't usually too rough if you hit the ball late on the fly) so you\ncan start Mega Menu and then begin to work on.....\n\n    Lighting the I -  Try to make sure that you shoot the Slide twice first,\n                      before going after the blue Snackbar Targets.  That way\n                      you'll get both the Mega Menu awards, and work towards\n                      the I at the same time.\n\n    Lighting the L -  Completing the PAID rollovers isn't too hard, if you\n                      either shoot the flashing value (PAID rewarded right\n                      away) or if you let the ball drain for FREE PASS on\n                      balls 2 and 3, guaranteeing you the L if you lane\n                      change correctly.  Try to take advantage of the\n                      fact that the left flipper moves the targets left and\n                      vice versa even though older games have trained you to\n                      rely on one directional lane change.  Also, make sure\n                      that a lit letter isn't hiding behind the flashing\n                      value before you shoot the ball by flipping through all\n                      the possible lit lane locations.\n\n    Subsequent Multiball Set Ups -\n    Let's face it, bonus doesn't mean jack in this game.  So in Multiball,\n    don't complete P-A-I-D.  Leave one rollover unlit, so that when Multiball\n    ends it will only take one Move Your Car shot to score you the L again.\n\n    This is the same with the K-I-S-S targets.  I'm sure that players will be\n    tempted to get two kisses quickly to light the extra ball,  but if you go\n    into Multiball with just one letter lit, you will probably hit that shot\n    at least one more time during the search for the \"girl\" and when Multiball\n    ends you will need only one or two more shots to score the K-I-S-S again.\n\n    Multiball should be much easier to light the second and subsequent times,\n    with the exception of having to hit the snackbar targets directly to score\n    the I.\n\n    Take Advantage of the Slide - The Slide shot is extremely lucrative,\n    especially when the Playground gives you Unlimited Millions.  This is even\n    better than Multiball, except if you can get Super Jackpots.  Last time I\n    played I hit the left the ramp 9 straight times during UM giving me (27 +\n    24 + 21....) M for a total of 136M!  Big Millions is sweet too, but that\n    right ramp is quick, so be ready for quick repetitive shots!\n\n    Multiball Tricks - Even if the left ramp does not wind up rewarding you\n    too many letters in CREATURE, shoot it anyway so that you can detain one\n    of the balls in the ramp and loop while aiming for the appropriate targets\n    with the left flipper.\n\n    - When attempting to light Super Jackpot, if you trap a ball with the left\n      flipper and then keep repeating the center shot with the right, you will\n      have an easy shot at the snackbar as soon as the other ball hits the\n      twentieth jet.\n\n    - If you're really greedy and the left ramp is awarding letters, keep\n      shooting the ramp with the right flipper while trapping left until you\n      reach 5x and then get the \"SUUUUUPPPPEEEERRRRR JACKPOT\" (one of the\n      coolest audio samples in pinball history!)  *- Be careful being too\n      greedy, you only have two balls and you won't get to restart after\n      scoring Jackpot.\n\n    That's about all I can think of.  Some of these things may seem self\n  explanatory, but if you can do most of these tips you will find that you\n  will be able to get real high scores.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Creature from the Black Lagoon", "possible_shots": "K-I-S-S letters, Slide, Snackbar Targets, PAID rollovers, Move Your Car, left ramp, right ramp, center shot", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/creaturefromtheblacklagoon-notes2.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

It is not a mode based and is lots of fun!\n\nPlayfield Description\n\nThe CSI playfield is packed full of goodies. It has a saucer just above the flippers with toys, lanes and targets spread all over the place. It also seems less 3 dimensional than most recent games, due to only having one short ramp, the skull ramp at the top of the field.  \n\nAs the game itself says \"this is a game of 3's\". 3 flippers, 3 bumpers, 3 multiballs, 3 drop targets and 3 interactive toys all on one playfield! No wonder the field looks full. Fitting all this in is where Pat Lawlor's design talent really shines. An example is the looping Suspect Shakedown loop, which contains a spinner, 2 up- posts (to control balls travelling in different directions), a non return gate and an exit gate and that is all in just one lane. It may look crowded it plays nice and smooth.\n\nPlayfield tour, starting from the bottom and moving around clockwise:\n\nThe usual two flipper, sling and out-lane arrangement but with three in-lanes that are used to spell CSI, two left and one on the right. As a result the flipper alignment is slightly off set to the right of centre. \n\nImportant indicator lights are above and between the flippers. There are 3 different coloured rows of 5 Evidence lights that tell you how much evidence you have collected. There is also a column of 3 award lights below the saucer and 3 lamps and between the flippers that indicate when you have completed the 3 multiballs. See \"playing the game\" to find out why these are important. \n\nNote: Collecting Evidence is achieved by completing major game shots when indicated by their own sets of 3 coloured indicator lights.\n\nAbove the left flipper and 1/3 of the way up the play field is the Lab Saucer; beside it on its left is the first of 5 Bullet Targets. Moving further left on the side of the game is a set of 3 DNA drop targets. Already this is an unusual layout but it gets stranger as above the saucer is a mini flipper that can shoot balls diagonally across the playfield to the top right area. \n\nThe \"Suspect Shakedown\" spinner lane loops up and around the left and back of the mini flipper and in front of a Skull, which is a dominant feature on the playfield. When the lane is hit it feeds the ball though a gate into a small self contained bumper area, which in turn feeds the ball to the mini-flipper. The Skull above locks balls in its eyes and when these balls are released they travel down the same path, through a gate and the bumpers to eventually reach the small flipper. \n\nThe Skull rises up during play to lock balls in its eye sockets for Skull Multiball and is fed by the only ramp in the game. \n\nTo the right of the bumpers is the Centrifuge spinning disk which can be hit by a shot from either of the lower flippers. This is used for-you guessed it, for Centrifuge Multiball! The centrifuge spins the all or occasionally balls round pretty quickly and can at times acts like a shaker motor. \n\nTo the left of the entrance of the Centrifuge is a 2nd Bullet Target. By shooting past the right of the centrifuge you can make a long smooth ramp shot, which then either feeds balls for Skull Locks when lit or back to the right flipper by rails when not lit. Lamps at the entrance to the ramp indicate when locks are lit.\n\nThe Finger Print Spinner is to the right of the ramp entrance and is another long shot from the lower flippers. It turns the ball sharply left into the right hand entrance of the Suspect Shakedown lane, which feeds the bumpers and small flipper.\n\nTop right is the Morgue sink hole that is used for the skill shot. The ball entrance and skill shot lane lane is up the right hand side of the table. If you plunge it to hard the ball loops around to the shakedown lane and the bumpers. \n\nThe same sink hole and VUK can be accessed from the right, from where it becomes the AV Lab. It can be accessed either by shots from the small flipper or lucky bounces in that area. Below that are the two more Bullet Targets that face left for small flipper shots.\n\nDirectly below the sink hole is the model Microscope and below that an associated horseshoe lane, which can be hit from both directions. It contains a magnet that holds the ball for examination and it registers locks for Microscope Multiball. In between the entrances is the last Bullet Target.\n\nBelow that is a very wide right loop shot and finally the manual and auto plungers that sends balls into play up the right of the playfield when appropriate.\n\nRules (software revision 2.4):\n\nSkill shot, Morgue and AV lab sink hole: Skill shot and Morgue scores start at 500K and when lit subsequent shots increase by 100k each time they are scored though out the game. AV Lab awards are also collected here in single ball play and include: 250K, light special (in the out lane), light extra ball (at the saucer) and point awards that start at 325k and increase by 25k thereafter. \n\nSkull multiball: Progress towards Skull MB is indicated by lights at the entrance of the skull ramp. First time around, this is done by hitting the ramp once to light a lock rising up the skull in the playfield and then hitting it again to lock the ball. Once both balls are locked in the skull eye sockets, the balls are released for multiball. This becomes progressively more difficult to do through out the game as it takes more ramp shots to light the lock each time.\n\nSkull MB has 4 levels to complete:\n\n Level 1: you need to shoot 6 shots that are indicated by yellow arrows for 250K each. \n Level 2: lights 6 bullet targets for 500k each\n Level 3 you need to shoot the skull for 750K and repeat within 5 seconds with the 2nd ball for another 750K. \n Level 4: the Morgue and right loop are lit for a 1m and the completion of Skill MB. \n\nYou then go back to level 1 and continue cycling through the levels until for as long as you can keep more than one ball in play. \n\nCentrifuge multiball: Hitting the ball into the centrifuge allows it to spin the ball around for a short time on a spinning disk. Each spin scores 100 points count down the number of spins required to start multiball. First time around it takes about 100 spins to reach zero and the number of spins necessary increases progressively each time you start MB though out the game. Once the spins count reaches zero, the ball is released and the centrifuge becomes a ball lock. Hitting it again triggers an up-post in the entrance that locks the ball. A 2nd ball is auto-plunged into play to start MB. \n\nWith one ball in the Centrifuge you can now build up the jackpot for 20 seconds in 3 ways. You can add 250 points for each switch hit with the ball in play, you can also spin the ball trapped in the centrifuge by pumping the flipper buttons to increase the bonus by 100 points per spin (see Big Wow) or the 3rd option is to hit the centrifuge up post to release the captive ball to start multiball immediately. If you loose the live ball while one is trapped in the centrifuge, then multiball fails to start and you have to do this all again but lets assume you don't.\n\nWith two balls now in play it is time to start collecting your jackpots at whatever value you have managed to set. If you collect a jackpot another shot is lit for a short time for a double jackpot and if that is collected a triple jackpot is briefly lit. If you don't collect them quick enough they revert back to single Jackpots. A triple award counts as completing the MB.\n\nDuring Centrifuge MB it is also possible to score \"Super Spins\" by shooting the Centrifuge. Once the ball is inside it awards 15k per spin. This increases by 1,250 subsequently each time you hit the Centrifuge for Super Spin. There is also a multiplier that increases to match you highest jackpot since your last Super Spin e.g. if it's a single jackpot it in 1x and if a triple would give 3x. It always returns to 1x once Super Spin is collected.\n\nBig Wow: Pump the flipper buttons to make the ball in the centrifuge fly around and the jackpot values increase. You can do this until the whole machine shakes. It's awesome to do this while running stacked multiballs and trying to keep the live balls in play.\n\nMicroscope multiball: This is \"the mother of all multiball modes\" and to complete it you need to complete 6 distinct stages and make at least 23 shots with more than one ball in play.\n\nBefore you can start MB you need to collect enough \"Evidence\". Shooting the Microscope loop will light evidence at all the major shots of the game. There are 3 colours of evidence to collect and you need to collect 5 pieces of evidence of one colour. The first piece awards 600k, the 2nd 700K and so on, up to the 100K for the 5th. Once collected the Microscope area will flash and you start Microscope MB by hitting the microscope loop. The ball is then held by a magnet and \"studied\" while another ball is auto plunged into play and you get 100k award. \n\nNote: When evidence is collected from a shot the lit evidence at that shot changes colour. For the first MB all evidence is lit in one colour but in subsequent multiballs it doesn't all re-set to the same colour. This encourages players to shoot all around the playfield to collect the colour you need. In addition you may have to hit shots up to 3 times to cycle though red and green and blue to collect the specific colour you want. \n\nNow we can start on the 6 stages of the Microscope Multiball:\n\n Stage 1: 5 major shots are lit for jackpots of 275K \n Stage 2: Hit the lit Microscope loop twice in either direction for double Jackpots of 550K\n Stage 3: Hit the Microscope loop in opposite directions for triple jackpots of 875K\n Stage 4: Collect quadruple jackpots by hitting the right orbit or Morgue, as indicated by large arrows for 1,375K.\n Stage 5: Collect shots to light the 15 lamp grid in the centre of the game. That is 3 different coloured rows of 5 and a minimum of 15 shots while keeping more than one ball in play. Each successful shot scores a double jackpot of 550K (7.5m in total).\n Stage 6: hit the Morgue for a \"mega jackpot\" of 5.5m and this completes microscope MB. \n\n\nFrenzies: There are two timed frenzies that you can start at any time during a game. \n\nFingerprint Frenzy is started from the right spinner. Each spin earns 3K and takes you towards the start of the frenzy, as indicated in the dot display. Once started the music moves up a gear and all switches score 10K for 25 seconds. Shooting either spinner is worthwhile as that also leads the ball to the bumpers and decent points. \n\nSuspect Shakedown is a 25 sec timed mode. It is started from the left spinner where initially each spin scores 3K and helps build up a picture of the suspect in the display. After 50 spins the face is complete and the Shakedown begins. This earns you 500K and the 6 major game shots are lit by yellow arrows. You need to shoot them to find the suspects at one of those shots. Finding the suspect collects 1m, while the others begin scoring at 300K, increasing by 100k for each shot made.\n\nBallistics: To start Ballistics you need to collect 6 bullets. Hitting the 5 bullet targets scores 75K/per target, or 250K for the 5th and the 6th bullet is collected at the saucer. This is a 40 second timed mode in which you have to hit all 6 of the flashing bullet shots. The first time this is achieved all are lit but subsequently it becomes more difficult as only one is lit at a time. Awards start at 500k for the first bullet and increase at 50k per shot until it maxes at 750K. Collecting all the bullets ends the mode. \n\nDNA targets and Lab awards: Knocking down each DNA targets scores 25K and knocking down all 3 lights a Lab award, which is collected at the saucer. In single ball play awards include extra ball, 4x bumper values and lighting special/extra ball at the out lanes. In multiball modes it often adds another ball, with up to a maximum of 4 balls on the table at any one time. Lab awards can't be stacked.\n\nPop Bumpers: Bumper values begin at 3k per hit at the start of each ball. Shooting the right orbit adds 1k to their value.\n\nPhoto-award: When the ball exits the bumper area it briefly lights a small flipper shot for the Morgue and a Photo-award. The award is equal to the points scored in by the bumpers in the last visit.\n\nBonus multipliers: The bonus in CSI can form a significant proportion of your overall score.\n\nSpell CSI by hitting the 3 in-lane/rollover switches for 1x bonus and 100k. 1x bonus. This also lights the Lab award, for collection at the saucer for another 1x bonus. When the Lab award is collected it lights the right orbit stop briefly for a further 3x bonus. \n\nLane changing CSI letters is possible by using the flipper buttons and the CSI bonus must be collected at the saucer, as it does not carry over from ball to ball.  \n\nWizard mode: It doesn't have one but If you are successful in all three multiballs, as indicated by lighting 3 indicator lamps between the flippers, then the game offers up a wizard shot for 50m. I have yet to see this but live in hope.\n\nStacking multiballs: This gives you both longer multiball times and bigger jackpots by stacking awards. It also by default gives an increased chance of starting frenzies etc. Skull and Centrifuge MB stack well, as do Centrifuge and Microscope but Skull and Microscope MB don't stack. This is because it isn't possible to continue collecting evidence during Skull MB. \n\nGame Tactics\n\nCSI does a superb job of telling you what to shoot for but even so there are a few strategies that are worth bearing in mind.\n\nLight the \"Evidence\" at the microscope as soon as possible so that subsequent shots count towards Microscope multiball. Use the lane change to light the in lanes for the CSI bonus and shoot the saucer regularly when lit as there are some good awards there. \n\nI usually try and start Skull MB just before Centrifuge and try to stack them if I can. Big points can be achieved through stacking features, such as frenzies and Ballistics with multiballs and then collecting as many goodies as possible. \n\nIt sounds simple but it isn't as the multiballs are very deep and challenging. Don't be too picky as this game is a drain monster if set up correctly. As the game says \"Our victim isn't the only one who's taken a beating\".\n\nOverview\n\nCSI is a fair machine with balanced scoring. The rules are refreshingly easy to understand and the game is good at indicating what to shoot for next. During a game it encourages you to shoot all around the playfield. Accurate shooting and success in multiballs is the key to the game and it is satisfying and smooth to play when you get it right. \n\nThere you have it. An entertaining game, that isn't on rails and doesn't have long ball times, \n\nThanks to Pinball News for their game review, which I consulted regularly while writing this rule sheet.\n\nEddie Mole 2011-03-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Crime Scene Investigation (CSI)", "possible_shots": "3 flippers, 3 bumpers, 3 multiballs, 3 drop targets, 3 interactive toys, Lab Saucer, 5 Bullet Targets, 3 DNA drop targets, Suspect Shakedown spinner lane, Skull ramp, Centrifuge spinning disk, Finger Print Spinner, Morgue sink hole, Microscope and associated horseshoe lane", "manufacturer": "Not mentioned", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/csi.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Crime Scene Investigation (CSI)", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I don't think there is\nanything left, as far as rules go.]\n\nIf you see any mistakes, or want to add anything to this rules sheet,\nplease let me know.\n\nPeople who helped contribute to this sheet are listed at the end.\n\nCBW is probably a registered trademark of Premier Pinball, and all that jazz.\n\nNOTE: This rules sheet is based on the machine I know and love. On hard\nsettings, the max score for a particular feature will be lower\nthan what I have indicated here. Also, for machines w/o the cue ball\ninstalled, the jackpots are nailed with shots to the NO WAY target,\nand the two white targets on the left and right of the horseshoe.\n\nImportant Stuff\n\nThis section describes locations and shots on the playfield that will be\nreferred to in the discussion.\n\n\n THE RAMP  This is pretty obvious! :-) This is the key shot of the whole\ngame. Hitting the ramp while the two red lights are blinking will\naward various things.\n\n CORNER POCKET  This is the eject hole on the left side of the machine above\nthe left outlane.\n\n SIDE POCKET  The two green targets attached to the upper platform where\nthe 8 ball rests. You must hit the cue ball into these targets\nfor various awards.\n\n HORSESHOE  The two holes underneath the side pocket. Sort of a 'Tunnel'\nwhere hitting the ball in one side will allow the ball to\nexit out the opposite side (If hit hard enough).\n\n BANK SHOT  Two eject holes on the top of the machine, one on the left and\none on the right.\n\n POOL LANES  One letter of POOL appears in each outlane and inlane. Either\nflipper button will change which lanes are lit, so a letter\nshould never be repeated.\n\n STRIPES/SOLIDS  These are the drop targets on the upper left and upper right\nsides of the machine. The ones on the left are the 'Solids'\nnumbered 1-7. The targets on the right are the 'Stripes'\nnumbered 9-15.\n\n SWEET SPOT  The white target located in between the two bank shots. This\ntarget gets lit after spelling POOL.\n\n HURRY UP SPECIAL/HURRY UP 10,000,000/HURRY UP  5,000,000  The yellow target just above the Corner Pocket on the\nleft side of the machine.\n\n CHANGE/HURRY UP EXTRA BALL  A target just above the right outline. It has a picture of a\nwagon wheel on it. Hitting this will change the Wagon Wheel\naward, or if lit, will award an extra ball.\n\n NO WAY TARGET  The white target below the side pocket, in between the two\nentrances to the horseshoe.\n\n DOUBLE/WIZARD  These are lights on the bottom of the table. These keep track of\nhow far along each word is spelled. These are cumulative between\ngames, but a Slam Tilt or Power Cycle will reset them both.\n\n\nThe Rules\nThe ramp is the most important shot in the game. The ramp has to be hit once\nto light it for the wagon wheel award. This means after you initially plunge\nthe ball, the ramp will be lit for the first wagon wheel award. Hitting\nthe Corner Pocket will also light the Wagon Wheel, if it's not already lit.\nHitting the ramp after it is lit will start one of the following timed rounds:\n(The current round to be awarded will be flashing in the Wheel above the\nflippers.)\n\n\n ROWDY RAMP  Hit the ball up the ramp as many times as you can in the\ngiven amount of time. The awards are 2 million for the\nfirst shot, then 5 million, 10 million, 20 million and\nfinally 40 million.\n\n HORSESHOE EXTRA BALL  After this round starts, hit the ball in either side of the\nhorseshoe to get an extra ball.\n\n NO WAY  When this round starts, you have to try to hit the NO WAY target\nin between the horseshoe entrances. Each hit scores 30 million.\nThe hard part of this shot it that the Cue Ball is in the way,\nand you must develop various shots to hit the target, or knock\nthe cue ball out of the way long enough to get a clear shot.\n\n SPELL DOUBLE  This round is used to add letters to DOUBLE. The first shot\nto hit is the Corner Pocket. If letters remain after this\nfirst shot, hit the Ramp to add additional letters until\ntime expires. Completing the word DOUBLE doubles every score,\nevery extra ball, and every special you hit during that ball.\nThe double round ends when your ball drains.\n\n COMBO SHOTS  This is a series of 'Countdown' shots. The first is the ramp\nshot, which counts down from 10 million. After hitting the ramp,\nyou must hit either Bank Shot, which starts at 20 million.\nAfter the Bank Shot, hit the Corner Pocket shot, which\ncounts down from 50 million. This round ends after all three\nshots are made, or if one of the countdown scores reaches 0.\n\n SIDE POCKET  Your aim in this round is to hit the Side Pocket as many times\nas you can before time runs out. Every successful shot scores\n10 million, and advances your RACKS (Explained later).\n\n\nIf you are successful in completing all the above Wagon Wheel rounds, the\nRamp is automatically lit for POOL BALL MANIA. Pool ball mania is a 3 ball\nmultiball round, where every target is worth 5 million points. The round ends\nwhen 2 out of 3 balls drain. (When I say every target, I mean the No Way shot,\nthe 1-7 and 9-15 targets, the change targets and the Side Pocket. Slingshots,\nPop Bumpers, In/Outlanes, etc do NOT score 5M a hit.)\n[NOTE: On hard settings, it's 3M a target.]\n\nWARNING--You do NOT collect the pool ball mania bonus until all your balls\nhave drained. This means DON'T TILT or you will forfeit all the\npool ball mania points!\n\nAfter pool ball mania is over, the ramp is lit for NINE BALL PLAY.\n(Note: The ramp will only stay lit for Nine Ball Play for about 99\nseconds. After this, it resets, with Rowdy Ramp being the award.)\nAfter starting this round, your object is knock down the 1-7 drop targets,\nthen hit the 8 ball (Side Pocket). This lights the 9 ball drop target for\n500 million points (or a BILLION if you're in DOUBLE!). After the 9 ball\ntarget is lit, you have about 15 seconds to hit it. After time ends, or you\nhit the 9 ball, the wagon wheel resets, and you begin all over again.\nNote that if your ball drains before you can start Nine Ball Play, the\nramp will be reset at the start of your next ball.\n\n2 BALL MULTIBALL:\nTo light the ramp for 2 ball play, you must first knock down one set of the\ndrop targets. (SOLIDS or STRIPES). You will know which side you need, because\nthe lights above this particular set of targets will be flashing. (Hitting\nthe opposite set of targets will award 500,000 points a piece.)\nAfter completing the targets, the Side Pocket will begin flashing '8 Ball'.\nHitting the Side Pocket will light the ramp for multiball.\nAfter multiball begins, the object is to hit the Side Pocket and knock the\n8 ball into all three color sets on the upper platform for the jackpots.\nThe jackpots start out at 5 million a piece, but hitting any of the drop\ntargets will add 1 million to each remaining jackpot. If all three jackpots\nare hit, the ramp is lit for a Super Jackpot, which scores 100 million. If\nyou hit the Super Jackpot, the whole process resets until one of your\nballs drains. Note that all Wagon Wheel awards can still be collected while\n2 ball is in progress.\n\nOther Scoring\nThe Skill Shot: Before you plunge the ball, the 8 ball on the platform will\nturn back and forth. The object of the skill shot is to plunge the ball\nso that the 8 ball will hit the BLUE targets on the platform for 5 million.\nThis takes a couple of shot to get used to, because you have to lead the\nshot a little bit.\n\nScratch Shot: Hitting the Side Pocket without the 8 ball being lit scores\na Scratch Shot. After 3 Scratch Shots, you get 10 million, and then the\nnext point award occurs at 8 Scratch Shots. (Not sure of how many points.)\n\nCompleting the word POOL lights the ramp for VIDEO MODE. There are two video\nmodes that the machine alternates between.\n\nCATCH THE POOL BALLS: Pool balls will fall from the top of the display, and\nyou must use the flipper buttons to control the pocket to catch them. The\nscoring is 2 million for the first ball caught then 5 million,\n10 million and 20 million.\n\nWHERE'S THE KING: You are presented with 3 curtains, and must choose one\nand hope you find 'The King'. Use the flippers to choose a curtain. You\nget 0 points for finding a Cow Pie, 5 million for Cactus Jack, 10 million\nfor the moose, and 20 million for 'The King'. It has been noted on rgp that\nno matter what curtain you pick, you will get the same award, so this video\nmode is a good time to rest your hands and get another sip of your favorite\nbeverage. :-]\n\nThe SWEET SPOT is lit after POOL is spelled. Hitting the SWEET SPOT awards\n50 million points, and stays lit until the current ball drains. The SWEET\nSPOT can be lit multiple times during a ball.\n\nThe Bank Shot: This is a good way to rack up some points and light some\nspecial things on the playfield. Most bank shots will award some points, then\nanother award. These awards range from advancing the multiplier, advancing\nracks, awarding EVERYTHING, lighting the hurry up special/extra ball,\ncompleting DOUBLE, giving an extra ball, lighting the ramp for wagon wheel\naward, starting the current wagon wheel round, starting video mode, spot\nletters in WIZARD and DOUBLE, scoring 1M, 5M, 10M, completing WIZARD,\nhurry up nine ball, and others.\n\nThere are two types of bank shots:\n\nThe clean Bank Shot is when you make it in to the Bank Shot eject hole\nwithout hitting any bumpers. The clean Bank Shot awards points, plus a\nrandom award. The points are 1 million, 2 million, 5 million, 7 million,\n10 million, 15 million and finally 20 million. It has been my experience\nthat you will receive a clean Bank Shot extra ball in between 5 and 7\nmillion points, but your mileage may vary. You can tell when clean bank shot\nis on because the bank shot lights will be flashing.\n\nThe regular Bank Shot only gives the random award. You can tell it will\nbe a regular bank shot when the Bank Shot lights are not flashing.\n\nNeither bank shot is lit during Multiball or any Wagon Wheel round.\n\nNOTE: After you complete the Pool Ball Mania Round, ALL bank shots are\nclean until nine ball play is over. This is an excellent time to get\nthe extra ball, or get an easy 20M.\n\nRACKS and MULTIPLIER: You advance your multiplier with shots to the Corner\nPocket, or, sometimes, the bank shot. You advance racks during the SIDE\nPOCKET round, and sometimes with the bank shot. RACKS also get advanced\nafter you complete a bank of stripes or solids. When your racks have advanced\nto 4, the hurry up extra ball will light. Your bonus after your ball drains\nis calculated as follows:\n500,000 X Racks X Multiplier\nExample: You have 4 racks, and a multiplier of 2: Your bonus will be\n4 million.\nNote that a Tilt will forfeit your bonus and any POOL BALL MANIA points you\nhave, but you will not lose any extra balls you have earned.\n\nSpell WIZARD: Completing WIZARD lights the NO WAY target for 10 million\npoints a shot until the current ball drains. You add letters to WIZARD\nby hitting the NO WAY target while the red Spell Wizard light is lit behind\nthe Cue Ball. The bank shot will sometimes award letters as well.\nSpelling WIZARD also lights the 2 red special targets in the top of the\nmachine for 5M a hit.\n\nHorse Shoe points: The lights leading into either side of the horseshoe\nare 2 million, 5 million, 10 million, and 20 million. If any of these lights\nare flashing, hitting the ball into that side of the horseshoe will award\nthose points and advance to the next point value on the opposite side.\n\nSPECIAL targets: There are two red SPECIAL targets on the top left and\nright corners of the machine. The targets are lit by advancing your\nmultiplier to 7. You can tell these are lit by the white strobe that\nwill flash above either target. Only one will be lit at a time, and it\nswitches sides every time a bumper is hit.\n\nSTRATEGIES\nHit the bank shot A LOT. This will result in huge scores, and, if you get\nlucky, it will award a special or an extra ball.\n\nAn easy way to start 1/2 billion shot: Knock down the flashing drop targets\nbefore hitting the ramp to start Pool Ball Mania. This will light the\n8-ball that would normally be hit to light the ramp for multiball. Avoid\nhitting the 8-ball into the side pocket during Pool Ball Mania, and\nafter PBM ends, hit the ramp to start Nine Ball play. Now, instead of\nworrying about hitting the 1-7 drop targets, simply hit the 8-ball, and\nthe 9 drop target is lit for and easy 1/2 Billion!\n\nIt is said that two quick shots into the horseshoe during Horeshoe Extra\nball will award 2 extra balls. I have never gotten this to work. (Although\nI have done it MANY times.)\n\nHit the ramp while multiball is lit and the wagon wheel award is Rowdy Ramp.\nFirst, Rowdy Ramp will start, then, the multiball sequence will begin.\nPlunging the second ball will award 2 million automatically. After this,\nkeep both balls going through the ramp for huge Rowdy Ramp scores. (The\nramp maxes out at 40 million, but you can collect this multiple times.)\n\nA shot that hits the NO WAY target pretty consistently is as follows:\nThe ball will return to the left flipper after the ramp shot to start\nNO WAY. Let the ball get to the tip of the flipper, then flip. The\nball should hit off the right slingshot, and (hopefully) into the NO WAY\ntarget for 30 million.\n\nBe careful when hitting the Cue Ball into the Side Pocket. It's a drain shot.\nYou can avoid this problem by hitting the cue ball at an angle, kinda like\na real pool shot!\n\nStart the Side Pocket round and multiball at the same time. This way, you can\ncollect jackpots and the Side Pocket bonus at the same time.\n\nIf you have the ball trapped on the left flipper, you can backhand the\nball up into the 1-7 drop targets, and sometimes into the bank shot.\n\nDo NOT hit the ramp if Pool Ball Mania is lit and you are in 2 ball\nmultiball. It will not give you your third ball as it normally would.\n\nAfter winning your replay on points, try to get the multiplier up to 7\nto light the special targets in the back. (In some cases, this is the\nONLY way to get a replay once you have won several replays on points\nbecause of the HUGE replay boost this machine has.)\n\nSome Machine quotes\n\n \"Another coin, please.\" - After inserting your first quarter.\n \"Quit talkin' and start chalkin'\" - Pressing the start button\n \"Chalk up, partner.\" - If more than one person joins in the game.\n \"What kinda cow pie shot was that?\" - A failed ramp shot\n \"Hurry, get the extra ball!\" - When the hurry up extra ball is lit\n \"Extra ball's starin' ya right in the face.\" - Hurry up extra ball\n \"Yee-Ha, what a shot.\" - Hitting a jackpot, or a NO WAY shot\n \"YEEEEEEEE-HAAA!\" - Hitting a ramp during Rowdy Ramp\n \"Anyone seen my horse?\" - Hitting the Sweet Spot when it's not lit.\n \"Make my day.\" - Hitting the ball through the horseshoe for 5M.\n \"Just watch the Wiz, baby.\" Hitting the horseshoe for 10M.\n \"God, I'm good.\" - Hitting the horseshoe for 20M.\n \"One more for double!\" - When only one letter remains in DOUBLE.\n \"One more for wizard!\" - When only one letter remains in WIZARD.\n \"Thats what ya call the bank shot.\" - On some clean bank shots.\n \"Nice bank shot.\" - On some clean bank shots.\n \"Eight ball, side pocket.\" - Hitting the eight ball to light multiball.\n \"You found the King, baby.\" - Finding the King during video mode.\n \"You sure need that ramp shot.\" - When the ramp is lit.\n \"Go for the ramp!\" - When the ramp is lit.\n \"Get dat ramp!\" - When the ramp is lit.\n \"Hurry, get the nine ball!\" - When nine ball is lit for 500 million.\n \"It's nine ball time!\" - When you hit the ramp to start Nine ball play\n \"Surprise, Tenderfoot!\" - When you find Cactus Jack in Video Mode.\n \"I hate these outlanes.\" - Just guess when this happens.. :-]\n \"Looks like the game's over, partner.\" - When the game is over.\n \"You ain't thinkin' of leavin' now, are ya?\" - When the game is over.\n\n\nThere are more quotes..

This is the first production version. :-)  Thanks to\nall that helped.\n\nSpell checked it too .. What a concept :-)  (Using bug-filled software\nthat even had a suggestion for \"Quaaaaaaack\" =D )\n\nDid you actually *read* the disclaimer? :-)\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\n TJ Beyer\n Bill Ung\n Bowen Kerins\n Cameron Silver\n Jonathan Deitch\n Jim Hernandez\n Greg Creech (For loaning me his Cyclone machine on many occasions)\n Kevin Martin (For keeping the pinball archive running)\n Williams Electronics (For giving us \"A life\")\n\n\nGeneral Description\nIt's a big hunk of wood, and parts, with some lights here and there.\nOh, it has buttons on the side, and a spot to put your money in, and\neven a little silver ball that you can hit around with flippers.  Cool,\nHuh?  (Ok, So that wasn't the description you were looking for .. )\n\nCyclone was made by Williams in 1988.  It has 2 flippers, and no\nmultiball.  Despite it having no multiball, it is still a very fun\ngame, if it works right.  Starting from the lower playfield, kinda-\nsorta working up, here's the description.\n\n\n Flippers  There are 2 of them, \"Normal\" size, located just above\nthe outhole.  There is a small post (T2/Pinbot size) in between the\nflippers.\n\n Return lanes  They are normal size, for games of that time period.\nThe right return lane lights the Ferris Wheel.  Either return\nlane will re-light the \"Advance X\" light on the boomerang hole.\n\n Outlanes  Pretty fair.  There are posts on the inside of them, to\nkeep balls from rolling up the inlane, and out the outlane.  Both\noutlanes have \"Extra Ball\" lights on them, which are toggled (Left/\nRight) by the flippers, slingshots, jet bumpers .. etc.\n\n Duck targets  Just above the right outlane, 3 stand-up targets,\nthat re-light the Cyclone ramp.  First completion will score 25k,\nSecond 50k, and the third completion lights Extra Ball on the outlanes.\nCompleting these also lights \"Bonus\" of \"Hold Bonus\"\n\n Boomerang kickout  Small kickout, from under the playfield, kicks\nthe ball generally towards the left flipper, but I have seen it go to\nthe right flipper, and even gasp SDTM.  You can hit the ball in\nhere, when the \"Adv. X\" light is on.  This will advance your bonus\nmultiplier.  More on that later.\n\n Comet ramp  Smack dab in the middle of the playfield (Ok, Just a\ntad to the left) is a ramp.  This is the Comet ramp, it returns the\nball to the right return lane.  More on it's scoring later.  You can\nre-light it by hitting the stand-up targets to the left of it.  If\nyou don't hit the ball hard enough, to make it all the way around, it\nwill fall into the jet bumpers, through a second hole.  It's a whole\nlot better than having the ball come speeding down towards the\nflippers, isn't it? :-)\n\n Spook-House  Just to the right of the Comet ramp, there is a small\nsinkhole behind a single drop target.  Kickout is from the boomerang\nhole.  Hitting the ball in here spins the Mystery Wheel .. More on\nthat later.\n\n Cat Targets  Just to the left of the Comet ramp.  These re-light\nthe comet.  You can spot one of them, via the target that is to the\nright of the spook house (Kinda hidden).  These award 20k, and light\n\"Hold\" of \"Hold Bonus\".\n\n Cyclone ramp  To the right of the Spook-House, and back a little\nmore on the playfield.  Shooting this ramp 3 times when lit scores\nthe jackpot .. More on that later.  This ramp returns the ball to\nthe right return lane.\n\n Jet Bumpers  3 of them, Just below the top rollover lanes.\n\n Ferris Wheel  A cute \"toy\" that is in the back left corner of the\nmachine.  This scores the \"Ferris Bonus\" when lit (Via the right\nreturn lane).  The Ferris Wheel returns the ball to the left return\nlane.  If you get a chance, look at the different expressions on the\npeople's faces. :-)\n\n 1-2-3 rollovers  3 lanes at the top, when completed, start the\ndouble scoring feature, which lasts for x seconds.  Double score\ndoubles all the point values on the playfield, including the million\nshot on the Comet ramp.  It does not however double the jackpot,\nshould you get it during \"Double Score\".  As with most games, you can\nchange the position of the top lanes with the left, or right flipper.\n(x is operator adjustable, from 0 (off) to 99 seconds.  Factory = 20)\n\n Skill shot  There is a skill-shot, that I didn't really know how to put it in\nup there.  It requires a soft shot, and you want to get the ball in\nthe middle of the 5 holes.  The middle of the 5 holes is worth 100k.\nThere is a multiplier on the skill shot, which is the value that you\nget, multiplied by what ball this is (Maxes out at 5 X).  (Note: It\nwill increment the multiplier for extra balls, so it is possible to\nhave a 4 X skill shot on ball 3, for example).\n\nSkill shot values are (From bottom to top) 10k, 25k, 100k, 25k, and 5k.\n\n Other  There are several switches behind rubbers, that score points, and make\nsounds.  The points aren't very much, but they're points. :-) \n\n Mystery Wheel  This is on the backglass, and has values ranging from\n\"Zilch\" to 200k, Extra Ball, and Special.  More on this later.\n\n Backglass  Superb artwork.  There is a roller coaster (The Cyclone)\nwith Ronald, and Nancy Reagan in the front seat.  [Former USA president,\nand his wife].\n\n Sound  This game had very good, cool sound effects, for it's time.\nYou may notice that they used the sound from when you get \"Double\nScore\"; in Fun House, it is used as the \"Shoot Again\" when Rudy is\nasleep.  They also used one of the (many) whistles; in WhiteWater, it\nis the No Way Out kickout warning sound.  There are many cool \"Bells\nand whistles\", as well as amusing buzzers.  The game has a lot of good\nspeech too.  The attract mode is very well synchronized, in terms\nof sound, and lights.\n\n Displays  Cyclone was back in the time of alpha-numeric displays.\nThe highest score that the high score table will hold is 9,999,999.\n\n\nCyclone has many options that can be adjusted by the operator,\nincluding the length of certain timers.  With that in mind, the\nsettings on the machine you choose to play may vary, and just for\nthat reason, I didn't put alot of the timer values in here.  Most\nof the features time out in 15 seconds.\n\nGame play\nStart out with the skill shot, which shoots the ball into the area\nabove the rollover lanes.  From there, the ball goes into the jet\nbumpers, and can come out either side.  The jet bumpers increase the\nFerris Bonus, which is collected on the Ferris Wheel (when lit).\n\nThere is no multiball on this game, but once you get to playing it,\nyou probably won't notice that there isn't multiball.  The game doesn't\nreally need it, otherwise, it would be a little on the easy side.\n\nJackpot\n\nShooting the right ramp 3 times before the timer expires will award\nthe current jackpot, which is displayed in lights, to the left of the\nmystery wheel on the backglass.  After you get the jackpot, it resets to\n500k.  After you run out of credits, it will add 1 million to the jackpot,\nif you got it.\n\nAfter you score a jackpot, the \"Millions\" digit in your score will flash,\nunless of course, your score is under a million, in which case, it will\nbegin flashing when there is a digit there .. :-)  I believe this is also\ntrue if you get the \"Million\" shot on the Comet ramp.\n\nThe jackpot increases 5k for each time you hit one of the 1-2-3 rollover\nswitches at the top of the playfield.\n\nAfter you get the jackpot, (or get it lit, and let the timer run out)\nyou will need to re-light the Cyclone ramp.  Hit the 3 duck targets,\njust above the right outlane.  There is no maximum on the number of\njackpots you can get per game, however, it resets back to 500k after\nyou get the jackpot.\n\nComet Million\n\nOn the back panel of the playfield, just behind the Ferris Wheel, there\nis a set of lights, which indicates the value of the next shot on the\nComet ramp.  Each shot increases this, one step at a time, towards the\nmillion shot.  Note: You can get the million shot during double score,\nand it will award 2 million, as well as different sound effects. :-)\n\nYou can get as many \"Millions\" as you want, as long as you keep\nre-lighting the Comet, and building it up.  It's kinda more work\nthan it's worth, unless you like shooting the same shot over and\nover again. :-)\n\nValues go up in 20k increments, lowest being 20k, and the highest\nbeing 100k.  Starting values will vary, depending on settings.  After\nyou get the 100k shot, the million shot is lit, on the Comet ramp.\nIt will probably start you out with the 40k lit, and the 60k flashing.\n\nAfter you get up to a certain point on the Comet ramp, and the timer\nexpires before you can get another shot at it, then you will have to\nre-light the Comet ramp.  To do this, you need to complete the 3\nstand-up targets to the left of the Comet ramp.  There is also a small\ntarget on the right side of the Spook-House island that will spot one\nof these targets for you.\n\nFerris Wheel\n\nThe right return lane lights the Ferris Wheel.  When you shoot the lit\nFerris Wheel, you collect the current value, usually anywhere from\n100k to 250k or so.  Ball is returned to the left return lane.\nFerris Bonus = 50K + 3K per bumper.\n\nSpook-House\n\nTo gain access to the Spook-House, you need to knock down the drop\ntarget in front of the sinkhole.  Hitting the ball in the sinkhole\nbehind the target will spin the mystery wheel on the backglass.  Quite\nan interesting toy, as the machine knows *Exactly* what position the\nwheel is in at all times, if it works right.  Same concept that is used\nto work the clock in Diner, but that's a different game :-).\n\nThe worst award you can get is \"Zilch\", which awards 0 points.\nThe lowest point value you can get off the wheel is 5,000 (5k)\nThe highest point value you can get off the wheel is 200,000 (200k)\nThere are also \"Extra Ball\" and \"Special\" awards on the wheel.\nThe drop target is on a timer, may be short, may be long. (adjustable)\nThe kickout is from the boomerang hole, Just above the left slingshot.\n\nSpecial/Bonus X\n\nTo advance your Bonus X, shoot the boomerang hole.  This is where\nthe ball gets kicked out from the Spook-House.  It will only advance\nyour Bonus X when it's lit, and you can re-light it by the return\nlanes.  Or, even simpler, shoot a ramp, or the Ferris Wheel. :-)\n\nSpecial -- You can get a special by getting your Bonus X up to the\nflashing light, on the Bonus X light wheel, just above the flippers.\nI've seen the flashing light as low as 3, and as high as 7.  It's\nusually a good indication of how polite the boomerang kickout is.\n\nGame Quotes\n\n \"Hurry, Hurry, Step right up\" -- Game start\n \"We have a winner!!\" -- When you get the 100k on the skill shot,\nWhen you get a good score on the mystery wheel, When you get\na match at the end of the game.\n \"Round and round she goes\" -- Mystery wheel spinning\n \"Ya paid your money, Ya take your chances.\" -- Zilch on Mystery Wheel.\n \"Won't you come in\" -- When you knock down the Spook-House target.\n \"Welcome to my house\" -- Same as above.  Alternates between the 2\n \"Ride the Comet\" -- When you light/re-light the Comet\n \"Ride the Cyclone\" -- When you light/re-light the Cyclone\n \"Ride the Ferris Wheel\" -- When you light/re-light the Ferris Wheel\n \"Hey You! With the face\" -- During gameplay/attract mode.\n \"Hey You! Step right up\" -- Same as above\n \"Hey You!\" -- Same as above (Do we see a trend here? :-))\n \"Quaaaaaaack\" -- Close to a cow .. :-) -- Duck targets/Match\n \"Million\" -- When the million is lit\n Lots of whistles, and buzzes.\n There's probably more speech too.\n\n\nThe game makes alot of noise in Attract Mode, which is cool.  It can\nbe scarry in a quiet house, while watching TV, and the machine yells\n\"Hey You!\" .. Needless to say, I turned it off for the night. :-)\n\nEaster Eggs\nThere aren't any cows in this game .. Sorry guys.\nUse your imagination. :-)\n\nThere are however, other animals, in the artwork, just above the\nflippers.  How many can you name? :-)\n\n-TJ\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Cyclone", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/cyclone.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Cyclone", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

It is a *five* ball game, and has lots of stuff\non the playfield.  It has as many gizmos as Judge Dredd but has a much better\ndesign.  In many ways, it's what Judge Dredd could have and should have been.\n\nThe most distinguishing features are two handles mounted about six inches\nforward of the flipper buttons on the sides of the case sticking out above\nthe surface of the topglass.  The handles each have a trigger button which\nacts as a flipper button, and a thumb button on top used by some modes.\n\nThere is not, so far as we know, a video mode, a special award, or any major\nmajor bugs .... so far.\n\nPlayfield Description and Layout\nFlippers: There are two standard-length flippers at the bottom, and one upper\nleft flipper at the bottom of the left loop.  There isn't much space\nbetween the two bottom flippers, thankfully.\nSlingshots: The left slingshot is standard,  but with a slight angle at the\ntop to make the left inlane larger at the top.  The right slingshot is\nshaped like ST:TNG slings at the top, but much narrower.  It's more like\na standard slingshot with a flattened top.\nLeft Inlane: When lit, this inlane lights the Access Claw on the right ramp.\nRetina Scan: This is the leftmost shot of the game.  The ball passes through a\ngate and into an eject that feeds the left inlane.  If hit hard enough\nthrough the gate, it will hit the captive eyeball.\nCar Crash: Located to the left of the retina scan is the Car Crash target.\nTriggering the switch causes two miniature cars to crash.   This is\nsupposedly a \"new feature.\"  The ball will rocket off this target, but\nthere's a ballsaver if it goes STDM.\nLeft Loop: This loop is just to the right of the upper flipper.  It feeds to a\nsinkhole when hit hard enough; otherwise, the ball passes behind the top\nramp into the MTL rollovers.  This shot can be lit to start multiball and\naward extra balls, otherwise it awards a mystery bonus.\nLights are, from bottom up, Extra Ball, Start Multi-Ball, Explode,\nJackpot, Combo arrow.\nLeft Ramp: Directly to the right of the left loop is this ramp which always\nfeeds to the left inlane.  It can be lit for \"Quick Freeze\" and the\n\"Car Chase\" round.\nLights are, from bottom up, Quick Freeze, Car Chase, Explode, Jackpot,\nCombo arrow.\nUpper Rebound : This is a three inch piece of rubber forming the left wall of\nthe Center Ramp that is stretched across a switch ... hitting the rubber\nactivates the switch, just like the left and right 110 switches on\nWhirlwind.\nCenter Ramp (the ACMag): Located at the very top of the playfield, it is a\nwide ramp (three pinball widths wide) that is triggered only by a gate.\nBalls drop immediately and roll either down the left loop or into the\nMTL rollovers.  The center ramp has a Jackpot lamp and a Combo arrow.\nThe Center Ramp is bounded on the left by the Upper Rebound and on the\nright by the left jet bumper.\nTop Sinkhole: This shot awards a mystery bonus when nothing is lit; it awards\nmultiball and extra balls when lit.  This shot is most easily made from\na left loop shot; occasionally, however, a ball will bounce in there from\na lucky center ramp shot.\nMTL rollovers: In the top right corner are three rollovers which advance the\nbonus multiplier.  Balls leave the rollovers into the jet bumpers.  These\nare very hard to see from the player's point of view.  Especially the\nleftmost (M) rollover. \nJet Bumpers: There are two regular jet bumpers and a top slingshot which\nscores the same as a jet bumper.  They advance the Retina Scan value.\nThe left jet bumper can also be hit from the center ramp -- it acts as\nthe right wall of the center ramp.\nUnderground: This is a sinkhole to the left of the jets and to the right of\nthe center ramp, with the opening on the left side.  It is an easy shot\nfrom the upper left flipper, and it can also be made with a little luck\nfrom either of the lower flippers.  The Computer and Demolition Time are\nawarded here. The Underground has a Jackpot lamp and a Combo arrow.\nThe ball is returned, via a VUK to the right ramp habitrail.  The\nComputer and Demolition time are indicated by yellow and blue lights\nmounted over the Underground entrance.\nSide Ramp: This is a small, twisting, and difficult ramp just below the\nComputer.  It is used for the skill shot.  The Side Ramp has a jackpot\nlamp and a Combo Arrow.\nRight Ramp: This is a tall ramp similar to the right ramp in Judge Dredd.\nIt has a diverter which normally sends the ball to the right inlane, but\nit can send the ball to the Cryo-Claw when that feature is available.\nIt's also used during the Car Chase round, and to score Super Jackpots.\nLights are, from bottom up, Claw Ready, Car Chase, Explode, Jackpot,\nCombo Arrow.  There is a Super Jackpot light mounted over the ramp.\nRight Loop: This shot feeds the ball past the MTL rollovers and all the way\naround to the upper left flipper.  If it doesn't make it (ie: weak shot)\nthe ball will fall into the MTL rollovers.\nLights are, from bottom up, Explode, Jackpot, Combo Arrow.\nRight Inlane: When lit, this inlane lights the left ramp for a \"Quick Freeze.\"\nRight Rebound : This is a three inch piece of rubber on the right  side of the\nplayfield, just above the right outlane.  Just like the Upper Rebound, it\nis rubber stretched across a switch.\nOutlanes: There are posts on the inlane/outlane dividers, but they are very\ndangerous due to the crazy spins the ball tends to have.  DM is shipped\nwithout rubber on these posts.  There are no \"Specials\" or other awards\nin the outlanes.\nStandups:  There are 5 yellow standup targets scattered about the playfield,\nlike those in TZ.  However, these targets are very important to game\nplay.  One is located directly below the upper left flipper; another is\nto the right of the left ramp; two more are angled to the left of the\nright ramp; and one is to the right of the right ramp.\nCryo-Claw:  This is the game's big gimmick.  An \"elevator\" carries balls from\nthe right ramp up to a magnetic claw which the player controls with the\ntwo gun triggers.  The claw can be positioned and the ball dropped into\none of 5 lanes, each starting a different \"mode\" (I use that term\nloosely).  Depending on the mode chosen, the ball will return to a\ndifferent position.\nThere are four Multiball status lights stacked on top of each other dead\ncenter above the flippers and a set of four \"Freeze\" lights for locked\nballs in a gentle arc left to right across the lower middle playfield.\nThe Ball-Saver is indicated by a pair of small red inlays just above\neach flipper.\nLastly, each flipper has an anti-biff bar under it ... like it's possible to\nbang a ball back into play on a wide-body game with the new drain setup ...\nSkill Shot\nThe Skill Shot is made by hitting the launched ball (assuming it makes\nit all the way around to the upper left flipper) up the side ramp from the\nupper left flipper.  This is in actuality the first lit Combo shot and as\nsuch is worth 5million.  The second made skill shot is worth 10mil, etc.\nMade skill shots increase the value of subsequent combo shots.\nCombos\nCombos are the most important part of Demolition Man ...\nA combo is any sequence of the seven major shots when lit by its flashing\nred arrow.  In a really neat feature, unlit shots lite the next shots in\nsequence ... in other words, you can keep hitting shots one after the\nother and the game will keep lighting the proper shots in sequence.\nAny major shot will light whatever shots can easily be made from that\nshot.  Ie: Left inlane lights right ramp, right loop, AcMag ramp ... Right\ninlane lights Left orbit, Left ramp ... Right orbit (or AcMag/left roll)\nlights Computer and Side Ramp, etc.\nThis is *not* as easy as it sounds ...\nEach combo awards a set value depending on how many shots you have hit\nin sequence ... 5M for the first, then 6M, 7M, etc. with no apparent\nlimit.  The scoring reverts to 5M when the lit flashing shots time out.\nYou can make other shots in the meantime and the combos will remain lit.\nThe skill shot increases the base combo value by 1 million.\nThe side ramp will score \"Double Combo\" as the second part of a right loop/\nside ramp combo.\nFour of the combo shots (left and right loop, left and right ramp) also\nhave \"explode\" lites which award 10million a shot.  Explodes are lit by\nhitting an *unlit* underground hole (i.e. not lit as a combo; it may be\nlit for Computer or Demolition Time).   The Retina Scan also starts a\n\"Explode Hurry Up\" round which makes use of these lights.  See Retina\nScan for details.\nThe Combo shots lite the Computer every 10 combos and an extra ball at\n12 and 50 combos.  The 12 combo extra ball is percentage adjustable.  The\nComputer @ 10 combos is operator adjustable to 6,8,10,12 combos.  Defaults\nare 10 combos/computer and 12 combos/extra ball.\nComputer\nThe Computer is accessed via the UnderGround shot and is lit by a yellow\nlamp immediately above.  Lit every 10 combos, the Computer is a random\naward like the Camera on Twilight Zone.  Awards seen so far :\n\nLight Extra Ball\nLight Explodes (lights all four explode 10M lamps)\n3x Car Crash\n2x Retina Scan\nLight Arrows   (lights Laser millions on all combo shots)\nMaximize Freezes (freezes four balls and lights multiball)\nCollect Bonus (complete with bonus music!)\nCollect Standups (awards all the lit yellow targets)\n\nRetina Scan\nThis is the eyeball shot on the left side of the playfield.  Shots that\nknock the captive eyeball into the upper target award the Retina Scan value.\nAt certain numbers of Retina Scans hits, Explode Hurry Up is activated.\nIt takes 1 hit for the first Hurry-Up, four for the next.  All four\nExplode ramps are lit at a value of 15M that begins counting down.  Hit\nany explode lamp to collect and add 10M to the value for the next Explode\nshot.  The round times out when the countdown reaches 5M (or higher if\nyou've collected a few of the shots).\nAn extra ball is lit at three Retina Scans.\nRetina Scan shots feed to the left saucer which drops the ball into the\nleft inlane.\nCar Crash\nPlaced immediately above the Retina Scan, the Car Crash contains two captive\ncars (yes, that's right ... captive cars) behind an impact target.  Hitting\nthe target adds to the Car Crash value and lights an additional Car Crash\nlight.  Hitting the target with three lights lit award the Car Crash value.\n\nCar Crash is worth three, then six, then ten million (for 1/2/3 hits) and\nis doubled if the top car hits the target at the end of the captive lane.\nCar Crash lights Car Chase on the left/right lamps.\nThe Car Crash target has a terrible habit of deflecting the ball straight\ndown the middle, but the software does compensate with a short duration\nball saver.  (Which, I'll warn you, can be turned off in LA-4 ROMs)\nIt's also quite easy to shake the cars across their opto switches if your\ntilt is liberal enough.\nTop Lock\nThe top lock is accessible via the left loop and a lucky center ramp shot.\nIt awards multiball and extra balls when lit and a mystery value when unlit.\nMystery values include :\n\nBig Points: 1M\nHold/advance bonus X\nHold standup value\nBoost combo values\nHold combo values\nLight Access Claw\nLight Quick Freeze\nIncrease Retina Value (+2 mil)\n\nA left loop/top lock combination shot awards two combos and, in Capture\nSimon mode, two Simon awards.\nMTL Rollovers\nMTL Rollovers light an increasing bonus (2x, 3x, 4x, 5x) multiplier.  They\nare *very* hard to see because of the two big ramps in the way.\nGetting the 5x bonus multiplier lights the extra ball on the left loop.\nEach completed MTL rollover sequence lights Access Claw.\nJet Bumpers\nThe Jet Bumpers increase the Retina Value.  It starts at 5M and goes up\n100K per jet.  There are two Jet Bumpers and one slingshot ... the slingshot\ncounts as a jet bumper.\nJet Bumpers award 500k a Pop.\nThe Claw\nThe Claw is the other major important feature of Demolition Man.  It\nawards five different modes culminating with a 'wizard award' of Demolition\nTime.  The Claw is accessed via the right ramp when lit.  Completing the\nMTL rollovers lights the left inlane which then lights the claw on the\nright ramp.  The five claw award (from left to right) are :\nStart AcMag -- this mode returns the ball to the left inlane.  Repeated\ncenter ramp shots award an increasing value just like Judge Dredd's\nexcellent Safe Cracker mode.  Animation is an increasingly bizarre range\nof objects being blown to kingdom come.\nAwards are 5mil to 12.5mil, then 6mil to 13.5mil, adding 1million for\neach successful center ramp shot.\nLock Freeze -- This is a simple award, not really a mode.  Lock freeze locks\nas many flashing Freeze lamps as you need to light multiball, or starts\na multiball if lit.  When you Lock Freeze to start a multiball, it starts\nthe multiball with one *additional* frozen ball.  VERY HANDY.\nThe ball is returned to the saucer above the left inlane.\nPrison Break -- This is an award/shoot mode that's very quick.  The ball is\ndropped above the upper left flipper.  You are awarded 15million.  A\nreflex shot into the Underground doubles this, a reflex shot into the\nside ramp triples this.\nPrison Break also lights Car Chase which is an alternating ramp award\nvery similar to PayBack Time on T2.  Awards are 5 million per\nsuccessful ramp.\nSuper Jets -- The Jet Bumpers are lit for 25 hits at 1million per hit.  Each\nyellow target adds to the number of hits left.\nThe Ball is dropped directly into the jet bumper area.\nCapture Simon -- The ball is dropped down a tunnel and served to the right\nramp just like the Underground.  The seven major shots are lit for 5mil\neach for three shots.  Each 5million award is added to a 25million award\nfor completing all three shots for a total of 40million.\nAll Claw mode awards increase the second time around.\nDemolition Time\nThis is the award for completing all five Claw Modes.  It is accessed via\nthe Underground which is lit via a blue light.  All major shots are lit\nfor 15million and stay lit.  That's right -- all shots remain lit for as\nlong as you keep more than one ball in play.  Completing the five yellow\ntargets adds a ball and increases the jackpot award by 5mil.  Losing a ball\ndecreases the award.  All shots are totaled for a \"Demolition Time Total\"\nlike LITZ is and is a separate high score table entry.\nDemolition time starts with an outright 50million point award.  \nAnd some very, very neat sounds/animation ...\nThe Yellow Targets\nThese are similar to Twilight Zone's Greed targets.  They are worth 1million\nplus 1million per number of hits (resets on each ball).  Maximum of 20 hits.\nDepending on machine settings, One, Two, or Three sets of targets must be\ncompleted to light Quick Freeze, depending on whether Quick Freeze is set\nto easy, medium, or hard.\nMultiballs\nDemolition Man has *four* multiball modes ... each of which has a variable\nnumber of balls.  Ball locks are lit by lighting Freeze lamps via the\nyellow targets ... Balls are then locked via the left ramp or Claw.\nMultiball is started by hitting the top lock via the left loop or, sometimes,\na lucky shot up the center ramp.  Multiball can also be started, if all\nrequired balls are already frozen, via the Lock Freeze mode on the Claw.\nFortress Multiball -- Requires one frozen ball.  Jackpots are Center Ramp,\nUnderGround, Left Ramp.  Then the Right Ramp is lit for a Super Jackpot.\nFirst three are normal jackpots, Super Jackpot is a Triple Jackpot.\nBase is 20mil to 35mil based on number of frozen balls and the yellow\ntargets add 2mil to the base value.  After getting the Super Jackpot,\nthe center ramp relights to start over again.  During the second go-round,\nmore shots are required before the Super Jackpot is lit ... mainly, the\nleft and right loops are added as Jackpot shots.\nMuseum Multiball -- Requires two frozen balls.  All shots are lit for\njackpots.  Once all jackpots are made, the right ramp is lit for the\nSuper Jackpot.  Base value is 25M (minimum since you froze two balls),\njet bumpers add 1million.\nWasteland Multiball -- Appears to function exactly like Fortress with\nlarger jackpots (because of more freezes) and more than one jackpot can\nbe lit at a time.\nCryo-Prison Multiball -- All Jackpot shots are lit and ADD to the Super\nJackpot which is lit for repeated shots to the right ramp.  The regular\nJackpot shots do not award Jackpots, though ... they *just* add to the\nSuper Jackpot.  Note that after shooting a Super, you have to shoot a\nregular Jackpot shot to relight it ... and you can't collect another\nSuper Jackpot until the animation from the current one finishes.\nInteresting note -- Super Jackpot shots go to the Claw where they are\nreturned to the left inlane. \n\nCompleting all Multiballs light a special Demolition Jackpot shot on the\nright ramp.  The game takes the best Jackpot score for each multiball\nmode (regular jackpot or super jackpot) and multiplies it by the total\nnumber of jackpots in each multiball mode according to the following\nformula (thanks Keefer !) :\n\n\nFor the purposes of the DJ, all super jackpots count as jackpots.  Then,\nall the jackpots are added up like this :\n(# Fortress jackpots + 1) * 15M +\n(# Museum jackpots + 1) * 20M +\n(# Wasteland jackpots + 1) * 25M +\n(# Cryoprison jackpots + 1) * 30M = Demolition Jackpot\nTherefore, the minimum DJ you can get is 90M, if you didn't get a single\njackpot.  Also, if you start another multiball (Fortress) when the DJ is\nlit, it goes away (just like draining)!\nAfter you complete Cryo-Prison multiball, and hopefully collect the\nDemolition Jackpot, you start over with Fortress Multiball.\nBonus\nBonus count consists of 10mil for each claw visit, 1mil for each combo,\nand a bonus multiplier.  Bonus can be speeded up by pressing both flippers.\nNote: you can repeat claw modes and each claw visit, NOT each lit claw\naward, scores 10M in bonus.  There is a special trigger award ... see the\nspoilers for more details.\nGame Notes \nAs I've noted in many posts, this game has *weird* physics.  I've seen balls\nclear the entire playfield in the air ... roll in circles ... hit a wall\nand bounce 20 inches to clear a metal wall ... and worse.  There is lots\nof rubber, lots of spin, and we all know what that ends up with.\nAnimation is superb, and the L-1 sound ROMs are an exceptional improvement\nover the old P-1 ROMs.  This game has the best sound other than Star Trek TNG\nI've heard ... for music alone, I think its actually better than STTNG.\nBall play is fluid, albeit frenetic when the ball goes on one of its physics\nbending tricks.  Shots lead fluidly from one to another.\nThere doesn't seem to be a big scoring flaw in the game and scores seem\nto be stabilized in the 1 to 5 billion range.  While this is still high,\nit's considerably better that STTNG's absurdly high scoring.\nCows and Secret Awards\nThere are a few secret awards from the triggers ...\nAll combos made by using the triggers as flipper buttons award an\nadditional 1 million at fun with bonus.\n\n\nPressing both thumb buttons on the handles during a multiball awards\nthe next Jackpot as a \"Secret Jackpot\" (not including super jackpots).\n\nPressing both thumb buttons when you get \"Big Points/1million\" from\nthe top lock yields an \"Eat at Joe's\" graphic and 5 million points.\n\nPressing both thumb buttons *and* both triggers when you get \"Big\npoints/1million\" from the top lock yields \"WAG\" for 10 million points.\n\nPressing both thumb buttons right after the third Capture Simon shot\n(when you've captured him) yields a 10 million capture bonus.\n\nPressing both thumb buttons after the ball drains down the outlanes,\nduring the Capture Simon mode, will Capture Simon (but not award a capture bonus).\n\nPressing both thumb buttons right after hitting the second Retina\nScan yields a great graphic of the prison warden getting his eye poked\nout and used for the retina scan ... plus 10 million.  This is called\nthe \"Smithers\" bonus after the character in the movie.\n\nPressing both thumb buttons right after getting the U-Look-Gr8-2Day\ngives you a 10 million \"Feel Great\" bonus ...\n\n\nThere are also three cows so far :\n\n\nThe eighth AcMag award is an exploding cow.\n\nThere is also a secret cow in the AcMag mode ... just press both thumb\nbuttons at any point to get a free AcMag award and the same exploding\ncow from above.\n\nThere is a cow on the rotating icon panel for the top lock's mystery\naward.\n\nRolling the ball up the left inlane and into the Retina Scan saucer will\ngive you 10 million and a \"Huxley\" bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Demolition Man", "possible_shots": "Flippers, Slingshots, Left Inlane, Retina Scan, Car Crash, Left Loop, Left Ramp, Upper Rebound, Center Ramp (the ACMag), Top Sinkhole, MTL rollovers, Jet Bumpers, Underground, Side Ramp, Right Ramp, Right Loop, Right Inlane, Right Rebound, Outlanes, Standups, Cryo-Claw", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/demolitionman.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Demolition Man", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

A HTML version plus\n      other goodies can be found at\n      http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Jetty/8726/\n\n\n      Gottlieb released Devil's Dare in August 1982 as the first in their\n      System 80A Series, and introducing enhanced U2 and U3 ROM memory chips\n      offering improved bookkeeping and self-test capabilities, new 7-digit\n      displays, and more coin/credit combinations. The System 80A U2 and U3\n      ROMs were now socketed on the CPU board, making for easy exchanges.\n      Gottlieb however did nothing to rectify the inherent design faults of the\n      earlier System 80 power supply and driver boards for the System 80A\n      games.\n\n      Devil's Dare was designed by Tom Sczfransky (his only pinball according\n      to the IPD), and features the devilish artwork of Doug Watson (he of BK,\n      BK2K, T2, IJ, F-14 fame) and David Moore, in their only pin\n      collaboration. The playfield features 3 pop bumpers, 2 banks of 4 and 2\n      banks of 2 spot targets, 2 banks of 5 and 1 bank of 3 drop-targets, 2\n      spinning targets, 1 roll-under, 6 kicking rubbers, ball-saver in left\n      outlane, Captive \"Pit\" and \"Cave\", 3 flippers (third is at the top of the\n      playfield). The gameplay features 2 and 3 ball multi-ball, and\n      \"Multi-mode\" - an extra round of multi-ball awarded for scoring 50'000 or\n      70'000 points during 2 or 3-ball multi-ball.\n\n      Devil's Dare had the sound/speech board fitted, however it seems that\n      like Black Hole, many games (particularly exported games) had the sound\n      only board. The sound only version unfortunately makes cheesy and quite\n      annoying sounds like a \"slot-machine\", whilst the devilish commands given\n      by a talker are:\n\n        *BALL SAVE - when Ball Save is initiated.\n\n        *SHOOT SPOT TARGETS - at random after 3 targets of either bank have\n         been lit.\n\n        *YOU\"RE CLOSE - at random after 40'000 or 60'000 points have been\n         scored on the multi-mode bonus display.\n\n        *MULTI-MODE ACHIEVED - after Multi-mode has been earned.\n\n        *SHOOT CAPTIVE CAVE - at random after its lamp is lip or after the\n         outside return has been activated.\n\n        *SHOOT CAPTIVE PIT - at random after its lamp is lit.\n\n        *FIRE - when a ball is released to the shooter.\n\n      Gottlieb produced 3'832 Devil's Dare pins but, due to the high percentage\n      that were exported, it is considered to be something of a rarity in the\n      USA.\n        ____________________________________________________________________\n\n\n   The Devil Rules!\n  ------------------\n\n      GAME OBJECTIVES: Ah yes, that's a good question and I haven't yet had\n      much chance to work out the answer yet! Anyway hitting the drop and spot\n      targets all over the playfield seems to be fairly crucial, followed by\n      loading balls into the \"Captive Pit\" and \"Captive Cave\" for multi-ball.\n      Naturally when you get round to it, keeping multi-ball going for as long\n      as possible and hitting spot and drop targets are a good idea!\n\n      Top Red Spot Targets (4)\n        Location: upper left of playfield, adjacent to \"Captive Pit\" exit gate\n        Scoring: 500 when unlit or flashing, 2000 when lit\n        Extra: completing the sequence twice light the red Special lamp in the\n         right outlane, and enables Ball Save\n\n      Red Drop Targets (3)\n        Location: upper right of playfield, in path of ball exiting shooter\n         lane (\"skill-shot\")\n        Scoring: 2000 when lit or 300 when unlit\n        Extra: completing the bank enables the Ball Save, and lights the inside\n         return lanes\n\n      Yellow Spot Targets (2)\n        Location: Top right corner of playfield above upper flipper\n        Scoring: info to follow\n        Extra: info to follow\n\n      Right Red Spot Targets (4)\n        Location: right centre of playfield\n        Scoring: 500 when unlit or flashing, 2000 when lit\n        Extra: completing the sequence once (3-ball) or twice (5-ball) enables\n         Ball Save\n\n      Central Drop Targets (5)\n        Location: centre of playfield facing flippers\n        Scoring: 2000 when lit or 300 when unlit\n        Extra: completing the bank enables the Ball Save, and enables \"Capture\n         Cave\"\n\n      Left Drop Targets (5)\n        Location: left centre of playfield\n        Scoring: 2000 when lit or 300 when unlit\n        Extra: completing the bank enables the Ball Save, and enables \"Capture\n         Pit\" after a ball has been captured in \"Captive Cave\"\n\n      Left Yellow Spot Targets (2)\n        Location: left of playfield above out and return lanes\n        Scoring: 2000\n        Extra: upper lights right return lanes and lower lights left return\n         lanes\n\n      Pop-bumpers (3)\n        Location: triangular setting in upper centre of playfield\n        Scoring: 300 when unlit and 3000 when lit (3-ball), or 100 when unlit\n         and 1000 when lit (5-ball)\n\n      Left Spinning Target\n        Location: at entrance to \"Captive Pit\", above left bank of drop targets\n        Scoring: 300 when unlit, 2000 when lit\n        Extra: adds bonus\n\n      Right Spinning Target\n        Location: right of playfield, below exit from plunger lane\n        Scoring: 300 when unlit, 2000 when lit\n        Extra: adds bonus\n\n      Captive Cave\n        Location: Left side of playfield, behind left drop target bank\n        Scoring: 5000\n        Extra: Capture enabled when lit\n\n      Captive Pit\n        Location: Left side of playfield, entrance via left spinning target\n        Scoring: 5000\n        Extra: Capture enabled when lit\n\n      Inside Return Lanes (2)\n        Location: left and right at bottom of playfield, leading to flippers\n        Scoring: 500 when unlit, 3000 when lit\n        Extra: when lit, right lane lights left spinner for one shot and left\n         lane lights right spinner for one shot\n\n      Outside Return Lanes (2)\n        Location: left and right at bottom of playfield, leading to flippers\n        Scoring: 500 when unlit, 3000 when lit\n        Extra: when lit, left lane lights rollunder for one shot and right lane\n         lights Capture Ball for one shot - the ball landing in \"Capture Cave\"\n         is captured for multi-ball play\n\n      Ten Point Switch\n        Location: island to right of lower right pop bumper\n        Scoring: 10 points per hit\n\n      Kicking Rubbers (4)\n        Location: right of playfield beneath bank of 4 red spot targets and\n      above right out and return lanes; slingshots left and right of bottom of\n      playfield above flippers; top left of playfield to left of left pop\n      bumper.\n        Scoring: 30 points per hit\n\n      BONUS\n      Regular bonus accumulated during play is shown on the bonus display. When\n      the ball drains, the player receives the bonus x multiplier.\n\n      SPECIAL\n      Completing the top 4 red spot targets twice lights the red Special lamp\n      in the right outlane.\n\n      EXTRA BALL\n      Completing the 4 red spot targets, right centre of the playfield, once\n      (3-ball play) or twice (5-ball play) lights the pink Extra Ball lamp in\n      the entrance to the central island, and making the rollunder gate at its\n      exit awards the Extra Ball\n\n      BALL SAVE\n      Ball Save is enabled by:\n        -completing the top spot target sequence twice\n        -completing any drop target bank\n        -completing the 4 red spot targets, right center of the playfield,\n          once (3-ball play) or twice (5-ball play)\n\n      MULTI-BALL\n\n        Completing the centre drop target bank lights the Captive Cave for\n      capture. Completing the left drop target bank lights the Captive Pit for\n      capture, after a ball has been captured in the Captive Cave. After a ball\n      has been captured in the Captive Pit, the third ball hitting any switch\n      releases the 2 captive balls for 3-ball multi-ball play.\n\n        After capturing a ball in the Captive Cave due to any one of the\n      multi-ball return lanes, hitting any switch releases the ball for 2-ball\n      multi-ball play.\n\n        During multi-ball play, the multi-mode bonus display starts to\n      accumulate points at the rate 1000x the number of balls in play whilst at\n      least 2 balls are in play on the drop targets and red spot targets (2000\n      if 2-ball and 3000 if 3-ball).\n\n        At the end of multi-ball play, the player receives the bonus x\n      multiplier and if the multi-mode level has not been reached the player\n      receives the 6th player score times 1x.\n\n      MULTI-MODE\n      If the multi-mode levels are reached (50'000 for 2-ball and 70'000 for\n      3-ball) then the player receives 2- or 3-ball multi-ball for a period of\n      time based on the 6th player display value.\n\n        During play in multi-mode, the 6th player display decrements at a\n      slower rate when more balls are in play. As balls are lost, the display\n      decrements faster. As the display decrements, the player receives these\n      decremental units as score.\n\n        When the multi-ball bonus reaches zero, the playfield goes dead and\n      waits for the balls to drain. At this time the ball is over and player\n      advances unless the player shooting had previously won an Extra Ball, in\n      which case he shoots again.\n\n\n      MULTIPLIERS\n\n        Completing the 3 drop target bank and either of the 5 drop target banks\n        awards the 2x multiplier.\n\n        Completing the 3 and both 5 drop target banks awards the 3x multiplier.\n        ____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nIn league with the Devil!\n-------------------------\n\n      The Swiss Pinball Site (located at http://www.bigbox.ch/pinball) is\n      rarely updated, but it was here that I read in early April '99 of a\n      Devil's Dare for sale near to Basel. Appropriately enough, the guy\n      selling it has a nice family name that in English means Strangler\".\n      Anyway, Thomas the Strangler turned out to be a very nice man who mixes\n      dance music and has 8'000 LPs and a very nicely equipped home studio.\n      The Devil's Dare he was selling was definitely not as sophisticated -\n      and it didn't sound anywhere near as good as his music - it hummed and\n      buzzed. Nothing electronic was burnt out or corroded though and, besides\n      a motley assortment of drop-targets, some wear above the return lanes\n      and some flaking cabinet paint, the pin was in excellent condition. I\n      wasn't however that captivated so I only offered 250 francs. He wanted\n      more and I went up to 300, my final offer and he accepted. So on the\n      snowy night of April 15 I came to be in league with the Devil.\n\n      I've cleaned the playfield topside, modified the old bad design PBDBs\n      (why were they these?\") and cleaned the target mechs but nothing else.\n      Distracted by the imminent arrival of my baby daughter! Early plays did\n      not endear me to the game though, especially as the humming got worse and\n      it started to reset every 5 seconds...bahh! I also managed to break a\n      drop target with a shot to the central bank.........aha, that's why\n      there's an assortment of targets! The legs were set up so that the\n      playfield was as steep as the north-face of the Eiger but the central\n      targets still took a pasting from any direct shot - so I tried to avoid\n      that..........unfortunately it's a key part of the gameplay. Really\n      frustrating - the pin had got worse since I bought it.\n\n      Then June - the rain rained down like RAIN most days, Ruby arived and the\n      Devil in the cellar was ready to be beat. First I downgraded him from\n      A-20095 Super flipper coils to regular A-17875 coils. Now the playfield\n      has a more moderate slope, helping it to live for an age if not all\n      eternity, and I can play all shots without smashing targets and other\n      plastics to hell. Things are looking up!\n\n      The last trick was the sound and resetting. I checked the capacitor on\n      the bottom power board - it read 25V AC across the contacts, but the\n      bridge rectifer was fine. Dead capacitor! The 5V logic supply was not\n      stable. Once replaced the game was perfect! Oh joy! Simple fault to find\n      and fix in the end but major heartache getting there. Now I can finish\n      cleaning it up and try to work out how to play the thing!\n        ____________________________________________________________________\n\n\n      Devil's Dare was featured (together with the System 80 pin, James Bond\n      007) on a 1997 calendar entitled \"Cats at Work\" from the Abbeville\n      Publishing Group - The picture was on the cover and the month of June.\n      Thanks to Bruce Clark in North Wales, PA for the scan.\n\n       _________________________________________________________________\n\n                          Text \u00a9 Peter Hall 1999.\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Devil's Dare", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/devilsdare.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

Heh, heh, heh...).\n\n Skill Shot  There is a miniature jukebox at the upper right of the playfield.\nWhen a ball is in the plunger lane, the jukebox flashes a series of 5 lights:\n150K, 100K, 75K, 50K & 25K. Plunging the ball sends it to the Upper Left Saucer\nwhere you are awarded whatever value the light stops on. It's somewhat similar\nto the Skill Shot on T2. The first attempt is worth 1X Value, then 2X and 3X.\n\nGoofy sound #1: When awarding the 150,000 value the game says: \"Num-ber One!\"\nIn a cheesy female voice. It's funny the first time but tedious after 40\nor 50 times....\n\n Upper Left Saucer  This sink-hole can be reached one of four ways:\nThe plunger lane, where it awards the Skill Shot value; The Cup Shot, a stray\nbounce through the EAT Lanes, or through the Spinner Shot. This saucer is used\nfor both the Multi-Ball start as well as the Dine-Time Jackpot award.\n\n E-A-T Lanes  3 lanes at the top of the playfield. They can be steered with the\nflippers, and award 2x, 3x, 4x & 5x bonuses. After the 5x bonus the game awards\n100,000 points for each subsequent lighting of all three lanes. Upon completion\nof the three lanes, the game lights the 2 serve food lights at the base of each\nramp, as well as one of the advance dine-time lights in one of the two inlanes.\n\n Jet Bumpers  There are three, in the usual triangular fashion arranged right\nbelow the EAT lanes. The ball can feed to either the right or the left side,\nand it's almost impossible for the ball to fall SDTM.\n\n Grill Shot  A small target to the left of the jet bumpers and underneath the\nCash Register Ramp. This target awards ??? per hit, except when it is hit\nsoon after knocking down a complete bank of drop targets. It then awards 3\nvalues, which increase each subsequent time a bank of drop targets is cleared.\nThe awards are 100K, 250K, 500K, and 1.5M. After the 1.5M shot, the award\nresets back to 100K. On factory settings the award carries over between balls.\n\nGoofy sound #2: An unlit grill shot makes a noise that sounds like someone\nburning himself on a hot griddle and then screaming.\n\n Spinner shot  This is a half-orbit to the left of the jet bumpers that feeds\nthe ball to the Saucer if going fast enough, otherwise the ball will feed to\nthe EAT lanes. There is a mirrored spinner her (like FishTales) that awards\n3000 per spin when lit.\n\n \"Today's Special\" Hole  This is a sinkhole located roughly 2/3 of the way\ndown on the right. A stray bounce will sometimes send it in here, but usually\nthe only way in is through a careful left flipper shot. The sinkhole is lit\nat the beginning of the game, and also from the left inlane. When lit It\nawards 8 random awards- 25K, 50K, 75K, 100K, 250K, Extra Ball, Advance\nDine-Time and Serve Customer. If a ball is locked, the game will (usually)\naward Start Multiball. The eject hole sends the ball to the Upper Left\nsaucer if working correctly. If the eject is not working correctly the\nball will dribble into the plunger lane (feh).\n\n Cash Register Ramp  This is the looping ramp on the left side. It feeds the\nball to the right inlane, and has a small mock-up of a cash register on\ntop. This ramp awards increasing values for consecutive ramp hits of 20K,\n40K, 60K, 80K, 100K, 120K, 140K, ...etc. After 80K the Grill Shot lights for\nan extra ball(one per ball). After 100K each successive ramp shot boosts the\nDine-Time value by 1 million. The left ramp raises following a right ramp shot\nto lock a ball for Multiball. This ramp can easily(?) be backhanded from\nthe left flipper.\n\n Cup Ramp  This is the looping ramp on the right side. It feeds the ball to the\nleft inlane after crossing the Cash Register ramp over the jet bumpers. When\nshot for the first time during the game two things happen: the diverter on the\nleft ramp raises to allow a ball to be locked, and the diverter on the Cup\nramp swings to the side to allow a shot at the large plastic cup at the top\ncenter of the playfield(\"Stir The Cup\"). This diverter stays open for about\n10 seconds, while the ball lock will stay open until a ball is locked, even\nbetween balls.\n\n The Cup  This is the large plastic bowl that's supposed to look like a coffee\ncup at the top of the playfield, and one of the key shots in the game. Balls\nthat enter here will travel rapidly around the cup, similarly to the whirlpool\nin CFTBL, tripping over a sensor each time. Each 2 revolutions of the ball\nadvance one of the DINER lights in the middle of the playfield. The cup shot\nbonus is 10x the light value. the awards go like this: D-25K, I-50K,\nN-75K, E-100K, R-250K. After the R is lit each successive revolution\nis worth another 10X100K up to a maximum of 10X350K or 3.5 Million. Following\na successful cup shot the ball will drain into the EAT lanes. Successive cup\nshots requires the right ramp to be shot 5 times before the diverter\nwill open again.\n\n Your Customers  represented by five lights below the DINER lights and\nin front of the flippers: At the start of each game a customer is randomly\nselected to give you their order. The customer is served by hitting all\nsix drop targets, which then reset. The next customer then barks out their\norder, etc. This continues until all five customers have been served at which\npoint Dine-Time starts.\n\n\nIf the EAT lanes have been lit the white arrow lights at the base of\neach ramp will light to spot 1 bank of targets for each successful right\nor left ramp shot.\n\nWhen you serve a customer a voice says \"Order up!\" and the Grill shot\nlights for about 10 seconds for the Grill bonus shot.\n\nSome more Goofy Sounds (in various un-PC accents):\n\n\n  Haji: \"Could you please give to me a Hot Dog and a Root Beer?...\"\n  Babs (who looks suspiciously like Margaret Thatcher): \"I'd like an\nIced Tea and a Frankfurter...\"\n  Boris (looks just like Gorbachev!): \"I'll have Burger and Fries!...\"\n  Pepe: \"Gimme the Chili and a Root Beer!...\"\n  Buck: \"I'll have the Texas Chili and Fries!...\"\n\n\nYour customers will also taunt you if they think you are taking too long.\n\n\n  Haji: \"Come on, man. You are too slow!\"\n  Babs: \"Really, I haven't got all day!\"\n  Boris: \"Hey! Get lead out!\"\n  Pepe: \"Andelay, andelay!\" (sp?)\n  Buck: \"Hurry up, partner!\"\n\n\n\n Drop Targets  there are two banks of three, positioned similarly to Dracula.\nOne bank is on the left about halfway down, the other in front of the\nflippers just below the jet bumpers. The left targets have the Root Beer,\nFries and Iced Tea lights. The right have the Hot Dog, Burger and Chili Lights.\nIf you knock down one or two targets in a bank and then drain, the game resets\nall three (grr...)\n\n Multiball  A 2-ball multiball, and fairly easy to get, as multiballs go.\nWhen the left ramp raises for ball lock the ball travels under the\nraised ramp to land in a saucer underneath. The left ramp then lowers, another\nball is fed to the plunger, and the Spinner shot lights for the ball release.\nThe ball must be shot through the spinner so it lands in the upper left saucer\nto start multiball. The other way is to get the \"Start Multiball\" award from the\n\"Special\" sinkhole.\n\n\nThere are two main objectives to multiball. The obvious one is to nail\nall the drop targets, which can happen very quickly. The other is to get the:\n\n\n Rush  The secondary multiball feature. During multiball, the upper left saucer\nand the \"Special\" sinkhole light for \"Beat The Rush\" These lights stay on for\nabout 10-15 seconds, or until one or more balls drain. The saucer is \"Rush #1\"\nand the sinkhole is \"Rush #2\", and I think you have to nail them in that order.\nWhen both shots are made the game says \"B-b-b-b-bbbaby\" (Sounds just\nlike Elvis!) and each ramp is lit for 500K per ramp for the duration of\nmultiball. Cool.\n\n Dine-Time  THE shot of the game, and the only real way to the BIG POINTS.\nWhen the last customer is served, the Spinner shot lights for the jackpot shot.\nThe ball MUST land in the saucer to get the award, which is 1 million X the\ncurrent Clock value, to a maximum of 12 million. There is a backdoor into the\njackpot shot, which happens when the ball goes in the \"Special\" sinkhole and\nis then fired into the saucer. The jackpot is lit for about 10-15 seconds,\nafter which the game resets the last served customer and you start that\ncustomer over (grrr...)\n\nI've never gotten more than one Dine-Time in a game, so I have no idea what\nhappens if you got 2 or 3 (although I suppose I could take the glass off\nand look...naahhh.)\n\n End-of-ball Bonus  some number which I've I think is determined by Jet Bumper\nhits (can anyone verify?) X the multiplier. In addition each served customer\ncounts as a 1%(of the bonus) tip, which is added afterward. The end of ball\nbonus is no big deal...\n\n\nOther Stuff\n\n Cows  There aren't any, at least none that I've seen. Maybe too early for cows.\nDamn.\n\n Ballsaver  One of the outlanes is lit when your first two balls are real\nstinkers(the time is operator settable). The lane is steerable with the\nflippers, and awards an extra ball when hit during a right or left drain.\n\n Death Saves and Bang Backs  I'm no wizard, but I can do a Death Save from the\nright 75% of the time. I would imagine BBs are possible, but the large\nnasty bruises I get have discouraged me from trying further.\n\n Strategies  Hit right Ramp. Hit cup shot for 3.5M. Lock ball. Nail left ramp\nrepeatedly to increase Dine-Time value and light extra ball. Release Ball.\nDuring multiball go for \"Get the Rush\". Serve the customers and get your\nprize. Repeat.\n\n\nNo, really, that's basically it. Diner does not have a particularly deep\nrule set, but it does offer the novice to intermediate player a challenging\nway to improve his/her game without a confusing bunch of stuff to shoot at,\nlike most newer games.\n\nBragging (Hah!)- My high score is only 23.5M, so there. Kevin, Lyman or\nPhaedrus probably get that on their first ball...\n\nThat's it! If you are familiar with this game and have any additions, I'd love\nto hear them.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Diner", "manufacturer": "Bally/Williams/WMS Mfg.", "possible_shots": "The Clock, Flippers, Plunger, Skill Shot, Upper Left Saucer, E-A-T Lanes, Jet Bumpers, Grill Shot, Spinner shot, Today's Special Hole, Cash Register Ramp, Cup Ramp, The Cup, Your Customers, Drop Targets, Multiball, Rush, Dine-Time, End-of-ball Bonus, Ballsaver, Death Saves and Bang Backs", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/diner.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Diner", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "From: ls2r+@andrew.cmu.edu (Lui Sieh)\nSubject: Spoiler! Long (was Re: Diner strategy?)\nDate: 3 Dec 90 18:36:45 GMT\n\nExcerpts From Captions of netnews.rec.games.pinball:\n 3-Dec-90  Diner strategy?                Gregory M. Paris@rayssd. (415)\n>I've had a few opportunities lately to play the game Diner (at airports\n>and such), but haven't hit on an effective strategy for winning.  Should\n>I run into one of these games again, I'd like to be able to do a little\n>better.  Anyone familiar with this game want to provide a summary of the\n>best strategy you've found?  If so, please post.\n\nHere is a strategy that was not developed by me but by a collective of people\nplayin on our campus DINER game.  Credit probably goes to TEC for developing\nit fully.  He was the person who got 55 Mil on it (as well as several 45 Mils\non it)\n\nThe following strategy however, may become very mechanical and other issues\nwhich relate to strategy will be subject to another post.\n\n1)  Always go and lock the ball.  Hit the right rmap shot to raise the left\nramp in order to lock.\n\n2) lock the ball and release it.  You can release through using either the\n\"normal\" release shot (looks like the Gorby shot on Taxi) or use the \"hole\"\nshot on the side (looks like the planet shot on PinBot) to get the Diner\nspecial start-multi ball.  (I don't think the words are right but you get\nthe idea I hope).\n\n3)  With multi-ball try to thrash alot and knock down the targets to collect\nthe people in order to light Dine-Time jackpot shot.  It is *not* important\nto light the 500K ramp shots to get points that way.\n\n4)  Repeat above 3\n\nDeviations to this above outline:\n\nI also make use of the Grill shot (looks like the Taxi one too).  That shot\nis worth collectively more than 2.5 Mil.  By hitting down one set of targets\nyou light Grill shot worth 100K 250K 500K and 1500K (1.5 M).  You can get a\nfree game just on this strategy alone if for some reason you have a hard\ntime getting the ramp shots down.\n\nIt is nice also to fill in E-A-T to help light the food shots on the ramps\nsince it will help you get to the DINE TIME jackpot sooner but again it isn't\nall that important because with multi-ball those targets will fall fast with\ntwo balls in play.\n\nFinally, the cup shot with the 10X shot is the one shot *not* to shoot for.\nIt is not worth it when using the above strategy.  The problem with that shot\nis that once you get it, you will have to hit the right ramp shot another 5\ntimes in order to enable lock which as I have stated and will state again is\nthe *primary* purpose in a game because it will represent the most points and\nthe fastest way to get points and replay score.  That cup shot depending on\nthe game's condition will be worth up to 3.1 M or a mere 500 or 750K.  With\nthese points it will not be worth it for losing the ability to play multiball\nwhich is worth much more.\n\nIn this case, I don't agree with David Tate in a previous article about DINER\nand how to play it.  The left ramp is rather important because it will light\nthe extra ball (the Grill shot) and also advance DINE TIME jackpot as will\nlighting the E-A-T since this will light the advance the jackpot in the inner\nlanes.  The right ramp again is important because it enables lock rather than\nfor the 10X cup shot.  So, while it is true that DINER's multiball does not\nlead directly to a jackpot shot per se, it will help immeasurably in knocking\ndown the targets in order to light the jackpot shot.\n\nI hope this was rather clear.  If not, send some e-mail\n\nBTW, the above strategy ought to give you an average between 5-7 Million\npoints.  Should be plenty for airport games.  Mileage will vary due to skill\nand accounting for \"off days\".  And if you find it becoming  \"mechanical\"\nthen vary when boredome sets in.\n\n-Lui\n\nls2r+@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Diner", "possible_shots": "lock the ball, right ramp shot, normal release shot, hole shot, Grill shot, E-A-T, cup shot with the 10X shot", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/diner-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

To the best of our knowledge, the\ninformation contained in this rule sheet is accurate. However, due to\nvarious ROM editions, operator setup options, and tournament\nmodes, the rules of any particular game may deviate from those\nlisted below. The rules of the game are always final, and any discrepancies\nbetween this rule sheet and the actual game rules cannot\nbe used as a basis for protest.\n\nThis rule sheet is based on rules provided courtesy of Williams Electronics,\nand updated by Don Coons and Dave Stewart for distribution at PAPA-5.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nUse the left flipper to select one of the three possible awards on the\ndisplay. Pulling the trigger launches the ball and awards the highlighted\nselection on the display. The choices are:\n\n\n Ramp shot  Magna-force activates, giving the player a slow feed to\nthe upper flipper for the left ramp shot for a point award skill shot.\nThis value increases after every previous successful skill shot.\n\n Load gun  The ball is loaded into the gun, and the skill shot target is\nthe HQ, or mode start hole. If made, you will be awarded a skill\nshot value, and the current flashing mode will start. [Strategy:\nAlways go for this. Not only does it give you points, starting at\n5M incrementing by 5M every successful time, but it also lights a\nmode].\n\n 3 Bullets  Spot 3 bullet targets.\n\n 2 Million  Collect 2M points\n\n BONUS X  Advance bonus multiplier.\n\n\nMultiball\nCompleting all five badges (HQ, Left Ramp, Safehouse, warehouse,\nright ramp) will light multiball.\n\nTo start multiball, shoot the left ramp or the warehouse to load the\ngun. The right ramp is jackpot, the left ramp is super jackpot (2x jackpot).\nThe player gets one shot with the gun at super jackpot, and then\nmultiball play commences. Super jackpot will stay lit permanently\nthroughout multiball, if a jackpot is made, the warehouse will relight\njackpot.\n\nSuper Jackpots start at 50M, regular jackpots at 25M, jackpots values\nare increased by hitting warehouse during multiball.\n\nIf no jackpots were made during multiball, there will be a last change\njackpot during single ball play immediately after multiball. The player\nthen has a short time to make a jackpot shot.\n\nModes and Major Awards\nShotgun Shell Modes\n\nShooting the outer loops will light the HQ hole. Shooting the HQ hole\nwhen lit will start the current flashing shotgun shell mode. They are:\n\n\n Barroom Brawl  A 25-second timed mode. Shoot the ramps as much\nas possible. The left ramp is worth twice as much as the right\nramp, and initial value of the right ramp is 10M.\n\n Car Chase  A 20-second timed mode. Shoot both loops and the left\nramp. If the player makes four shots in any combination before\nthe time runs out, the player will receive an added finishing bonus.\n\n Warehouse Raid  A 25-second timed mode. Shoot the warehouse as\nmuch as possible for 10M+5M and contraband items.\n\n Letter bomb  Shoot the safehouse four times within 25 seconds.\nEvery switch is awarded a `bomb value,' which is initially 100K\nand increases after each safehouse hit. Score starts at 25M.\n\n Meet the Mob  Both ramps and both loops are lit for 20 seconds.\nShoot each one once before the timer expires.\n\n Stop Scorpio  Various crosshair pointer lights are flashing and timing\ndown. Shooting one turns it off, and another lights up, and\nstarts timing down. Crosshair shots can be added by shooting the\nsafehouse. Each ramp is worth 15M during mode, HQ hole value\nstarts at 10M, mode stops when you hit HQ hole. The mode is\nover when a) all crosshairs time out, b) when the ball is shot into\nthe HQ hole, where the player is given bonus finishing points,\nwhich is the total ramp scores plus HQ value.\n\n\nCompleting all modes starts a 6 ball multiball. During this mode any\narrest made is worth 50M. The three arrest targets lit are the warehouse,\nsafehouse, and the mode start hole.\n\nSafehouse\n\nThe Safehouse is lit by advancing your rank on the left ramp. The\nsafehouse awards occur in this order:\n\n\n Bank Robber Hurry-up  A hurry-up that starts at 50M, and is collected\nby shooting the left loop.\n\n Warehouse Hurry-up  Shoot the warehouse before the hurry-up finishes\nand the player is rewarded with a two ball multiball where\nthe jackpot value is the hurry-up value, and the jackpot shot is the\nwarehouse. Value starts at 20M.\n\n Light Extra Ball  Lights the Extra Ball at the HQ hole.\n\n Super Loops  Both loops are lit for a short time. Shoot a loop to\nrestart the timer, and increase the loop value for the next shot.\n\n Alcatraz  A multiball where the jackpot is on a flashing crosshair\nshot. Make it, and it moves to another crosshair.\n\n\nBullets And The Magazine\n\nCompleting all of the bullet targets scattered around on the playfield,\nadvances the awards on the MAGAZINE by flashing the lowest available.\nShoot the Warehouse to collect the lowest flashing award on the\nmagazine.\n\nThe awards are:\n\n\n Magnum Jets  Until the end of the current ball, all jet hits are worth\n1M.\n\n Magnum Bullets  Until the end of the current ball, all bullet targets\nare worth millions.\n\n Light Extra Ball  Lights the Extra Ball at the HQ hole.\n\n Light Shoot-out  The exits are lit. If the ball drains on an exit, the\ncurrent player is instantly thrown into a multiball where the player\nmust complete all of the bullet targets. Balls are continuously fed\nfor a short period of time. After 20 seconds, all balls are drained,\nand the player's ball is over.\n\n Playfield Promotion  All scores are multiplied by up to 5x for a\nshort period of time. The multiplier is based on what the player's\ncurrent RANK is, which is earned by multiple shots up the left\nramp.\n\n\nAlways trap ball and look at the warehouse for lit awards, since most\nof the time you end up picking up bullets from bullet ricochets.\n\nRegulation Play and Non-mode Stuff\n\n Lanes and bumpers  The lanes alternately increase jet value and\nmultiply the current ransom value. The ransom value is built by\nthe jets and unlit HQ hole shots.\n\n Return Lanes  If the ball rolls down the left return lane, Magna\nForce is lit for a short period of time on the right loop. If the shot\nis made, Magna Force will grab the ball, award points, and then\nallow a slow feed to the upper flipper for a shot at the left ramp.\nThe right return lane briefly light ransom at the HQ hole. If made,\nthe ransom shot collects the ransom value. Ransom can be multiplied\nby the upper lanes above the jets, or by making combination\nshots just before making the ransom shot (therefore, the ransom\nshot would be the player's last shot in the combo.)\n\n Left ramp  Multiple shots up the left ramp will earn the player\nincreasing ranks. Achieving a new rank lights the safehouse.\n\n Right Ramp  Multiple right ramp shots, called helicopters, lights\n`Feel Lucky' at the warehouse. Shooting the right ramp twice consecutively\nwill divert the ball to the right flipper, and light `ricochet'\nfor a short period of time on the left loop.\n\n\nWarehouse\nContraband can be collected at the warehouse when lit. These items\nare usually worth just points, but they can be worth an extra ball.\n\nWarehouse also collects the lowest flashing magazine award when lit.\n\nWhen Feel Lucky is lit, and the warehouse shot is made, the player\nthen has the opportunity to choose between two awards using the flippers.\nThe left flipper will award points, the right flipper will load the\ngun for a shot at a flashing bullet target. If the gun shot is successful,\nthe player earns a better award, these awards could be double points\n(of the left flipper choice), extra balls, super ricochet (where ricochet\nis lit for the rest of the ball), bonus X's, etc.\n\nTournament Settings\nThe following settings will be in effect at PAPA:\n\n\n Skill Shot  You will always be able to select for Ramp Shot and\nLoad Gun. The third choice will follow this pattern: Ball 1: Bonus\nX, Ball 2: Millions, Ball 3: 3 Bullets.\n\n Feel Lucky Awards  The award choices will not be random, but will\ninstead occur in this order: double feel lucky points, advance magazine,\nadvance rank, bonus multiplier, super ricochet, hold bonus.\n\n Shotgun Shell Modes  The modes will not be randomized by the\nslings or jets. They will occur in this order: Barroom Brawl, car\nchase, warehouse raid, letter bomb, meet the mob, stop scorpio,\ncrime wave.\n\n\nNo extra balls will be awarded. The Light Extra Ball on the magazine\nwill be skipped over.\n\nStrategy Summary\nAlways go for start mode skill shot from gun]\n\nGet the left ramp shot down, its a tough shot.\n\nAlways aim for super jackpot on gun shot to start multiball, other\njackpots are pretty easily gotten form right ramp. If you miss super\nfrom gun, hold a couple of balls on the left flipper and shot the\nother ball from the right flipper to the left loop this will feed the\nupper right flipper for another shot at the super jackpot. Then alternate\nright ramp/ warehouse for other jackpots.\n\nGet the right and left loop shots down, a lot of timed awards can be\ncollected here.\n\nAny time you go down the left return lane go for the right loop.\nOnce you get the left ramp shot down it can be very lucrative.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Dirty Harry", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronics", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/dirtyharry.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Dirty Harry", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Dr. Dude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Dr. Dude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Dude\" Rules Sheet\nVersion 1.0 (April 1, 1994)\nBy Michael Dunn\n\n\n\nPreliminaries\n\n\nDr. Dude is the coolest dude in the known pinball universe, hands down.\nIf you have any hope of hanging with his Dudeness, you'll have to become as\ncool as he is.  Collect the three Elements of Coolness, mix them all together\nin the Mix Master, shake well, and Dr. Dude will reward you with a round of\nMultiball and a chance at some super cool jackpots.\n\nThere is a really neat comic-strip-like drawing on the backglass that\ngives Dr. Dude's personal history.  If I still had access to the pin, I'd put\nthe text here, it's really neat.  HINT HINT If anyone can help me out here, I'd\nreally appreciate it. :)\n\nOnce again, I'm writing a rules sheet entirely from memory (I think it's\nmy calling in life), so please forgive any colossal goofs.  If there's\nsomething that I'm unsure of, I'll flag it with a question mark, so you'll know\nit's a guess.\n\n#include <std-disclaimers.h>\n\nBefore we begin your tour of Dr. Dude, it will be helpful to know that\nI'll use the abbreviations \"K\" for a thousand points, and \"M\" for a million\npoints.  Also, when I refer to parts of the game that are named, I'll\ncapitalize them so you know you can find info about them here.\n\nGeneral Layout\nStarting at the lower-left corner and going clockwise, here's what you'll find\non Dr. Dude:\n\n\n Left In/Outlane   Nothing special here.  There is no kickback!  The inlane\ndoesn't light anything, and I don't -think- the outlane can be lit.(?)\n\n Magnetic Personality   This is one of the Elements of Coolness.  There is a\nsingle standup target at the end of a short curved lane.  You must hit the\ntarget to get credit for a shot to Magnetic Personality.  The cool thing is\nthat there's a magnet halfway up the lane that catches the ball when the\ntarget is hit.  When the ball rolls out of the lane, it should land on the\nleft flipper, but if the slingshot is sensitive it may fire and send the\nball zooming off across the board.  See the Rules section for more info on\nthe Elements.  This is also the Reflex 3 shot.\n\n Left Lane   The ball can exit the bumpers down this lane.  Shoot the ball up\nthis lane to reach...\n\n Left Saucer   This saucer can score Bag O' Tricks, Reflex 1, Special, Extra\nBall, and Lock.  The ball exits by a vertical upkick onto a winding\nhabitrail that feeds the left inlane.  Several awards may be lit at once\nhere, but one shot will collect all of them.\n\n Ramp   A very, very steep ramp.  It can only be shot with the right flipper.\nIt loops around the back side of the board and leads to the Mix Master.  The\nramp collects the Million award when lit.  Did I mention how steep it is?\n\n Heart of Rock 'n Roll   The second Element of Coolness.  It is a single standup\ntarget just to the right of the ramp entrance.\n\n Bumpers   Three bumpers in a triangle.  They don't build towards anything, but\nthey do give you points. The ball can exit down the Left Lane, or down the\nmiddle of the board.  If the one-way gate at the end of the Right Lane is\nbusted/stuck the ball can exit that way too.\n\n Top Target   This is a single standup above the bumpers.  A ball that is\nplunged or shot strongly up the Right Lane will hit the target and fall into\nthe bumpers (or maybe roll back down the Lane if the one-way gate is out of\naction).  The target's value is determined by the lights on the back panel\nabove the target; the value cycles through 5 awards, from 5K to 100K(?).\nThis target is always available.\n\n REFLEX Targets   These 6 standup targets are to the right of the bumpers.  They\nare angled to the left, so you can shoot them with the flippers as well.\nCompleting them lights or increases the value of the Reflex award.  The\ntargets you hit are saved between balls.\n\n The Gift of Gab   The third Element of Coolness.  There is a big yellow box\nwith a bow on top that covers a short straight lane.  The lane leads to a\nsaucer, which you must hit to get credit for a shot to the Gift.  The ball\nexits by a vertical upkick onto a habitrail that feeds the right inlane.\nThis is also the Reflex 2 shot.\n\n The Mix Master   This contraption is suspended above the board, but it doesn't\nhide anything on the playfield except the top portion of the Right Lane.\nInside the Mix Master is a spinning disk with a post attached.  The sides of\nthe Mix Master form a figure that resembles a triangle with the corners cut\noff to form a six-sided shape.  The ball is dropped off the Ramp on to the\ncenter of the disk, and there is a hole in the bottom side that leads to a\nhabitrail that feeds the Right Inlane.\n\nScoring is controlled by 9 standup targets placed around the sides of the\nMix Master.  Each bank of 3 targets corresponds to an Element of Coolness:\nred for the Heart of Rock 'n Roll, yellow for the Gift of Gab, and green for\nMagnetic Personality.  These targets spot shots to the Elements, light Lock,\nand build towards the Jackpot during Multiball.\n\n Right Lane   This is a half-orbit shot that leads to the Top Target and the\nBumpers.  The Plunger also sends balls up this lane.\n\n Drop Targets   Four drop targets, facing directly left, placed below the\nentrance to the Right Lane.  Completing them awards bonus multipliers the\nfirst three times (2x, 4x, and 6x), lights Million the fourth time, and\nawards points after that.  During Multiball, they also double the current\nJackpot.\n\n Right In/Outlanes   Nothing special here either, as far as I can remember.\n\n Plunger   A manual plunger.  The plunger sends the ball up the Right Lane.\n\n Flippers/Slingshots   2 of each, in the regular spots.\n\n\nNow on to the rules...\n\nThe Elements of Coolness\nEach Element of Coolness has three lights on the board to indicate the\nnumber of times it's been hit and its value, and a globe light somewhere on the\nsurrounding plastic that is flashing when the Element has not been collected,\nand steady when it has been collected.\n\nThe first shot to an Element scores 5K and lights the \"5,000\" light.  The\nsecond shot scores 10K and lights the \"10,000\" light.  The third shot collects\nthe element, scores 25K, and resets the scoring lights.  Once an Element is\ncollected, you can continue to shoot it for points; its value cycles between\n5K-10K-25K.\n\nThe values of all three Elements are held between balls, and none of the\nvalues time out.\n\nYou can also get credit for a shot to an Element by hitting the\ncorresponding targets in the Mix Master several times, 5 maybe(?).\n\nOnce you collect all three Elements, hitting any target in the Mix Master\nlights Lock at the Left Saucer.  Note that shooting the Ramp is not enough; the\nball must hit at least one target in the Mix Master to light Lock.\n\nMultiball\nMultiball is pretty simple: shoot the Mix Master as much as possible.  The\ndisplay shows a counter, which is the number of Mix Master target hits you need\nto collect the jackpot.  During Multiball, all 9 targets work the same; a hit\nto any target decreases the counter by 1.\n\nThe jackpot is worth from 1M to 5M.  The value seems to be random from one\njackpot to the next.  Completing the Drop Targets doubles the value of the\ncurrent jackpot.\n\nThe target counter starts at 15 for the first jackpot, and goes up by 10\nfor each subsequent jackpot on the same Multiball.  The counter is reset to 15\nat the start of each Multiball round.\n\nDuring Multiball, the Elements of Coolness are available, but they just\nscore points -- you can't collect Elements for later Multiballs.\n\nOnce one ball drains, regular play resumes.  There is no restart shot.\nAll scores are doubled as long as you keep the remaining ball in play.\n\nREFLEX\nThe Reflex round is a sequence of three shots in quick succession.  First,\ncomplete the Reflex targets to light Reflex 1 at the Left Saucer.  Reflex 1\nstays lit until you hit it.  Shoot the saucer to light Reflex 2 at the Gift of\nGab.  Reflex 2 times out *very* quickly; if you miss it on the first try you\ndon't often get a second chance.  Shooting Reflex 2 lights Reflex 3 at Magnetic\nPersonality.  Reflex 3 has a slightly longer timer, and you will usually have\ntime for two or three shots.  Shooting Reflex 3 awards completes the round and\nawards the Reflex bonus.\n\nThe Reflex value starts at 500K.  Completing the Reflex Targets when\nReflex 1 is already lit adds 250K to the value, and completing the Reflex\nsequence adds 500K to the value.  The Reflex value carries over throughout the\nentire game.\n\nIf you miss Reflex 2, Reflex 1 is re-lit immediately.  But if you miss\nReflex 3, the Reflex round ends and you must hit the Reflex Targets to relight\nReflex 1.\n\nReflex is available during Multiball, but the timers on Reflex 2 and 3 are\nmuch much longer.\n\nBag of Tricks\nThe Bag of Tricks is a random award.  Collect it by shooting the Left\nSaucer.  It is lit at the start of each ball, and is relit by the Drop Targets.\nIt is not available during Multiball, but if you complete the Drop Targets\nduring Multiball, it will be lit once Multiball ends.  Possible awards are:\n\n\n A measly 10 points\n Slingshots score 100,000:  This can be worth a bundle if you don't mind giving up control of the ball to the slingshots.\n Added 1 tilt warning:  This is NOT an April Fool's joke!\n Lit Magnetic Personality\n Received the Gift of Gab\n Found the Heart of Rock 'n Roll\n Light Mix Master:  This spots all unlit Elements.\n Million is lit:  Shoot the ramp for 1M.\n Jackpot at max:  The next jackpot is worth 5M.\n Bonus X at max:  The end-of-ball bonus multiplier is raised to 6x.  A side\neffect is that the next time you complete the Drop Targets, Million will be\nlit.\n Extra Ball is lit:  Shoot the Left Saucer for an extra ball.\n Special is lit:  Shoot the Left Saucer for a special.\n\n\nThe Elements of Coolness are always awarded in the order Magnetic Personality,\nGift of Gab, Heart of Rock 'n Roll.\n\nMiscellaneous Stuff\n\n Right Lane Scoring   The Right Lane has three values, similar to the Elements.\nI don't remember the values themselves, but I think they are different than\nthe 5/10/25K values of the Elements.(?)\n\n Free Extra Ball   If, at the start of ball 3, you're not doing too well, Dr.\nDude will take pity on you and light Extra Ball at the Left Saucer.\n\n Double Scoring   When all scores are doubled, awards are displayed as their\ndoubled values.\n\n\nStrategies\nThere aren't too many awards to go for on the way to Multiball.  If you\nfeel confident in shooting the Drop Targets, you can go for the million award.\n\nReflex is always good to shoot for.  If you miss Reflex 2 on the first\nshot, let the timer run out.  The timer is so short that in order to get a\nsecond shot at it you need to make an uncontrolled shot, and if you miss again\na drain is more likely.  So, if you miss it the first time, take your time, get\nthe ball under control, and start over with Reflex 1.\n\nTry not to get both balls in the Mix Master.  They tend to hit each other\nmore often than the targets, and if both of them come out together, it's very\ntough to get either one back up the ramp.\n\nAnother Multiball tip:  If you catch one ball on the left flipper, keep it\nthere!  Then keep looping the Ramp with the other ball.  When I get one ball in\nthe Mix Master, I always try to catch the other ball right away.\n\nDon't take your attention off a ball that's in the Mix Master.  More than\nonce I've been surprised by a ball that hit the post on the spinning disk and\nwas sent zooming out the exit and down the habitrail.  If you send a ball up\nthe Ramp and you're sure it'll make it all the way around, you can take your\nattention away from it for 2 or 3 seconds, but that's about the only time a\nball is totally safe to ignore.\n\nClosing Credits\nWell, I don't have anyone to credit.  All you see above came from me!  But\nI'm sure I forgot something about the game, so if you help me out your name\nwill appear here, for all to see. :>\n\nP.S.:  Did I mention how steep the ramp is?\n\nBy the Same Author\nRules sheets for:\n\n \"Back to the Future\"\n \"Banzai Run\"\n \"Rollergames\"\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Dr. Dude", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/drdude.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Dr. Dude", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Dr. Who\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Dr. Who\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a Rules Sheet\nfor Doctor Who!\n\nversion 1.02d - 3/31/93\n\n\nSomething you might want to know first off: Whenever a point value is\nused, you may assume it to be multiplied by the \"Playfield X\" unless it says it\nain't.  Otherwise, I'd have to go through every single little thing and say\n\"This is worth 25OK, but it can be worth up to a million!\"... just so you know.\n\nPlayfield Description and Basic Rules (we'll do this from left to right):\n\n \"Hang-On\" target  shot at the left side of the game, just past the\nupper flipper - awards either the \"Hang-On\" or \"Collision\" bonuses, and\ndepending on circumstances, \"H\" in \"W-H-O\" and/or a Sonic Boom.  Scoring on\nHang-On and Collision will be explained later.\n\n REPAIR targets  set of six circular targets along the left side of the\nmain area of the playfield.  They can only be shot directly from the right\nflipper, and are more likely to be hit on a carom shot from some other flipper.\nScoring on the Repair targets is a bit weird and will be explained later.\n\n Bonus X shot  Just to the left of the Time Expander area, the shot\nwraps around the back of the Expander to the Jet Bumpers.  A Bonus X is awarded\nfor shooting the Jet Bumpers and NOT the \"Bonus X shot\", so this shot doesn't\ndo anything in particular.\n\n Time Expander  the big thing in the middle.  There are three modes for\nthe Expander:\n\n\n 1st - \"Lock Mode\" - the Expander has 2 locks, to the left and right of a\ncircular target.  Locking 2 balls leads to...\n 2nd - \"Target Mode\" also known as \"Pinbot Mode\" - there are 5 spherical\ntargets, and a hit on them is registered by the red lights just below\nit.  Completing all the lights leads to...\n 3rd - \"Jackpot Mode\" - there are 3 small gates with metal posts between them;\neach gate has a picture of a Dalek on it.  Shooting balls through all 3\ngates awards a Jackpot or Super Jackpot, depending on the situation.\n\n\n \"Hole\"  (for lack of a better word) nothing big, just a hole between\nthe Expander and the Transmat target with which you can shoot the Jet Bumpers\nwith the upper flipper.  This will award a Bonus X, so it's equivalent to\nshooting the \"Bonus X shot\".\n\n Transmat target  when lit (by hitting the Jet Bumpers enough times),\nit will spot a Doctor and award points (usually somewhere near 1M, 75OK\nminimum).  If not lit, just awards the points.  Either way, it creates rather\nannoying flashing lights and sound.  May also generate a Cow - more later.\n\n Loop Ramp  aka \"Cliffhanger Ramp\" - shot by the upper flipper, it\nawards a loop (every 1O loops yields a Sonic Boom round), and increases the\nPlayfield X by one value (from, say, 2X to 2.5X).  If the Playfield X is at its\nmaximum (4X), the Loop Ramp awards 25OK instead (yes, 25OK... times 4 it's a\nmillion).  Also completes \"W-H-O\" when lit, and awards a Sonic Boom (also\nending the Boom Round) if lit for that.  At the end of the Loop Ramp is a\ndiverter which sends the ball either back to the upper flipper or all the way\nto the lower left flipper.\n\n Jet Bumpers  each hit increases the Transmat value by 5OK and awards\nsome hokey and unimportant number of points.  The ball can leave the Jet\nBumpers through the \"Hole\" or it will enter the...\n\n Police Box entryway  if lit (by completing \"Escape\"), will begin Video\nMode.  Also always spots a letter on Escape.  Either way, the ball comes out\nthrough the Police Box to the right flipper.\n\n Right Ramp  will award the letter \"W\" in W-H-O anytime when hit; this\nvalue, as is the value of the \"H\" and \"O\" shots (only lit after \"W\" is shot\nfirst), is the highest flashing value beneath the ramp (up to 3M).  Will also\naward a Sonic Boom if lit.\n\n ESCAPE targets  completing all six targets lights Video Mode at the\nPolice Box entryway, and also the value just below the targets (up to 3M, also\nawards Special when lit).  Escape gets one letter spotted when the entryway is\nshot.\n\n Slingshots  yawn... well there are two of them, same as always.\n\n Flippers  three, the normal two plus the upper flipper positioned at\nthe bottom of the Hang-On target.  Generally used to aim the ball, though\nbeginners may tend to flail randomly...\n\n Outlanes and Center Drain  the Drain is a lot larger than some games,\nthough the only shots which result in a center drain are shots at the Time\nExpander and the REPAIR targets.  The outlanes are also cruel - no kickback, no\nrubber posts.  The inlane/outlane divider is also quite a bit lower (nearly\nhalfway down the slingshot) than most games, which leads to even more outlane\ndrains.  More bad news: the flippers are high above the drain hole, so Death\nSaves are more difficult.\n\n\nThe Doctors, and more specific rules:\nThere are 7 Doctors, as one can plainly see from the backglass... quite\nconveniently, they are numbered 1-7.  Each Doctor has the effect of changing\nthe rules of one area of the Playfield, making a list of the rules all the\nmore annoying and probably confusing.\n\nFirst some general information about the Doctors... there are many ways\nto \"spot\" doctors throughout the game - one is awarded at the start of any\nball, and can be spotted through the Transmat target or Video Mode.  At the\nstart of a ball (or when a ball has been locked), you get to choose the\n\"current\" doctor - his picture will flash on the backglass.  When a doctor-\nspotting shot is made, the current doctor will become solidly lit (so his\nattributes are carried over for the rest of the game), and the \"current\" doctor\nbecomes the previously unlit doctor directly to the left of the previous one.\n\nThere are 2 ways to spot all seven doctors - either go through them all\none-by-one, or shoot the Emperor Daleks jackpot.  Either way, all of them will\nbe lit for the rest of the game, and you receive an additional bonus of 2OM, as\nwell as a small animation, which plays even after a tilt!  After all 7 doctors\nare spotted, they can be spotted a second (third, etc) time, and running\nthrough all 7 a second time awards another 2OM bonus.  Also, each doctor\nspotted in the game (this count may be more than 7) is worth a 1M bonus at the\nend of the last ball (so don't tilt it!), and this bonus (unlike the regular\nbonus) is multiplied by the Playfield X.\n\nIt's best to go through all the Doctors one by one and describe what\neach does to the game.\n\nDoctor #1\nAll Doc 1 does is award an extra letter to \"Escape\" on the lower\nright each time an Escape shot is made, either by shooting the targets directly\nor shooting into the Police Box Entryway.  When shooting the Entryway, two\nEscape letters are spotted instead of just one (specifically the two highest,\nbut who cares?), and when shooting the targets directly, the lowest letter is\nspotted, along with any you happened to get with the shot itself.  Each time\n\"Escape\" is completed, it yields the highest flashing award just below the\nletters (which usually begins at 1M, some settings 5OOK), and advances the\nvalue to the next level.  There probably is a timer, but if there is one, it is\na very slow one.  After awarding 3M on \"Escape\", the Special will be lit on the\ntargets.  Just shoot \"Escape\" one more time to claim the credit.\n\nMore importantly, completing \"Escape\" lights\n\nVIDEO MODE\n\nat the Police Box entryway.  (big letters cuz it's a big deal)\n\nVideo Mode is pretty simple - all you do is control the Doctor as he\njumps over obstacles while running from a Dalek.  One flipper for a short jump\n(will clear one small obstacle), both for a long jump (clears two small or one\nlarge obstacle).  For most waves, you only have one life - if you trip on an\nobstacle, you are captured and VM ends (it must then be re-lit by \"Escape\").\nOn the first VM wave, however, some settings give you an additional life (you\nresume the wave where you stumbled).  Completing \"Escape\" a second time does\nnot award any additional lives, just points.\n\nJumping over obstacles awards 5OK per hazard, and after several jumps,\nthe Doctor escapes to the Police Box (jumping into the Box awards a bonus 1M!),\nspotting an additional Doctor and awarding points for surviving (could be 1M?),\navoiding obstacles (additional 1OO-2OOK per obstacle), and not dying (another\n1M).  The \"not dying\" bonus is only given if you completed the wave the first\ntime through, so you never hit an obstacle.  The total bonus per wave is\nsomewhere near 6M (lower wave = lower value); it's a lot of points if you've\ngot a Playfield X, which you should always get before shooting for Video Mode.\nAlso, completing a wave (except for the final wave) re-lites Video Mode for the\nnext wave.\n\nIn addition, there is a \"Last Wave Bonus\" for completing all the waves\nin a Video Mode set - there are 4 waves in the first set, 5 in the second, 6 in\nthe third (7 in the 4th?).  The Last Wave Bonus is exactly equivalent to the\nsum of the Wave Bonuses received in the previous waves, so it isn't affected by\nthe Playfield X.  The Last Wave Bonus for the first 4 waves (all 4 waves at 4x)\nhas a maximum of 11OM.\n\nA full Video Mode set, which is lit by a relatively simple shot, can be\nworth up to, oh say 3OO million or so, and in addition, you get all those extra\nDoctors spotted.  Not bad for just jumpin' over stuff.\n\nFor those who are clueless, here's the patterns for the first four\nwaves (and so, the first entire set of waves) of VM (S = short jump, L = long\njump):\n\nWave 1: S S L L L L\nWave 2: S L L S S S S\nWave 3: S S S L L L S S S\nWave 4: L L S S L S L L L\n\nThese patterns are only valid if the machine is on standard settings;\non harder settings, VM waves are random.\n\nAn Extra Ball is almost always awarded as you jump over the last\nobstacle of Wave 2.  However, this is self-adjusting (or operator-settable),\nand sometimes appears at the end of Wave 3.  Check the Status Report for\ndetails...\n\nNever forget to jump into the Police Box... points is points.\n\nQuotes from Video Mode:\n\n\n\t\"Whew, that was a close one.\" -end of Wave 1 if you died once, also happens every so often.\n\t\"I don't mind the brisk pace, but a Dalek or two is an obstacle I can't face.\" -end of Wave 3; the wording for this quote is highly suspect.\n\t\"WHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\" \"THE DOCTOR HAS ESCAPED...\" zzzt... -as the Last\nWave Bonus is awarded; if you've never seen this, an Emperor Dalek destroys the\nSupreme Dalek who let the Doctor get away through the first set of Video Mode\nwaves.  Should you get to the second set (even funnier): \"WHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\"\nzzztt!... the Supreme Dalek destroys the Emperor Dalek in self-defense.\n\n\nDoctor #2\nAt first glance you might think Doctor 2 does absolutely nothing, and\nwhatever he does it can't be worth that much.  Bzzzt!  Not true not true... Doc\n2 does BOTH of the following (wow, both!):\n\n-gives you extra time to shoot the \"Hang-On\" score to the left; at the\noutset, it takes pretty much an immediate shot to score it.  Now you've got\nmore time, and you might be able to take a second crack at it.  Really, though,\nthere isn't much extra time to shoot it.\n\n-more importantly, Doc 2 doubles the score you do get from Hang-On.\n\nWHAT score?  Rarely can we even see the Hang-On getting scored, since\nthere's some mumbo jumbo animation going on (usually the Air Sneaker flying\naround in the middle of W-H-O).  Hang-On adds up pretty quickly even though we\ncan't see it... it begins at 25OK for the first hit, and goes up an additional\n25OK each additional hit.  While shooting W-H-O numerous times, the Hang-On\ngets scored every time, and these points add up... I've seen Hang-On scored (at\na 4X multiplier with Doc 2 lit) for nearly 4O million, not bad for a pretty\nsimple straight-on shot.  On later ROMs (L-1 etc.), the Hang-On has a maximum\nvalue of 2M (4M with the help of Doc 2), ending the possible super-high Hang-On\nscore.  The Hang-On value carries over throughout the game, so you\ncan just keep racking up the score (until the maximum).\n\nWhen Hang-On is not lit and you hit the target, you receive a\n\"Collision\" score, exactly equal to one-fifth the Hang-On score.  I'm not sure\nif Doc 2 has an effect on the Collision score; it probably doesn't, so with Doc\n2 lit, the Collision is worth one-tenth the Hang-On score.  The Collision score\nbegins at 2OK, and does not increase the Hang-On score.  Since the Hang-On\ncarries over, so does the Collision.\n\nDoctor #3\nDoctor #3 doesn't do very much... well sort of.  Doc 3 gives more time\nto shoot each letter in W-H-O, and that's it.  For some players this may mean\nabsolutely nothing; they can shoot the W-H-O flat-out on the go.  Sometimes\nhaving more time to shoot W-H-O can actually be annoying, because completing a\nW-H-O (by shooting the Loop Ramp) returns the ball to the left flipper and not\nthe top one.\n\nBut in general, having Doc 3 lit is pretty good though not wonderful,\nand it's gives you much more time to shoot each letter of W-H-O, nearly 7-1O\nseconds per letter.  This is especially important during a Sonic Boom round,\nsince it lasts just as long as the W-H-O timer.\n\nThe rules for shooting W-H-O are pretty simple... each letter is worth\nthe flashing value just below the Right Ramp, usually 2 or 3 million.  Once W\nis shot on the right ramp, the points are awarded and H is lit at the Hang-On\ntarget.  Shooting H scored the points again and lights the O at the Loop Ramp,\nand shooting W a second time (on later ROMs) scores the points again and resets\nthe timer.  Once H has been shot, a second shot at H (even though it isn't\nflashing) will award the points and reset the timer for the Loop Ramp.\nCompleting the set of three advances the value of each letter and brings the\nball back to the left flipper (expect for Sonic Boom circumstances, when it\ngoes to the top flipper) for a shot at another W-H-O.  A set number of them\nlights extra ball in the inlanes and outlanes... once the extra ball becomes\nlit, it can be collected immediately just by hitting the right flipper once\n(making the left inlane the lit target).  The number of W-H-Os to light the\nextra ball is almost always 2, then it depends on settings: I've seen one where\nthe 2nd EB was at 4 more W-H-Os, then 8 more, then 12, etc., and I've also seen\none where the 2nd EB was at 6 more W-H-Os, then 1O more, then 14... the number\nis displayed while W-H-O is being shot.\n\nBut in general, the rules Doc 3 changes are very simple and easy to\nunderstand.\n\nDoctor #4\nOn the other hand...\n\nDoctor #4 affects the \"Repair\" targets, which is most certainly the\nmost confusing part of the game.  What we DO know is that Doc 4 spots an extra\ntarget on \"Repair\"... what the targets actually score, especially when they're\nall complete, is a problem.  I think I finally figured it out:\n\n-whether Doc 4 is lit or not, the first five targets lit on \"Repair\"\nare worth 1OOK, 25OK, 5OOK, 75OK, and 1M.  If Doc 4 is lit, you'll get credit\nfor at one hit per shot to \"Repair\", usually two.  Once any Repair target is\nshot, it becomes solid, and all others will begin flashing.  If you don't hit\nanother after a few seconds, they flash faster then reset (like Stretch the\nTruth on Fish Tales).\n\n-when \"Repair\" is complete (all six targets hit), each additional hit\non \"Repair\" is worth 1M, with 5OK being added to this value at each hit - in\nother words, the second hit is 1,O5O,OOO, then 1,1OO,OOO, etc.  Doc 4 has a\ndifferent influence here: it doubles the score for each target, so they're 2M\nplus 1OOK/hit.  With 4X, hitting one target is worth up to 8 million.  Again,\nthere's a limited time before the targets reset themselves.\n\nOnce \"Repair\" is completed, you'll see two numbers on the animation:\nbelow the word, you'll see what the next target hit will be worth.  Above it,\nyou'll see a second, larger number above the word \"Repair\" - this is the total\nnumber of points you've racked up by shooting Repair targets.  It's especially\nnice to have Repair completed with Doc 4 lit during a multiball... with all the\nball-bouncing going on, it's easy to hit the Repair targets for up to 8M (with\nPlayfield X) apiece, and I've gotten the total Repair score at least all the\nway to 11O million.  Really, then, even though Doc 4 looks like he doesn't do\nanything, he can be worth a lot.\n\nHowever, you need to hit all six Repair targets before anything\nhappens.  This is extremely difficult without Doc 4's help, so it's usually\nnot worth trying for until Doc 4 is lit.\n\nThat's about it... one more thing: my friend Steve would like to point\nout at this time that Doctor #4 has a pretty cool hat.\n\nDoctor #5\nDoc 5 is probably the least important of the seven; all it does (at\nleast, all I can see that it does) is double how much each jet bumper is worth\nwhen the bumpers are hit.  Originally, the Jet Bumpers each add 5OK to the\nvalue of the Transmat target, and Transmat is lit when the value reaches 75OK.\nWhile bumpers are being hit, a circle is filled in, pie-chart style, on the\nbackglass... when Transmat is lit, this circle flashes instead.\n\nWith Doc 5 lit, each Jet Bumper is worth 1OOK for the Transmat; so you\nonly need 8 hits to get the Transmat lit for another doctor.\n\nUnlike previous reporting, Doc 5 doesn't affect the end-of-ball bonus,\nalthough any shot to the Jet Bumpers awards an additional bonus multiplier.\nThe multiplier carries over ball-to-ball and can go quite high (almost 4Ox).\nI've seen the bonus as high as 6M, so with the multiplier that's quite a bit.\nGiving a tilt warning when the bonus animation is supposed to be displayed\naborts the animation; I'm pretty sure it doesn't abort the bonus.\n\nAnd that's all... the only other good thing about Doc 5 is that in\nVideo Mode, his tie flaps while he runs...\n\nDoctor #6\nProbably the most important of all the Doctors, and his importance\nreally depends on your individual playing ability.  All Doc 6 does is spot an\nadditional Playfield X for each time the Loop Ramp is shot, and also lengthen\nthe amount of time that this multiplier stays lit.  With Doc 6 lit, it takes\nonly 3 shots to get the Playfield X at maximum (4X)... compare that to six\nshots under normal circumstances.\n\nThe Playfield X is crucial to producing high scores - for example, the\nhighest-scoring shot in Who is the Triple Davros jackpot, worth 3OO million.\nWith a 4X multiplier, it's 1.2 billion; just having the multiplier lit is worth\n9OO million points!  It takes a lot less work to get a replay if you can keep\nthe Playfield X up high.\n\nThe behavior of the Loop Ramp diverter is a bit confusing at times -\nsometimes the ball is fed back to the upper flipper, and sometimes it goes all\nthe way to the lower left flipper.  Here are the rules for that:\n\n-If the last loop made lights a Sonic Boom Round (i.e., 9, 19, etc.),\nthen the ball is fed back to the upper flipper, regardless of whether the loop\ncompleted a W-H-O or not.\n\n-If the Sonic Boom Round is shot -immediately- after it is lit (the\nshot for 1O, 2O loops etc. is made right after the previous loop shot), then\nthe ball is fed to the lower flipper to shoot W-H-O for Sonic Booms (each worth\n1OM).  If the shot is not made immediately (i.e., you miss then shoot it later)\nthen it follows the normal rules.\n\n-When the Loop Ramp is shot during the Sonic Boom Round, it awards a\nBoom, immediately ends the Boom Round, and returns the ball to the upper\nflipper.\n\n(note: this means that it's best to avoid shooting the Loop Ramp during\na Boom Round until the W and H shots have been scored... so if the ball is sent\nto the upper flipper, it's a good idea to just let it fall.)\n\n-Besides that, the Loop Ramp returns the ball to the bottom when it\ncompletes a W-H-O, and otherwise to the upper flipper for another ramp.\n\nPretty psychotic behavior, but oh well.  When shooting the Loop Ramp,\nit might seem like you're getting a lot of points - that guy's always yelling\n\"Million\" at you once the Playfield X is at 4X.  But one million on a game is\npretty paltry when the replay's at 3OO million or more... so the point is to\nget the Sonic Booms.  The series of shots (W-H-O, that is) is definitely worth\nmastering - in a Boom Round, they're usually worth a total of 12O million, and\nthey also contribute to getting Extra Balls.\n\nDoctor #7\nLike it says when he gets selected, Doc 7 helps with multiball (or\nMultiball or Multi-Ball or Multi-ball or whatever).  Actually that's not quite\nright, Doc 7 helps to get TO multiball.  Here's how to get to Multiball:\n\n-Start in Lock Mode.  For the first multiball, the locks begin lit;\nfor subsequent multiballs, you need to hit the target between the locks.  If a\nball is already in a lock (shot in by another player), the target also gives\nyou credit for that lock.  If another player's ball is in one lock, and you\nshoot the other, you get credit for your lock and the other player's ball is\nshot back out.  If Doc 7 is lit, hitting the target also awards a Time Factor\nfor Target Mode (more on that later).\n\nSomething to point out here is that any time a ball is shot out of a\nlock (or, with some ROMs, the lock target is shot), the Second Chance (ball\nsave) is available for 2-3 seconds, even though it isn't flashing (it flashes\nat the start of a ball for 5-1O secs).  The locks tend to kick balls right down\nthe center drain, and it's a good idea to just let them go rather than flailing\nat them.  Second Chance is also awarded the few times a successful ramp shot\nreturns the ball to the outlane, a nice feature to avoid angry tilts.\n\nAny lock you make is held over to the next ball, even if another player\nemptied the locks through multiball - in that case, there would only be one\nball in the locks when the Expander raises to Target Mode (see below).\n\nWhen a lock is registered, the backglass animation shows Doc 7 and his\nfemale partner Ace at two consoles (Ace at left).  An appropriate sound effect\nplays depending on which of the two locks was made first.\n\nAnother note about Lock Mode: in a multi-player game, it can be very\ndifficult to score locks if another player has put balls in them to start.\nThe target between the locks is small, and hitting a ball into a hole where a\nball is already locked has a good shot at a center drain with no Second Chance.\nSo try to go first. :)\n\n-Once two locks have been made (the backglass will show 2 \"consoles\"),\nthe Time Expander raises to Target Mode, which looks remarkably like Pinbot.\nTo finish Target Mode and start Multiball, each of the five circular targets\nmust be hit 3 times - each hit brings down the \"Time Expansion Factor\" (which\nis announced each time it changes), and a flashing light below the target\nbecomes solid.  In the first multiball, hitting between two targets can\nregister up to three hits, two for the target hit most solidly and one for the\nneighboring target.  In subsequent multiballs, only one hit can be made on a\ntarget each time the Expander is hit.\n\nDoc 7 has great importance here - anytime the set of targets is hit,\nDoc 7 spots an additional target, specifically the one that still needs the\nmost hits.  This makes Target Mode much easier... for example, without Doc 7,\nyou'd have to hit one specific target once you get to Factor 1.  But with Doc 7\nlit, you can hit any target and spot the final unlit one.\n\nSince Doc 7 has such an advantage in Target Mode, you should make sure\nhe is lit when you get to this point.  You can change the current Doctor when\na ball is put in play - if Doc 7 is unlit before the start of Target Mode, make\nhim the current doctor.\n\nShould you happen to drain during Target Mode, the targets you hit are\nheld over to the next ball.  If another player gets multiball while you are in\nTarget Mode, you remain there - when you begin multiball yourself, the other\nballs will come from the auto-plunger.\n\n-Once Target Mode is completed, the Expander raises again to reveal\nthree gates, each with a picture of a Dalek on it.  The backglass shows which\nDalek level multiball will start at for each gate shot - for the first\nmultiball (with local settings - your mileage may vary), these gates are\nSupreme/Emperor/Supreme.  In general, the middle gate is one level higher than\nthe outer gates.\n\nMultiball is worth a LOT of points, and it's very important to get a\ngood Playfield X before starting multiball - after all, what good is a 45M\njackpot when it could have been 18OM?  So shoot for the Loop Ramp before\nshooting for the gates.\n\n-Once a gate is shot, the Expander lowers to kick out any locked balls,\nthen raises back to the Dalek gates - finally, multiball!  The goal of\nmultiball is to shoot a ball through each of the three gates, and accomplishing\nthis awards a Jackpot.  After scoring a Jackpot (until the Davros round), the\nExpander briefly lowers to Target Mode as the gates are reset, then raises\nagain to set up the Daleks for the next Jackpot.  There are several levels of\nDaleks... these are all I know, there are probably others at lower point\nvalues.\n\n\n\t(??) Bronze Daleks = 3OM\n\tSilver Daleks = 35M\n\tGold Daleks = 4OM\n\tSupreme Daleks = 45M\n\tEmperor Daleks = 5OM\n\n\nSome Jackpots will prompt the best quote in the game: \"Dalek in the\ncorner pocket.\"\n\nEach level of Daleks will remain lit as long as a gate is shot within\na time limit (about 1O-15 secs); it doesn't count if you shoot a gate that has\nalready been hit.  If no gate is shot (or if you drain from 3-ball to 2-ball\nmultiball), the Dalek level will drop by one - Supreme Daleks will become Gold\nDaleks, for example.  This is also true for Davros, and it's very annoying to\nhave Davros change into a plain old Emperor Dalek.\n\nOn newer ROMs, the Status Report tells you how many Jackpots you need\nto reach the Davros round - you'll see \"3-ball Daleks at xxM - x more for\nDavros\" and the same for 2-ball Daleks.  It always takes one more 2-ball\nJackpot than 3-ball.  Initially, it takes 2 Jackpots with 3-ball multiball, and\n3 Jackpots with 2 balls.  Shooting the center gate at the start of multiball\nreduces these numbers by one automatically.  (Confusing?)  Just remember that\n2-ball multiball is one level lower than 3-ball, and the levels get higher as\nyou score Jackpots.\n\nScoring a Jackpot on Emperor Daleks lights all 7 doctors and sets up\nthe Davros Super Jackpot - this means it takes one fewer Jackpot to get to\nDavros if you shoot the center gate at the beginning.  After the Emperor Daleks\nare finished, the Expander lowers back to Target Mode, as Davros announces\n\"Let's see if you can break my personal force field, Doctor\"... as before, each\ntarget must be hit, but this time only one hit is required.  Also, Doc 7 will\nNOT help - you need to hit each target in earnest.  Once all 5 targets are hit,\nthe gates come up again, and shooting all three within the time scores 1OOM!\nIf you can do this, it's a big feat...\n\nAfter collecting Davros, the \"Double Davros\" round begins; it's exactly\nsimilar to the original Davros round, only TWO hits are required on the\nExpander targets to bring up the gates.  Double Davros Jackpot is 2OOM!  And\nTriple Davros, where 3 hits are required on the targets, is worth (good guess)\n3OO million, not bad.  Not bad at all.  There is no \"Quadruple Davros\" - the\nTriple Davros repeats itself.  In all 3 Davros rounds, taking too much time to\nshoot the gates, or having a third ball drain results in Davros changing into\nEmperor Daleks.\n\nSo the Jackpots sure can add up - going from Supreme Daleks to just\nsingle Davros is worth 195M, almost 8OO million with the Playfield X.  In\naddition, the next multiball (unless you scored a Davros) will pick up where\nyou left off - if you ended the first multiball with Davros lit, the next one\nbegins with Davros lit at all three gates!  Tough to miss that shot...\n\nSomething else to point out - if you are unable to score any Jackpot\nduring the multiball, you have the possibility of re-locking the balls to\nrestart multiball.  If no Jackpot is scored, the Expander goes back to Lock\nMode, and Re-Lock is lit for 15 secs (2O if Doc 7 is lit).  In addition, an\nextra 1O secs is given for shooting the target between the locks, or for\nlocking the first ball.  If no ball is locked within the time, then the game\ncontinues in single-ball play.  If only one ball is locked, a second ball is\nauto-plunged immediately.  If this drains, the other ball kicks out for single-\nball play again.  If you can't lock the ball in time (and there's plenty of\ntime), the other ball is kicked out for a 2-ball multiball, and the Dalek level\npicks up where you left off at the end of the original multiball.  If both are\nlocked, 3-ball multiball restarts.  In either case, multiball restarts\nimmediately; no targets or gates to shoot.  Of course, remember to jack up the\nPlayfield X before starting multiball.\n\nA final word about multiball - the Davros Jackpot is VERY difficult to\nscore (since the Expander targets are good drain shots), and actually, the\nnormal Dalek Jackpots aren't all that hard to get.  So unless you think you can\nget more than one Davros, it may be better NOT to shoot for the center gate at\nfirst, and to get as many Dalek Jackpots as possible... that's what I've had\nthe most success doing, and my best game (2.4B) had no Davros Jackpot.\n\nQuestions and Answers and other Stuff that isn't all that important...\nQ: Why are there 7 Doctors?  Why not 12 or 5 or something?\n\nA: Each of the 7 Doctors, whose pictures are displayed on the\nbackglass, the playfield, and the dot display, represent a portrait of all\nseven actors who have portrayed Doctor Who in its 26-year run on the BBC from\n1963 to 1989.  There can be more than one Doctor Who because he is a Time Lord,\nand has the power to regenerate into a new body (also a great way to resolve\ncontract disputes at the network!).  The 7 portraits are in chronological\norder, and the men who portrayed Doctor Who are:\n\n\n\tDoc 1: William Hartnell (oops, not Richard)\n\tDoc 2: Patrick Troughton (a fine-looking gentleman indeed :)\n\tDoc 3: Jon Pertwee\n\tDoc 4: Tom Baker\n\tDoc 5: Pater Davison\n\tDoc 6: Colin Baker\n\tDoc 7: Sylvester McCoy\n\n\nAlso, if you look closely at the area each Doctor occupies on the\nplayfield, there may be one (or several) other figures: they all played major\nparts in the show as well.\n\nQ. What's that thing that goes inside a Dalek (seen on the loop ramp\nMillion as well as the Last Wave of Video Mode)?\n\nA. It's a mutated humanoid, yup!  They're called \"Kaleds\", and a\nnuclear war on their planet mutated them.  Davros offered to help the dying\nKaleds, building a \"life support system\" for them (the Dalek shell).  But...\nDavros genetically fixed the Kaleds to have his ego and no conscience, oh well.\nBy the way \"Dalek\" is an anagram of \"Kaled\"...\n\nQ. What's that airplane/hovercraft/spacecraft/sneaker that flies all\nover the place during W-H-O???\n\nA. Yay, we figured this one out!!  It's the \"Who Mobile\", which was\ndriven/piloted by Doc 3 in the series, sometime during the early 197Os.  Yes, a\nlow-budget sci-fi show like Dr. Who had enough money for this sort of special\neffect - actually, the Who Mobile looks a LOT better in the game than on the TV\nshow.\n\nQ. What should I do to get lots of points on this game?\n\nA. Hmmm... tough call, since even though the scoring on Dr. Who is\nimbalanced, it's imbalanced in many ways, so there are many shots which will\ngive you too many points.\n\nIt's important to learn to shoot all three of W-H-O in rapid\nsuccession (without missing, that is), since 2 W-H-Os is worth an Extra Ball,\nand your Sonic Boom score depends almost solely on shooting these shots.  The\nSonic Boom is worth a lot, and if you can pull it off perfectly, the ball is\nreturned for Loop Shots - 1O in a row for another Sonic Boom.  Repeat and win\nbig time.\n\nThe best starting strategy is to go with Doc 1, and begin pounding away\nat the Escape targets.  Since you'll probably get 2 per shot at it, only a few\nshots lights Video Mode, which can get you upwards of 2OOM.  Never shoot Video\nMode without a good Playfield X, though - actually, never shoot anything good\nwithout a Playfield X.\n\nAfter Doc 1, it's useful to prioritize the Doctors according to what\nthey do... after Video Mode is lit, Doc 1 is nearly useless, and since the\nDoctor can be changed after a lock, change it if VM is lit.  Doc 6 is the most\nimportant otherwise, since the Playfield X is so important to score.  After\nthat, Doc 3 is effective for score and extra balls, then Doc 2 for score on\nHang-On, then 4, then 5 (nearly useless).  Doc 7 is the exception: he's totally\nuseless unless you have Target Mode, then he's essential.  So the order is:\n\n1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 5  with 7 abstaining.\n\nJackpots, though they give wonderful sound effects and big points at\nonce, are largely overrated.  Sure, sure, 2OO million for one shot, but setting\nthat one shot up takes a LONG time.  It's worth going for, but usually it's\nbetter to let the locks go, getting them on accident, then selecting Doc 7 to\ngo for the multiball.\n\nAnd that's about it - don't forget the big points from Hang-On and the\nRepair targets, but Video Mode, Multiball, and the Playfield X are the ways to\ngo.\n\nQ. What's that \"moo\"?\n\nA. It's not exactly certain how you get the Cow to show up.  What does\nhappen is that the Transmat target must be shot with not enough bumper hits to\nTransmat a Doctor.  Instead of seeing a Doctor on the backglass, there's a\nportrait of a cow (supposedly wearing a hat, I've never seen it).  Most of the\ntime when it happens, it's either during a Sonic Boom round or when the round\nis lit, but at least once, it's happened just randomly.  Go figure.\n\nQ. What does the Dr. Who manual have to say about all this?\n\nA. Well here's the \"Game Story\" which serves to explain where all these\nDoctors are and what they're doing:\n\n------ (begin unnecessary story)\n\nTime is running out, literally...\n\nThe Master is back and this time he will not fail!  He has recruited Davros\nand what is left of his desperate Daleks.  Since being beaten by the\nMovellans, this group of Daleks have nothing to lose.  And both have\none enemy in common...the Doctor.\n\nThe Master has found an ancient Gallifrey Laboratory equipped with an\neverlasting self-regenerating \"Time Expander\".  This \"Time Expander\" can\ntake any part of time and space, stretch it, then allow all other space\nand time events to interact with this new time stream.  This machine\nrequires two operators to work together (changing time and space is\nserious business).  Of course, this has never stopped the Master, or\neven Davros.\n\nThe problem of finding all seven Doctors and expanding their time\nstreams is easily solved in one word-- Earth!  This is the Doctors\nfavorite planet.  All of his regenerations, past, present, and even\nfuture, have or will, arrive upon Earth.  All that has to be done is\nto expand Earth's time and push all the Doctors into the final nova\nof the Earth's Sun.  At game start, you can experience the time\nexpansion of Earth by observing the continental drift back to the\npast (over 300 million years ago!).\n\nBut everything has not gone as planned.  All of the Doctors, aware of\ntime being expanded, have escaped.  However, not everyone is safe.  The\nfirst Doctor has escaped to a planet and is being bombarded by the\nMaster's \"borrowed and enhanced\" Roni spheres.  The second Doctor is\nlost in a land mine of black holes in space and is trying to dodge\ndestruction (the black holes are rumored to power the Time\nExpander).  The third Doctor is trapped in the Whomobile.  The\nfourth Doctor is stranded somewhere to repair his TARDIS from old\nunreliable force field projectors.  The fifth Doctor, transmatted\naway from Earth is, unfortunately, held prisoner in a never ending\ntransmat web.  The sixth Doctor was jettisoned to a mountainous\nDalek planet, where the time expanded rebirth of the Dalek race is\nabout to begin.  Last, but not least, the seventh Doctor is much\nmore fortunate.  He escaped unharmed and has found the Time\nExpander.  Now the challenge is to restore Earth's Time to normal,\nconfront the Master and his traps, the Daleks, and of course Davros\n(the creator of the Daleks).\n\nWhen it is time for the ultimate battle with Davros, all the\nDoctors will be re-united, combining their unique knowledge and\nexperience to defeat Davros and his Daleks.\n\n------ (end unnecessary story - if this needs a copyright, Bally wrote it.)\n\nQ.

Wash Dracula's Car.\n\n\nImportant Things\n\n\n\nThis is a glossary of the shots and features that will be referred to during\nthe discussion of the game.  Some of the shots have names which are less than\nobvious; I'll try to provide and use more obvious names instead.\n\n Plunger\n This is an automatic plunger.  It is used not only to launch balls\ninto play, but also to automatically relock balls as the game sees fit,\nwhich it does by lifting the Plunger Lane ramp and firing balls into the\nchannel beneath.\n Right Orbit\n This is a half-orbit in the upper right corner of the\nplayfield.  Balls are launched into play along this path.  There are five\nlights here, each for a letter in V-I-D-E-O.\n Drop Target\n This is placed at the end of the Right Orbit, in the upper left\ncorner of the playfield, just past the Rollover Lanes.\n Top Sinkhole\n This Sinkhole is hidden behind the Drop Target.  When Video\nMode is lit, the Drop Target is lowered and the ball can enter the\nSinkhole to start Video Mode.  Afterwards, the ball is kicked out of\nthe Asylum.\n Rollover Lanes\n These three lanes can have their lights steered by the\nflippers, with the object being to light all three lanes.  The right\nflipper steers right, and the left flipper steers left.  Unlit lanes are\nflashing at the beginning of each ball, after shooting the Right Orbit,\nand a few other times at random, just to mess with your head.\n Jet Bumpers\n These are three Jet Bumpers directly beneath the Rollover\nLanes.  They are arranged in the usual triangular fashion.\n Coffin Ramp\n This is a short-entrance ramp between the Jet Bumpers and the\nRight Orbit; it returns to the Left Inlane.  This Ramp has a long shallow\nsection before its trigger, but usually, getting past the entrance and the\nfirst turn is sufficient to send the ball all the way around.\n Coffin\n When the Coffin Ramp is raised, balls can enter a sinkhole in the\nCoffin beneath it.  Balls \"locked\"\nhere are released through a habitrail\nonto the playfield right in the middle of the Jet Bumpers.\n Plastic Coffin\n This is a molded plastic coffin atop the Coffin Ramp, which\ncontains what is probably supposed to be Dracula.  At least they didn't\nput a plastic fish atop the backglass.  Note that there are two lights\natop the coffin, indicating how many balls have been\n\"locked\" here.\n Altar\n This is an eject hole above the Right Inlane, aimed towards the right\nflipper.  This is also known as the Dungeon or the Rat Hole.\n Tunnel\n This is a sinkhole above and to the left of the Jet Bumpers.  It\nreturns the ball to the Left Inlane.  There are four lights here: Mystery\nAward, Mist Multiball, Extra Ball, and Castle Jackpot.\n Bank Targets\n These are two banks of three targets each.  The center target\nis red, and the others are yellow.  One bank is directly below the Jet\nBumpers, facing down and slightly to the right.  The other is at the far\nleft side of the playfield, facing right.  There is a light in front of\neach target, indicating its status: flashing for available, lit for\nspotted, or unlit for unavailable (only applies to center target, which\nmust be hit last).\n Asylum\n This is a small catch lane just above the left set of Bank Targets.\nYou can't really shoot for it, but there's little reason to do so.\n Castle Ramp\n This is also known as the Left Ramp, the Main Ramp, or the\nCemetery Ramp.  It's a long ramp which begins in the upper left corner of\nthe playfield, just above the Asylum, and doesn't really peak until the\nback right corner of the machine.  It can lock balls by diverting them\ninto the Castle Lane; otherwise, it returns balls to the Right Inlane.\nThe light at the entrance to the Left Ramp indicates that a Castle Lock\nis available.  The green light on the backplane of the cabinet indicates\nthat the diverter is active (for a Castle Lock or Bats).\n Castle Lane\n This is the habitrail running above the playfield from the\ncenter of the Castle Ramp to the Plunger Lane.  It usually only holds one\nball, but during Castle Multiball, may hold as many as three.\n Mist Lane\n This is the path that a ball takes at the beginning of Mist\nMultiball.  It runs from a gate at the lower left side of the playfield,\nabove the Left Slingshot, across the playfield and upwards to a gate\njust above the Altar.  There is a motorized magnet beneath the playfield\nto carry the ball along this path, and small lights to illuminate its\ntravel.  A modulated 40KHz infrared beam is transmitted along this path,\nin order to determine if the ball is still on the magnet.  The ball may\ntravel in either direction, depending on where it happens to be when the\nmode starts.  It will be at the right end of the Lane unless the last\nattempt at Mist Multiball failed.\n Outlanes\n The Right Outlane has an orange light for Special, and the Left\nOutlane a red light for Extra Ball.  The colors are contrary to tradition,\nwhich demands that Specials be red and Extra Balls orange.\n Inlanes\n The Right Inlane temporarily lights the Tunnel for Mystery Award,\nand the Left Inlane lights the Coffin or Coffin Ramp for\n2X.  The posts\ndividing the Inlanes and Outlanes have rubber.\n Slingshots\n These are the usual.\n Flippers\n These are two Fliptronic II (ie, Williams-style Solid State)\nflippers in the usual locations.  These are typically the new lightning\nbolt shorter flippers in production machines.\n D-R-A-C-U-L-A\n These seven yellow lights are lightning bolts in the middle of the\nplayfield.  They represent progress towards Coffin Jackpots.\n Multiball Lights\n These three lights (typically purple) indicate which\nMultiball modes are active: Coffin, Castle, and Mist.\n 2X and 3X Lights\n These lights (typically green) indicate the current\nJackpot multiplier, which is determined by how many Multiball modes are\nrunning.\n Shoot Again\n This orange light indicates that you have an Extra Ball.\n Love Never Dies\n This yellow light represents the \"ball saver\" feature.\nWhile it is lit (or during the grace period), a side or center drain will\nrelaunch the ball into play with no penalty.  It is normally lit for a\nshort while at the beginning of each ball.  It is also active for a while\nat the beginning of each Multiball mode, and for the Left Outlane briefly\nafter an Altar kickout (although the light will not come on).\n Playfield\n Hardcoat.  Develops a nice divot where the ball lands after\nbeing fired from the autoplunger.\n Balls\n Four steel balls should be installed in Dracula.\n\n\n\nSkill Shot\n\n\n\nThe Skill Shot is purely a matter of\ntiming.  The display will show a three-faced\ngargoyle, with each face flashing in turn.  When the ball hits the Drop\nTarget after being launched, the Skill Shot award depends on the face which\nis lit.  The left face awards 100K,\nand the right face awards 500K.  The\ncenter face awards 1M the first time,\nincreasing by 1M each subsequent time\nto a maximum of 5M.  The center face also spots a\nV-I-D-E-O letter (see Video Mode)\nand advances the Coffin Ramp if the Coffin is not already open.\nAfter a successful Skill Shot, subsequent Skill Shots are slightly faster.\nThe game favours the center face slightly, awarding it if the face has just\nchanged to 100K or was just about to change from\n500K.\n\nIf the ball misses the Drop Target, the faces continue flashing, and the\nfirst sensor hit will award the lit face.  Unfortunately, this is little more\nthan blind luck.\n\nIf you press the autoplunger button while a ball is not in the lane (the game\nis still trying to kick it out), the game may then launch the ball as soon as\nit does get the ball into the lane, effectively ruining your Skill Shot.  It\nmay also decide that it wants to lock a ball, and you have no way of knowing\nthis until you wait to make sure it doesn't raise the Plunger Ramp.\n\nIf you start a game and there are somehow no balls in the trough, none will\nbe supplied to the plunger lane, only one ball search will be performed, and\nnothing except power cycling the machine (and thereby losing your credit)\nwill get the balls in the correct locations.  Check the trough before\nstarting a game!\n\nDue to the way the ball goes up the lane and jumps onto the playfield, the\ntiming of the Skill Shot may be inconsistent.\n\n\nRollover Lanes\n\n\n\nThe lights on these lanes are steered in both directions by the flippers.\nExactly how the machine behaves when you light all three lanes depends on\nthe ROM revision.  Newer ROMs advance the Bonus Multiplier by one factor\neach time you complete the lanes, to a maximum of\n10X, and the Bonus\nMultiplier is automatically held from ball to ball.  On older ROMs, the Bonus\nMultiplier proceeds\n2X,\n4X,\n6X,\n8X,\nand 10X,\nand it is not held over to\nsubsequent balls.  Completing the lanes after reaching\n10X always awards\n5M, although it looks like\n6M because of the blood-dripping font (this may have\nbeen different on early ROMs).\n\n\nMystery Award\n\n\n\nOn Extra Easy settings, the Tunnel is lit for a Mystery Award at the\nbeginning of each ball.  On Extra Hard settings, the Tunnel is only lit by\nrolling through the Right Inlane.  Otherwise, the Tunnel is lit once at the\nbeginning of the game.  The Tunnel can be lit for a Mystery Award by rolling\nthrough the Right Inlane (almost any time); however, it will time out (8-10\nseconds on Easy and Extra Easy, 5 seconds otherwise).\n\nMystery Awards are:\n\n Light Castle Lock\n Light Coffin Lock\n Light Video Mode (completes V-I-D-E-O)\n Advance Bonus X\n Extra Ball\n Mystery Score\n(100K to\n5M or\n20M)\n\nThe first four awards are based on operator-adjustable percentages, and the\nExtra Ball award is used as part of the Extra Ball percentage reflexing.  No\nother awards are possible.\n\nThe Castle Lock that is lit by the Mystery Award does not time out, unlike\nregular Castle Locks.  Light Coffin Lock will not be awarded if the Coffin is\nalready open, but Light Castle Lock may be awarded if a Castle Lock is\nalready lit.  This can actually be helpful.\n\nOn newer ROMs, the Mystery Score can be 10M,\n15M, or 20M, but\notherwise, the awards are in the 100K to\n5M range, including such options as\n750K,\n1M,\n4M, etc.  The Mystery Score can\nnot be disabled, even in Tournament Mode.\n\n\nCastle Ramp\n\n\n\nThis is a rather difficult ramp.  The number of times you hit it over the\ncourse of your game is counted, and certain awards occur at certain\nintervals.  The game also tracks this value for Loop Champion, much like Dr.\nWho.  In fact, shots on this Ramp are called Loops.  Unlike Dr. Who, however,\nthe machine does not become confused at 100 Loops.  It will properly\nrecognize and remember Loop counts and Champions in excess of 100 Loops.  In\nfact, it will properly handle Loop counts in excess of 255!\n\nLoops are worth 1M, but consecutive Loops are worth\n5M.  Whoopee.\n\nThe typical sequence of awards from the Castle Ramp is:\n\n Bats at 3\n Mist Multiball Lit at 5\n Bonus at 6\n Extra Ball Lit at reflexed intervals\n\nThese awards are repeated at certain operator-settable intervals, and those\nintervals are usually an additional 10 for each award.  Detailed information\non how many Castle Ramp shots are required for each of the next awards is\navailable in the Status Report (catch the ball and wait), and the next award\nis indicated when you shoot the Castle Ramp, unless that shot awards\nsomething, in which case that is displayed instead.  The Bonus award comes\nmore frequently, usually at multiples of 6 Loops.\n\nThe Extra Ball is lit at various intervals, which are adjusted according to\nthe desired and actual Extra Ball percentages.  These adjustments are not\nalways by small amounts.\n\nThe Bonus alternates between lighting the Castle Lock (subject to the usual\ntime-out) and advancing the Coffin Ramp by one step.  The first Bonus is to\nlight the Castle Lock.  If the Coffin is already open or Coffin Multiball is\nrunning when the Bonus would advance the Coffin, a Castle Lock will be lit\ninstead.  If a Castle Lock is already lit when the Bonus would light a Castle\nLock, the Coffin will be advanced instead.  If neither is possible when you\nreach the Bonus, nothing is awarded.  Regardless of whether or not the Coffin\nis open, if the next Loop would award a Bonus of Light Castle Lock and you\nhave a Castle Lock already lit when you shoot that Loop, the game will not\nlight another Castle Lock for you, even though the shot you made used up the\ncurrently lit Castle Lock.\n\nWhen an Extra Ball is lit, shoot the Tunnel to collect it.  Extra Balls can\nbe stacked on the Tunnel with no apparent limit.  Factory settings probably\nlimit you to actually having 4 Extra Balls at any one time, however.  Since\nit's very difficult to get more than six or seven Extra Balls on Dracula,\nthis doesn't really matter.\n\nA weak shot up the Castle Ramp which falls into the Castle Lane even though\nthe Castle Lock is not lit will trigger an animation and award an additional\n5M for the Secret Passage.\nThis also counts as a Loop.  The ball will then\nbe fed to the Plunger Lane and autolaunched.\n\nSee also Mist Multiball\nand Castle Multiball.\n\n\nBats\n\n\n\nThe Bats sequence is triggered by the appropriate number of Castle Ramp\nshots.  When started, the ball will be diverted to the Castle Lane, then fed\nto the Plunger Lane and autolaunched back into play.  In Bats mode, you have\na certain amount of time (typically 15 seconds) to scare away a certain\nnumber of bats (typically 15 of them).  The faster you do this, the higher\nyour awarded Bats Bonus will be.  The Bonus begins at\n50M and counts down towards 2M,\nwhich is the minimum possible award if you do in fact complete the sequence.\nEvery switch you trip scares away one bat.  The value stays at\n50M for a\nwhile before counting down.  The value does not appear to count down at an\neven rate.  It counts down faster and faster as time progresses, which is a\nbit unreasonable.  On the bright side, hitting the Drop Target after the\nplunger launch scares away a bat, but does not start the timer.\n\nShooting the Right Orbit during Bats will suspend the countdown until the\nball hits another target, except the Drop Target, which will scare away a\nbat but not restart the countdown.\n\nThe Bats Bonus is subject to the Multi-Multiball Jackpot Multiplier that is\nin effect when the Bats mode begins.  A single Bats Bonus can therefore be\nas high as 150M.\n\nIf you do not manage to scare away all of the bats, you get no Bats Bonus.\n\nIf you scare away all the bats almost immediately - for example, if you\nstart Castle Multiball by hitting the Castle Ramp with Bats lit - you will\nsometimes receive a Bats Bonus of slightly\nmore than the initial 50M\ncountdown.  And I do mean slightly.\nValues I have seen are 50,000,240 and\n50,007,140.\n\nThe outlane switches scare away three bats at once.  This is one of the few\ntimes Dracula is kind to you.\n\nIf you make a Death Save or Bang Back, the timer will be suspended until the\nball trips a switch.\n\nThe Bats Bonus is carried over between balls, and awarded at the end of every\nball.  This can add up quite nicely if you get Bats during Multiball on your\nfirst ball.  Otherwise, the minimum\n2M is a joke.\n\n\nAltar\n\n\n\nThe number of times you shoot this kickout hole over the course of your game\nis counted, and certain awards occur at certain intervals.  There are only\ntwo such awards:\n\n Rats\n Outlanes Lit\n\nThe Rats sequence typically starts at the 3rd Altar, and each 5th Altar\nthereafter (these values are operator adjustable).  Outlanes are usually lit\nat 15 Altars (10 on Extra Easy, 20-25 on Hard and Extra Hard), and never\nagain thereafter.\n\nAfter the ball is kicked out of the Altar, Love Never Dies is active only for\nthe Left Outlane, briefly.  Unfortunately, a bad bounce can still cause a\ncenter drain.  The ball should\nmove past the right Slingshot without being\nhit by it, to land safely on the right flipper.\n\n\nRats\n\n\n\nThe Rats sequence is started by the appropriate number of Altar shots.  In\nthis sequence, you have a certain amount of time (typically 15 seconds) to\ndestroy a certain number of rats (typically 15 of them).  Every switch\ntripped destroys one rat.  The value of each rat is something like\n500K,\nplus\n50K for each subsequent Rat.\nUnfortunately, this formula gives a total that is 500K\nshort of the usual\n13,250,000.  The only explanation I can come up with is\nthat there may be a 500K bonus for completing Rats.\n\nWhat happens when you have destroyed all rats depends on your current mode\nand your ROM revision.  On prototype ROMs, you can (as best I could figure)\nalways continue to destroy Rats for more points (a reasonably valuable frenzy\nmode).  On newer ROMs (L-1),\nthis does not happen.  However, if you are in\nMulti-Multiball, the Rats are worth considerably more, because the value of\neach rat is subject to the current Multi-Multiball Jackpot Multiplier, and\nthe value of the next rat is increased by some other factor than\n50K.  I have\nhad a 100M\nRats Bonus on P-11 ROMs,\nwithout Multiball.  If you do not have\nthis additional frenzy, 15 rats are always worth exactly\n13,250,000 in Rats\nBonus.  Rats Bonuses during Multiball on newer ROMs are usually at least\n100M.\n\nIf you do not manage to destroy all of the rats, you get no Rats Bonus.\n\nThe outlane switches destroy three rats at once.  This is one of the few\ntimes Dracula is kind to you.\n\nIf you make a Death Save or Bang Back, the timer will be suspended until the\nball trips a switch.\n\nThe Rats Bonus is carried over between balls, and awarded at the end of every\nball.  This can add up nicely if you get Rats during a Multi-Multiball on\nyour first ball.\n\n\nCastle Multiball\n\n\n\nCastle Locks are lit by the appropriate number of Castle Ramp shots, by\ncompleting one of the sets of Bank Targets, or by a random award from the\nMystery Tunnel.  A set of Bank Targets is completed by hitting the two outer\ntargets (in any order) and then hitting the center target.  The Castle Lock\nis on the Castle Ramp, and it times out (in 13 seconds on normal settings, 20\non Extra Easy, 10 on Extra Hard).\n\nYou must lock three balls in order to start Castle Multiball.  When you do\nso, three balls are launched into play.  If you already have other Multiball\nmodes running, all four balls should be launched into play.\n\nDuring Castle Multiball, relocking one ball on the Castle Ramp will light the\nCastle Jackpot on the Tunnel.  The Castle Jackpot value starts at\n20M, and is\nincreased by\n100K for each Jet Bumper hit for a while after completing the\nRollover Lanes in normal play, or by slightly more for each Jet Bumper hit\nwhile the Castle Jackpot itself is lit during Castle Multiball.  On prototype\nmachines, the Castle Jackpot values are fixed at\n20M, 40M, etc, and I am not\nsure how the value is changed.  When the Castle Jackpot is lit, shoot the\nTunnel to collect it.  The Castle Jackpot times out after 20 seconds.\n\nIf there are three or more balls in play, you can relock a second ball on the\nCastle Ramp to light the Double Castle Jackpot, although the Castle Lock\nlight may not be lit to indicate this.  Relocking the second ball effectively\ndoubles the Castle Jackpot value, keeps two balls safely out of play, and\nrestarts the Castle Jackpot timer at 20 seconds.\n\nThe timer on the Jackpot or Double Jackpot does not start until a target is\nhit.  This is important when there is a ball stuck somewhere.  The Ball\nSearches will begin even before the timer starts to count down.\n\nWhen you collect a Castle Jackpot, its base value resets to the next higher\nmultiple of 20M,\nto a maximum of 80M\n(although the manual says it can reach\n100M, it does not do so on L-1\nROMs and newer).  This allows for a maximum\nCastle Jackpot of 480M\nplus change (3X Multi-Multiball, Double Jackpot).\n\nWhen the Castle Jackpot times out or you collect it, the locked ball(s) are\nreleased by autolaunching from the plunger lane.  Note that you cannot lock\na second ball for the Double Jackpot if there are only two balls in play.\n\nDuring Castle Multiball, completing the Bank Targets again will award some\nsort of Carriage Bonus (with its own animation and cool sound), which is\nusually in the 1-5M\nrange, by multiples of 500K.  I do not know what advances\nthis, and I don't recommend shooting for it anyhow.  The Carriage Bonus is\nsubject to the Multi-Multiball Jackpot Multiplier, for a maximum value of\n15M.\n\nDuring Castle Multiball, the Castle Jackpot light on the Tunnel will flicker\nfaintly all the time, even when the Castle Jackpot is not lit.  It should\nactually strobe brightly when the Castle Jackpot is lit.\n\nCastle Multiball should be a three-ball multiball, although the machine will\nsometimes only deliver two balls, or will sometimes deliver three and end\nMultiball when any one ball drains.\n\nWhen Castle Multiball begins, Love Never Dies is active briefly.\n\n\nMist Multiball\n\n\n\n\n\"Here's a killer feature!\" - promotional flyer\n\nMist Multiball is lit by the appropriate number of Castle Ramp shots.\nTrigger Mist Multiball by shooting the Tunnel when it is lit.  A ball will\nslowly cross the playfield along the Mist Lane.  Another ball will be fed to\nthe Left Inlane.  To actually start Mist Multiball, use this ball to knock\nthe other ball free of the magnet's control (be careful not to just swap\nyour ball for the Mist Lane ball).  Normally, the ball will start at the\nright end of the Mist Lane and proceed to the left.  However, if Mist\nMultiball has been recently attempted and missed, the ball will still be\nsitting in the left gate, and will proceed in reverse (note that this is\nmuch easier to hit, in my opinion).\n\nDuring Mist Multiball, all significant shots in the game are worth a Mist\nJackpot of 10M,\nand the game tries to call out all of your awards, although\nit sometimes lags behind.  These awards are subject to the Multi-Multiball\nJackpot Multiplier, so that you can actually be receiving\n20M or 30M for\nevery significant shot in the game.\n\nThe Mist Jackpot shots are: Castle Ramp, Coffin Ramp, Coffin, Tunnel, Right\nOrbit, Asylum, Top Sinkhole (if the Drop Target is malfunctioning,\nautolaunched balls will land here and be credited as a Right Orbit shot),\nand the Altar.  Completing the Rollover Lanes or a set of Bank Targets does\nnot count as a Mist Jackpot.\n\nOn normal settings, if you have not lit Mist Multiball by the beginning of\nyour third ball (not counting Extra Balls), it will be lit for you\nautomatically (except on Hard settings).\n\nLighting Mist Multiball twice does not stack it at the Tunnel.  Mist\nMultiball can be lit while Mist Multiball is running, although it will not\nactually be awarded if Mist Multiball is currently running (thankfully).\nThis may vary according to machine and ROM revision, of course.\n\nMist Multiball is a two-ball multiball.  If the motorized magnet has been\ndisabled on your machine, hitting Mist Multiball will immediately start it,\nwithout carrying a ball across the Mist Lane.  Also, if you have two balls\nin play because of a Ball Search, Mist Multiball will start immediately,\nand draining one of those balls will end it, as if you had started it\nnormally.\n\nWhen Mist Multiball begins, Love Never Dies is active briefly.\n\n\nCoffin Ramp\n\n\n\nThe initial value of the Coffin Ramp is\n500K (except on Extra Easy settings, in which case\ntwo values are spotted for free).\nHitting the Coffin Ramp increases this value\n(500K,\n1M,\n1.5M,\n2M,\n2.5M) and returns the ball to the Left Inlane, which\nlights the Coffin Ramp 2X.\nHitting the Coffin Ramp with 2X lit awards twice\nthe Coffin Ramp value, but does not change the number of ramp hits needed\n(this may have been different on prototype rules).\n\nWhen the 2.5M or 5M\nvalue is collected, the Coffin Ramp is raised and you can\n\"lock\" balls in the Coffin underneath (it does not appear that\nthese locks are worth 2.5M or 5M,\nbut if you somehow manage to trigger the Coffin Ramp\nsensor while the Coffin is open, you are given these points, along with\ncredit for locking the ball in the Coffin).  Balls are not actually kept in\nthe coffin; they are dropped amongst the Jet Bumpers, but you are given\ncredit for the successful locks (watch the two lights on the top of the\nCoffin).\n\nWhen you lock the third ball, Coffin Multiball begins.  Be sure to check out\nthe morphing animation for the third lock.  Also watch for\n\"DO HO\" written on\na brick to the left of the Coffin in the animations.\n\nOn normal settings, the Coffin Ramp is advanced one stage for a successful\nSkill Shot, regardless of how many times you have started Coffin Multiball\nalready.  This will go as far as opening the Coffin, but will not give you\ncredit for locking balls unless you actually hit the Coffin.\n\nIf the Coffin Ramp gets stuck in the raised position, the game compensates by\nadvancing the Coffin Ramp for an open Coffin shot, but does not attempt to\nre-lower the ramp when this happens.  Similarly, if the Ramp is stuck in the\nlowered position, the Ramp sensor behaves as the Lock sensor should.\n\n\nCoffin Multiball\n\n\n\n\n\"Players will be 'coffin up' quarters to lock three balls for\nCoffin Multiball!\" - promotional flyer\n\nDuring Coffin Multiball, the Coffin remains open.  Coffin Jackpots are\ncollected by spelling D-R-A-C-U-L-A, and every ball shot into\nthe Coffin spots a\nletter in D-R-A-C-U-L-A.\nIf 2X is lit, every ball spots two\nD-R-A-C-U-L-A letters.  When\nCoffin Multiball starts, 2X\nis lit, and it is lit for a while after every\nsuccessful Coffin shot on which 2X\nwas not lit or after every pass through\nthe Left Inlane.  Every letter represents a stake in Dracula's heart, and\ncompleting the sequence destroys Dracula.  The animations and sound effects\nfor attacking and destroying Dracula are not\nto be missed, unless your machine is in Family Mode,\nin which case you are denied their gruesome beauty.\n\nThe Coffin Jackpot value is\n20M,\n30M,\n40M,\nmaximum 50M.  If three or more\nballs are still in play when the Jackpot is collected, its value is doubled.\nThe Coffin Jackpot appears to start at 40M on some machines.  The game manual\nimplies that the Coffin Jackpot value may be increased by Jet Bumper hits,\nbut it appears that it is merely increased to the next base value when it\nis collected.\n\nWhen you collect a Coffin Jackpot, you immediately begin work on spelling\nD-R-A-C-U-L-A again, for the next higher Jackpot value.\n\nD-R-A-C-U-L-A letters are carried over between Coffin Multiballs.\nWhen the game\nbegins, no D-R-A-C-U-L-A letters are spotted.  Therefore, the\nfirst Coffin Jackpot\nwill require a minimum of four Coffin shots, although every second one may\nrequire only three.\n\nCoffin Multiball should be a three-ball multiball, although the machine will\nsometimes only deliver two balls, or will sometimes deliver three and end\nMultiball when any one ball drains.\n\nWhen Coffin Multiball begins, Love Never Dies is active briefly.\n\n(Note that in the movie, the scenes corresponding to Coffin Multiball did\nnot involve Dracula; rather, they were attempts to kill Lucy.)\n\n\nMulti-Multiball\n\n\n\n\n\"This will really slay the pinball pro!\"\n- promotional flyer\n\nMultiball modes are non-exclusive in Dracula.  This means that you can light\nLocks and start other Multiballs while one or two Multiballs are already in\nprogress.  If two Multiballs are in progress, all Jackpots are doubled.  If\nall three Multiballs are in progress, all Jackpots are tripled.  This\nMultiplier also applies to Bats mode, Rats mode, and the Carriage Bonus.\nThis allows for maximum Coffin Jackpots of\n300M, Castle Jackpots of 480M, and\nmakes all shots worth an additional\n30M (because of Mist Multiball).\n\nIf two or three Multiballs are in progress, four balls should be put into\nplay.  At a minimum, starting another Multiball will place at least one more\nball into play, unless you already have all four.  You only need to keep two\nballs in play in order to maintain all of your current Multiball modes.  The\nmachine usually keeps excellent track of the number of balls in play,\nalthough it may occasionally become confused when all three Multiball modes\nare running\n(\"confused\" means it ends Multiball when two balls are left, and\nends your entire ball when one of those drains, or that it ends both Multi-\nMultiball and your entire ball when one of the last two balls drains).\n\nNote that once you have started all three Multiball modes simultaneously and\nLove Never Dies has expired, there is no longer any way to put additional\nballs into play.\n\nThe lamps just above the flippers indicate which Multiball modes are in\nprogress, and what the current Jackpot multiplier is.\n\n\nVideo Mode\n\n\n\nShooting the Right Orbit or making a successful Skill Shot spots a letter\nin V-I-D-E-O.  Spotted in reverse order, the letters award\n100K,\n500K,\n1M,\n3M,\nand 5M, with the last\nletter (V) awarding Video Mode.\nVideo Mode can also be lit by a Mystery\nAward from the Tunnel.  Start Video Mode by shooting the Right Orbit; the\nball should pass the lowered Drop Target and enter the Sinkhole (if the ball\nfails to enter the Sinkhole, you are merely awarded\n5M, and\nV-I-D-E-O remains\nfully lit).  On some machines and ROM revisions, it doesn't matter if the\nV letter is spotted or not;\nVideo Mode will start when the V is flashing or\nalready lit.  On others, 5M is awarded for lighting Video Mode,\nbut the Drop\nTarget does not lower until the next Right Orbit shot.  Or the behavior may\nbe unpredictable.\n\nIf Video Mode is lit when a ball is launched into play and no Multiball modes\nare active, sometimes the Drop Target will be lowered and Video Mode will\nbegin, sometimes not.\n\nDuring Video Mode, use the flipper buttons to fire your handgun left and\nright at incoming werewolves (Children of the Night).\nYou have five more bullets than\nthere are werewolves.  Merely completing Video Mode is worth a base value of\n5M, and you are awarded\n10M,\n5M,\n1M,\n500K,\n100K,\nor nothing additional,\ndepending on how many bullets you have remaining.  Shooting werewolves that\nare very close to you can be worth up to\n1.5M, whereas shooting distant\nwerewolves is worth as little as a measly 50 points.\n\nIf you are too slow to shoot a werewolf (this is unavoidable if you have run\nout of bullets), it will eat you, ending Video Mode for no additional bonus.\nThe next Video Mode you begin will be the same as the one you failed to\ncomplete.\n\nTypically, an Extra Ball is awarded for successfully completing the second\nwave of Video Mode.  Otherwise, it is not especially point-rich.  Get more\npoints out of it by shooting werewolves late, or have more fun by shooting\nthem early (quick draw).\n\nOn Extra Easy settings, three letters in\nV-I-D-E-O are lit at the beginning\nof the game, and completing the Video Mode leaves the next Video Mode lit!\nYou are also given twenty bullets to shoot ten werewolves in the first wave.\n\nAt the end of Video Mode (successful or not), the ball is kicked out of the\nAsylum, and V-I-D-E-O is unlit.\n\nNote that you can Tilt during Video Mode.\n\n\nAsylum\n\n\n\nThis catch area is almost completely worthless.  Renfield is kept in the\nAsylum, and dropping a ball in here (which is always by accident; it is not\nactually shootable from either flipper as far as I can tell) shows a brief\nanimation and awards\n5M.  You can get a different ending to the animation by\nflipping, for which you are awarded an additional 5M.\n\nIf a ball wanders into the Asylum during any Multiball mode, you will see\na brief animation of a hand grabbing or chasing some sort of scorpion or\nother nasty little creature (a reference to Renfield), which awards\n1M the first time, 2M the second,\nand so on.  There are also quotes for this.  During Mist Multiball, this\ndoes not (or should not) count as a Mist Jackpot, I believe.\n\n\nEnd-Of-Ball Bonus\n\n\n\nI'm not sure how the End-Of-Ball Bonus is computed, but the graphics for it\nare beautifully gross.  Most likely, targets such as Jet Bumpers and\nSlingshots contribute to the End-Of-Ball Bonus.  The main part of the Bonus\nis not held over, but all other parts (Rats, Bats, and Bonus Multiplier) are.\nThe game next shows the Rats and Bats bonuses, which are not subject to the\nBonus Multiplier, thank goodness.  The graphics for the Bonus have been\nchanged slightly between prototype and L-1 releases.\n\nNote that in newer ROMs, there is a bug concerning the End-Of-Ball Bonus.  If\nyou get a Tilt warning just as the ball crosses the Outlane sensor or lands\nin the trough (I'm not sure exactly which, possibly both), the game will\npause and then proceed to the next ball without awarding\nANY of your Bonus!\nThe game is not Tilting, but simply cheating you.  This is verified as a\nbug, not intentional behavior.\n(I have seen the same behavior, albeit very rarely, from Dr. Who.)\n\n\nMiscellaneous Scoring\n\n\n\nJet Bumpers are\n10,010 points.\nSlingshots are 10.  Yes, that's right, 10.\n\n\nEaster Eggs\n\n\n\nDuring the game, a close-up of Dracula's eyes appears on the display at\nrandom intervals.  When his eyes are crossed (typically during idle periods\nearly in a game), press the Start button for a picture of Fluffy the Vampire\n(he looks suspiciously like one of the Doctors from Dr. Who!) and\n20 points.\nThis may or may not work if you have credits in the machine (the Start button\nmay start another game instead).\n\nYou can also consider the Asylum behavior described previously as an Easter\nEgg.  Flipping during the Renfield animation awards an additional\n5M.\n\nCows: As far as I am aware, there are none.  Please tell me if you know\notherwise.  I'd like to see a Cow in Video Mode somewhere.  :-)\n\n\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\n\n\n\nMulti-Multiball is the real key to super-high scores on Dracula.  Starting\nmore than one Multiball mode gives you nice things to shoot for from both\nflippers, and provides some insurance against quick drains.  I tend to avoid\nstarting any Multiball until I am very close to starting at least two of\nthem.  This means not shooting the Tunnel for Mist Multiball until there is\nonly one Coffin Lock left, or starting Castle Multiball while the others are\nlit.  Multi-Multiball also multiplies your Jackpots.  If one of your running\nMultiballs is Mist, everything will be worth at least\n20M.  If you are really\ngood at looping a ramp, catch the balls on one flipper and loop that ramp\nwith one ball on the other.  Note that the game will not call out the Mist\nvalues awarded while you are looping, or it may make the loop sound twice,\nthen call out the value twice, on alternate loops.\n\nMist Multiball is easier if the ball starts at the left end of the Mist Lane,\nbut this will only be true immediately after triggering Mist Multiball but\nnot knocking the ball free.  If you are not already in a Multiball mode and\nyou miss the traveling ball, it's quite difficult to get a clean second shot\nat it, if any.  You may want to hold up the left flipper and try to bump the\nball over for an easier shot at it from the right flipper.\n\nBats mode is usually nothing but frustration.  Both Bats and Rats are best\nwhen run during a Multiball mode; this can build both bonuses into the\nhundreds of millions!  I think that having the Bats and Rats bonuses carry\nover between balls is a terrible idea which places far too much value on\ngetting good Bats and Rats bonuses in early balls.\n\nAlways keep track of which Multiball will be advanced by the next Bonus from\nLoops, and of how many Loops you have and what is awarded when.  Be careful\nnot to waste Bonus awards which light Castle Locks, or to light Mist\nMultiball when it is already lit.  It's better to start the current Mist\nMultiball and use it up, if you're about to light another anyhow, as you can\nsafely light a second Mist Multiball during that Mist Multiball.\n\nYou can shoot the open Coffin from a ball trapped on the right flipper.\nRelease and flip as soon as the ball will clear the slingshot, and the ball\nshould go up, hit the inside left side of the Coffin, and land in the\nsinkhole.  Of course, this may be somewhat machine dependent.\n\nYou can shoot the Tunnel from a ball trapped on the left flipper.  Release\nand flip as soon as the ball will clear the slingshot, and the ball should\ngo straight up, just missing the post at the right edge of the Castle Ramp,\nand straight into the Tunnel.\nIf you miss, it will rattle around and may\nget knocked in by the Jet Bumpers.  This is actually (in my opinion) an\neasier and safer shot than from the right flipper.\n\nTo pass the ball from the left flipper to right, shoot the Coffin Ramp if it\nis lowered, then hold the left flipper up and bump the ball over.  To pass\nfrom the right to left, shoot the Tunnel.  Normal flipper passes are a bit\ntrickier than usual because of the short flippers.\n\nFind out if you can catch balls ejected from the Altar on your machine.  This\ncan be very useful.  The ejected balls should come past the right slingshot\nand neatly to the right flipper, if the kickout is properly adjusted.\n\nDeath Saves don't seem especially difficult on this machine, even with a\nsensitive Tilt.  In general, Dracula is very good about keeping track of the\nnumber of balls in play.  If you manage to shake a ball loose from a lock\n(the lower left end of the Mist Lane is a very good example), it will\npromptly put a ball in the Plunger Lane, raise the lane ramp, and relock a\nball to make up for it.  It can get confused with all three Multiballs\nrunning at once, though.  (\"Confused\" is bad, remember?)\n\nBang Backs can also be achieved from either side, although the right side is\nof course somewhat prone to a Slam Tilt.\n\nIf there is a ball sitting behind the gate at the left end of the Mist Lane,\nyou can easily shake it free at any time (the gate is not held down by\nanything but gravity), and the machine will understand what has happened.\nThis can be a free Extra Ball if you're quick enough.\n\nIf the Tilt is especially liberal on your machine, you can get Mist Multiball\nby simply shaking the machine front to back to get the traveling ball to\nfall from the Mist Lane.\n\nThe center set of Bank Targets are extremely dangerous to shoot for; they\ntend to direct the ball towards the center drain.  Unfortunately, the left\nset is very difficult to hit at all.  This, combined with the fact that\nCastle Locks time out, makes starting Castle Multiball a bit more difficult\nand unpredictable than it should be.\n\nThe diverter on the Castle Ramp is only active when the game sees a ball go\nup that ramp.  It may come down too slowly on some machines, which will tend\nto knock the ball into the return lane of the Coffin Ramp.  The worst\npossibility is that the ball will completely miss the scoring sensors for\nboth ramps, awarding you nothing.  Otherwise, you will get credit for\nhitting the Coffin Ramp or the Coffin itself, if it is open.  This makes it\npossible to get quite a few Coffin shots from the Castle Ramp by making a\nfast shot when the diverter is active, and then holding the left flipper up\nand repeating the process until the diverter functions properly.  If you\nmanage to start Coffin Multiball and/or score Coffin Jackpots this way,\nshame on you.\n\nDracula very much feels like a Bally game, specifically\nDr. Who.  It has\nDotMation and the same Status Report.  The Castle Ramp instantly reminded\nme of the Cliffhanger ramp on Dr. Who.  The yellow flippers with black\nrubber are just like Dr. Who.  Having Jackpot values be somewhat dependent\non the number of balls in play is also reminiscent of Dr. Who.  Since Barry\nOursler is the principal designer here as well as on Dr. Who, this isn't much\nof a surprise.\n\nIn layout, however, Dracula strongly resembles Bad Cats, of all things.\nSince Barry Oursler is the principal designer here as well as on Bad Cats,\nthis isn't much of a surprise.\n\nNote: flipping will abort almost any animation which is delaying gameplay\nwhile the ball is being held somewhere.  Unfortunately, this means you may\nnot see what your Mystery Award was.  This feature is best for skipping the\nrather lengthy but repetitive Replay animation (nice music and graphics,\nthough).\n\nIn general, Dracula is a much simpler\n(but not necessarily easier) game\nthan many other recent releases.  It has great graphics and sound...\n\n\nQuotes\n\n\n\nI believe that this quotes listing is quite accurate and almost complete,\nexcept for the mumbling of the Sisters when Castle Locks are made.\n\n \"Welcome to my home.\" (start game)\n \"Welcome to the Carpathians.\" (start game)\n \"Do you believe in destiny?\" (start game)\n \"Everlasting love.\" (Love Never Dies)\n \"Our love is stronger than death.\" (Love Never Dies)\n \"You are safe with me.\" (Love Never Dies)\n \"I give you life eternal.\" (Love Never Dies)\n \"I am Dracula.\" (random)\n \"I never drink... wine.\" (random)\n \"I hear you are a man of good... taste.\" (random)\n \"There is no life in this body.\" (random)\n \"I am the monster that breathing men would kill.\"\n(random)\n \"I am the last of my kind.\" (random)\n \"Do not fear me.\" (random)\n \"See me now.\" (random)\n \"There are no limits to science.\" (random)\n \"How few days go by to make up a century.\" (random)\n \"Get the Extra Ball.\" (Extra Ball lit by Loops)\n \"Extra Ball!\"\n \"Winds, Winds, Winds!\" (beginning of Mist Multiball)\n \"Ten Million\" (Mist Multiball)\n \"Twennnty Million\" (Double Mist Multiball)\n \"Thirrrrrrrrrrrty Million\" (Triple Mist Multiball)\n \"Vampires do exist.\"\n(Coffin Ramp 500K)\n \"It is a beast, a monster!\"\n(Coffin Ramp 1M)\n \"Dracula fears us.\" (Coffin Ramp 1.5M)\n \"A moment's courage, and it is done!\"\n(Coffin Ramp 2M)\n \"It is here that we must find him and destroy him\nutterly!\" (opening Coffin)\n \"Do not fail here tonight!\" (starting Coffin Multiball)\n \"I've seen many strange things already!\"\n(light Castle Lock)\n \"I know now that I am a prisoner.\" (light Castle Lock)\n \"I just want to cut off her head and take out her\nheart.\" (light Castle Jackpot)\n \"We may yet save her precious soul!\"\n(light Double Castle Jackpot)\n \"She is the Devil's Concubine!\" (Castle Jackpot)\n \"I cast you out, Prince of Darkness, into Hell!\"\n(Double Castle Jackpot)\n \"Lives, I need lives for the Master!\"\n(Asylum in Multiball)\n \"Would you care for an hors d'oeuvres, Dr. Seward?\"\n(Asylum in Multiball)\n \"Ha ha ha!\" (end of Multiball)\n \"You think you can destroy me with your idols?\"\n(start Rats)\n \"Your puny efforts amuse me.\" (fail Rats)\n \"My revenge has just begun.\" (start Bats)\n \"Your struggles are futile.\" (fail Bats)\n \"Listen to them, the Children of the Night.\"\n(starting Video Mode)\n \"You are the love of my life, alive again.\" (Replay)\n \"I have crossed oceans of time to be with you.\"\n(Special)\n \"Oh, this is too easy...\" (quick side drain)\n \"You are but mortal, after all.\"\n(side drain)\n \"I feel like a blundering novice!\"\n(end of extremely poor game)\n \"Blood is too precious a thing in these times.\"\n(end of game)\n \"We shall do battle once more.\" (Match)\n \"I condemn you to living death.\" (Match)\n \"You are a worthy opponent.\" (high score)\n \"Behave yourself.\" (Tilt, only on newer ROMs)\n \"Aren't you forgetting something?\"\n(press Start, no Credits)\n\n\n\nThe Movie\n\n\n\nI've seen it, liked it quite a bit.

You'll just get incredibly\n\tfrustrated.\n\nHere's what I believe is the optimal strategy for Dracula.\n0. NEVER attempt to hit the castle lock targets unless it's\n\tduring the time you start a multiball and the ball saver is on.\n1. Hit the right ramp 5 times to ligh coffin lock, and then pass the\n\tball to the right flipper.Do not start locking balls, because\n\tit's risky. anytime the ball is sent into the pop bumpers,\n\tit's like Russian Roulette. The reason we LIght the lock\n\tfirst is so that 12 Left Ramps will award a castle lock lit\n\tinstead of advancing Coffin by one measly ramp! This little\n\ttrick is a MAJOR factor in getting castle locks safely!\n2. Start hitting the Left ramp. This is the bread and butter shot\n\tof the game. Ultimate Glory awaits those who can hit this\n\tshot anytime. At 3 ramps, it will start Bats. DO NOT\n\teven bother trying to hit switches to maximize Bats. Just\n\tKeep hitting the left ramp.\n3. At 5 left ramps, mist is lit. If your castle lock targets are\n\tclose to being lit (i.e. one center hit away to light castle\n\tlock), then hit the left ramp to light caslte\n\tlock from the award at 6, and then once more to collect the\n\tlock. Now start mist multiball. While the ball saver is\n\ton, hit the center target to light another castle lock!\n4. During Mist, collect 1 or 2 coffin locks if the oppurtunity\n\tpresents itself. I prefer to trap one ball on the left fliper,\n\tand loop the left ramp with the other. The idea is to get\n\tall three multiballs going.\n5. Ok, now you're in the state where just about every multiball is\n\tready to get started. You should go for Mist first if\n\tpossible, since if you start mist during another multi, the\n\tballs flying around keep you from getting a clean shot.\n\tSecond priority is Castle multi, because you can lock\n\tup to two balls in the left ramp to get them off the\n\tplayfield for about 20 seconds. Keeping the playfield\n\tclear will allow you to make unobstructed shots. So in\n\tour preferred order, we start mist, get the third castle\n\tlock from the targets during ball saver, start castle\n\tmulti, then go for a coffin shot or the sinkhole to collect\n\tthe jackpot, which ever is a safer shot. Never get greedy\n\tand try to start the coffin right away. Collect a couple of\n\tcastle jackpots a couple of times if you don't get a good\n\tclean collected shot at the coffin. Don't force up a bad\n\tshot. Dracula is the most unforgiving game every made.\n\tyou can't afford to take a risky shot on the fly. Only\n\ttake controlled shots off a dead catch or a bounce pass.\n6. All three multis are started: Go for Coffin or Castle?\n\tPreferably Castle, since you can lock two balls up there\n\tand clear the playfield for a clean shot at the jackpot.\n\tBut again, don't force a shot. If you have a clean shot\n\ton the left flipper, take a shot at the coffin. But if you\n\tare given the choice, Let the ball bounce pass to the\n\tright flipper or do a dead catch from the right flipper\n\tto take a shot at the left ramp or sink hole.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Dracula", "possible_shots": "castle lock targets, right ramp, left ramp, center target, coffin locks, sinkhole", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/dracula-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Earthshaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Earthshaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEARTHSHAKER RULE SHEET\nCompiled April, 1993\nby Brian Falardeau\n\n\nGOAL\nThe main object of Earthshaker is to complete all of the zones for the\ncurrent building, which leads to Multiball play and the Jackpot score.\nEach building starts with a number of \"predictions\" for the next quake.\nEach prediction corresponds to one of nine zones located on the playfield.\n\nUpon completing all of the predicted zones, the first-ball may be locked by\nhitting the ball into the shelter (unless disabled by the operator) or by\nhitting the ball up the fault.\n\nOnce the first ball is locked, the Earthquake Institute predicts zones\nfor the second quake.  Upon completing the zones, the second ball is\nlocked by hitting the ball up the fault.  With two balls locked, the\nplayer shoots a third ball into play to begin a 3-ball Multiball.\n\nFor the first round, the zone visits can be in any order (all zones are\nlit from the beginning).  For the second round, the zone visits must be\nrow-by-row, but may be in any order within each row (zones 4, 5, and 6\nwill only be lit after zones 1, 2, and 3 are completed).  After the second\nround, each of the zone visits must be in numerical order.\n\nAs the game progresses, more zones are \"predicted\" for each quake, and\nenabling each lock for Multiball becomes harder to achieve.  Eventually\nall nine zones must be completed in numerical order to complete the\nbuilding.\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAFTERSHOCK\nThe Aftershock is an additional two-ball Multiball that is awarded if the\nball enters the shelter within 15 seconds after the end of normal Multiball.\nDuring the Aftershock, the Jackpot may be enabled and claimed in the same\nmanner as for Multiball (see MULTIBALL).\n\nBILLBOARD\nThe billboard is another term for the three drop targets.\n\nBONUS\nA bonus is awarded at the end of each ball as follows:\n\n(1K * total miles * bonus multiplier) + (20K * total fault trips)\n\nFor example, if 24 miles and 5 fault trips have been accumulated at the\nend of the first ball, and the bonus multiplier is at 3X, then the bonus\nwould be 72K for the miles and 100K for the fault trips.  Both the miles\nand fault trips are cumulative throughout the game.\n\nBONUS MULTIPLIER\nAfter a building is completed, the bonus multiplier is advanced to the\nnext level.  This is used to calculate the bonus at the end of each ball\n(see BONUS).  The bonus multiplier is cumulative throughout the game.\n\nThe current value is indicated by the lights just above the flippers.\nThe \"2X\" and \"3X\" (in white) are awarded in the first round of Multiball,\nthe \"4X\" and \"5X\" (in yellow) are awarded in the second round of Multiball,\nand the \"6X + LIGHT EXTRA BALL\" and \"6X + LIGHT SPECIAL\" (in red) are\nawarded in the third round of Multiball.\n\nBUILDING\nThe building, or Earthquake Institute, is located in the upper left region\nof the playfield.  It signals to the player the zones that still need to be\ncompleted before the lock for Multiball will be enabled.\n\nCAPTIVE BALL\nThe Captive Ball, zone 9, is located on the right side of the playfield\nbetween the stand-up targets.  Hitting the Captive Ball awards the current\npoint value (indicated by the five lights in front of the right slingshot)\nand usually spots the lowest zone that is not yet completed.  Spotting a zone\nmay, however, be disabled by the operator.\n\nThe point value starts at 25K.  Each center ramp shot increases the value for\na timed period to 50K, 100K, 150K, or 250K.  The timer can range from three\nto 20 seconds, but is usually set to about seven seconds.  After each timed\nperiod expires, the point value falls to the next lowest level.  If the 250K\nshot is hit, Quick Multiball is enabled and the point value returns to 25K.\n\nIf the ball enters the shelter, the non-timed minimum point value is increased\nto 50K or 100K.  If the shelter is entered twice, for example, the point value\nof the Captive Ball will not fall below 100K until the next ball or the 250K\nshot is hit.  This means that only two successive center ramp shots are needed\nto light the 250K shot.\n\nCENTER RAMP\nEach center ramp shot awards 1 or 2 miles depending on if the shot is made\nbefore the \"2 miles\" timer expires.  This timer is activated when the ball\npasses through the left return lane, and it normally lasts for about five\nseconds.  The operator may set this to anywhere between 1 and 20 seconds or\ndisable it completely.\n\nThe initial point value at the start of each ball is 25K, jumping next to 50K,\nand then increasing by 10K for each shot up to a maximum of 100K.  If the\nfirst shot is made before the 50K timer expires, then the scoring starts at\n50K.  After 99 miles, each center ramp shot is worth 200K.\n\nThe center ramp is also used to increment the point value of the Captive Ball,\nand to enable the Jackpot during Multiball.\n\nDROP TARGETS\nThe three drop targets are located near the bumpers at the base of the\nbuilding.  Hitting all three targets awards the current point value,\nresets the targets, and increments the value of the Jackpot.\n\nThe initial value at the start of each ball is 50K, and increments by 10K\n(up to 100K) each time the targets are reset.  The \"BILLBOARD VALUE 100K\"\nMatch-up award sets the point value to the 100K limit.\n\nEARTHQUAKE INSTITUTE\nThe Earthquake Institute is the name of the building (see BUILDING).\n\nEJECT HOLE\nThe eject hole, zone 5, is located near the upper left flipper directly to\nthe right of the stand-up target.  The ball is ejected to the left, which\nbrings the ball down past the upper left flipper.  If enabled, the eject\nhole will will lock the ball for Quick Multiball, which allows the player to\nput a second ball into play.\n\nEND OF ROAD BONUS\nMiles stop accumulating after 99 miles.  At this point, each shot up the\ncenter ramp will award 200K points.  The \"light 2 miles\" switch loses its\nmeaning.  There is not an equivalent bonus for making additional fault trips\nbeyond the upper limit of 69.\n\nEXTRA BALL\nThe following will light the extra ball award, which is claimed when the\nball enters the shelter:\n\n\n  Accumulating 12 miles (this is the factory setting, but the operator\nmay change this to any value up to 75 miles, turn it off completely,\nor allow the value to change based on the level of play).\n  Accumulating 60 miles (this is the factory setting, but the operator\nmay change this to any value up to 75 miles, turn it off completely,\nor allow the value to change based on the level of play).\n  Completing the building for the 5th time.\n\n\nThe following will immediately award an extra ball:\n\n\n  The \"Extra Ball\" Match-up award.\n  The \"1.5 Million + Extra Ball\" Jackpot award.\n  The third million shot of a game.\n\n\nThe following are additional ways to receive an extra ball if set by the\noperator, but are not common:\n\n\n  On a replay.\n  As a special award.\n\n\nThe operator may also set the maximum number of extra balls, ranging from\none to nine, that can be awarded to a single player.\n\nFAULT TRIP\nThe fault is the ramp on the right side of the machine that places the ball\nin the upper left corner of the machine.  This is the most important shot\nof the game.  Making a \"fault trip\" awards three miles, spots the lowest\nuncompleted zone, and locks the ball for Multiball if the building is\ncompleted.  During Multiball, a trip to the fault awards the Jackpot value\nafter it has been enabled (see JACKPOT).\n\nThe ball will be ejected up the habitrail and directed towards the center\nramp, which will bring the ball back to the lower left flipper.  If the\nfirst ball is being locked for Multiball, however, the California/Nevada\nstate maps will separate and the ball will be directed to the shelter.\n\nEach trip to the fault adds a 20K bonus at the end of each ball (see BONUS).\nMaking a fault trip during Multiball will award 250K points if the Jackpot is\nnot yet enabled or if it has already been claimed.  During Multiball the ball\nwill be directed towards the shelter rather than to the center ramp.\n\nJACKPOT\nThe Jackpot value is indicated by the lights on the backglass, which is\nincremented when the drop targets reset (this includes the start of a ball).\nThe possible values are 500K + SPECIAL, 1M, 1.25M, 1.5M, 1.5M + EXTRA BALL,\n2M, and 2.5M.\n\nDuring Multiball (except for Quick Multiball), the player must first make\nthe center ramp shot to enable the Jackpot.  The Jackpot is then claimed by\nmaking a fault trip.\n\nIf the Jackpot is not claimed by the end of Multiball, the player has a timed\nperiod to hit the ball into the shelter for an additional two ball Multiball.\nDuring this \"aftershock\", the Jackpot may be enabled and claimed in the same\nmanner.\n\nJET BUMPERS\nThe lighting of the Jet Bumpers is advanced by hitting the ball around\nthe loop.  The \"Jet Bumpers On\" Match-up award will set the lighting to\nthe maximum setting.  The stages of the Jet Bumper lighting are as follows:\n\n\n All bumpers score 1,000 points (none lit)\n Red bumper scores 2,000 points (red lit)\n Blue bumper scores 2,000 points (red and blue lit)\n Yellow bumper scores 2,000 points (all lit)\n Red bumper scores 3,000 points (red blinks)\n Blue bumper scores 3,000 points (red and blue blink)\n All bumpers score 5,000 points (all blink)\n\n\nThe initial Jet Bumper lighting at the beginning of each ball may be set to\nany of the above stages.  The factory setting is stage two (red bumper lit).\n\nLOOP\nThe loop is located at the top of the playfield.  It is typically hit from\nthe upper left flipper (sending the ball just to the left of the fault trip)\nor from the right flipper (sending the ball past the upper left flipper)\nThe loop completes zone 6 and advances the lighting of the Jet Bumpers.\n\nMATCH-UP\nA Match-up sequence is started by hitting the ball into the shelter, which\nwill award one of 10 possible Match-up values.  These values appear in the\nupper and lower display panels.  When both panels display the same value,\na Match-up occurs and the displayed value is awarded.  The 10 values are:\n\n\n  2 MILES\n  5 MILES\n  100,000 POINTS\n  QUICK MULTIBALL LIT\n  LIGHT SPECIAL\n  ZONE COMPLETED (Spots lowest uncompleted zone)\n  COMPLETE BUILDING (Spots all uncompleted zones)\n  BILLBOARD 100K (Drop Target value at maximum)\n  JET BUMPERS ON (Jet Bumper lighting at maximum)\n  EXTRA BALL (instant extra ball)\n\n\nThe more valuable awards (complete building, light special, and extra ball)\nare awarded much less frequently than the others.  The Match-up will not\naward a value that is already completed.  The \"Zone Completed\" value will\nnot be awarded, for example, if the building is already completed.\n\nAfter a Match-up sequence is completed, the ball returns through a habitrail\ninto the right return lane.  The Match-up sequence is shortened if a ball\nis locked for Multiball, since the locked ball must be ejected before the\nball that just entered the shelter comes and replaces it.\n\nThe Match-up is not awarded during any Multiball, when locking the first\nball for Multiball, or when locking the ball for the Aftershock.\n\nMILES\nMiles are awarded for the following:\n\n\n  Hitting the ball up the center ramp (1 or 2 miles)\n  Hitting the ball up the fault ramp (3 miles)\n  As a Match-up award (2 or 5 miles)\n\n\nThe current number of miles is indicated by the lights on the left side of\nplayfield.  The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 30 will be lit so that the\ntotal of the numbers lit will equal the number of accumulated miles.  All of\nthe lights will be lit after 75 miles, at which point the actual number of\nmiles accumulated can only be determined by looking at the backglass display.\n\nAt the maximum of 99 miles, each center ramp shot awards the \"end of the road\"\nbonus of 200K points.\n\nMILLION SHOT\nThe Million Shot is only enabled during Quick Multiball, and it is claimed by\nmaking a fault trip.  If the Million Shot is made after the first ball has\nbeen locked in the shelter, then the normal 3-ball Multiball play will begin\nimmediately.\n\nThe third Million Shot of a game will award an extra ball.\n\nMULTIBALL\nAfter two balls have been locked, the player begins Multiball by shooting the\nthird ball into play.  After enabling the Jackpot by making a center ramp shot,\nit is claimed by making a fault trip.\n\nIf one of the balls enters the shelter during 3-ball Multiball, it will be\nheld until one of the remaining two balls is lost.  The shelter will not hold\nthe ball, however, once the Jackpot has been awarded.\n\nAfter both balls are lost, the player has 15 seconds to hit the ball into\nthe shelter for an additional two-ball Multiball called the Aftershock.\n\nEach trip to the fault during Multiball before the Jackpot is enabled or\nafter it has been claimed awards 250K points.\n\nQUICK MULTIBALL\nQuick Multiball is enabled as a Match-up award or by hitting the Captive\nBall when the point value is 250K.  When enabled, hitting the ball into\nthe eject hole (zone 5) will lock the ball for a two-ball Multiball.\n\nDuring Quick Multiball the Million Shot is enabled (see MILLION SHOT).\nWhen putting the second ball into play, the locked ball will pop out\npast the upper left flipper for an immediate attempt at the Million Shot.\n\nThe Jackpot is not enabled during Quick Multiball.\n\nSCENIC DRIVE\nThe scenic drive is another term for the center ramp.\n\nSHELTER\nThe shelter is located just to the right of the center ramp.  If the lock\nis enabled (indicated by a flashing green light), the first ball will be\nlocked for Multiball.  The factory setting always allows the first ball to\nbe locked via the shelter, but the operator may change this so that both\nballs must be locked by making a fault trip.  Another setting allows the\nfirst ball to be locked via the shelter only on the first round.\n\nIf the lock is not enabled, or the first ball is already locked, the shelter\nwill award a Match-up (see MATCH-UP).  An extra ball will also be awarded\nwhen enabled (see EXTRA BALL).\n\nAfter two of the three balls have drained during Multiball the player has\n15 seconds to \"head for the shelter\", which will awards an additional two-ball\nMultiball (see AFTERSHOCK).\n\nSKILL SHOT\nWhen putting a ball into play, the ball enters a spiral located in the upper\nleft corner of the playfield.  The spiral contains exits for 10K, 25K, 50K,\nand 100K points.  A strong shot from the plunger causes an \"overpass\", which\nawards 25K points and 1 mile.  The overpass directs the ball to the lower left\nflipper which allows the player a shot at the center ramp before the 50K timer\nexpires.\n\nSPECIAL AWARD\nA special award is lit, and remains lit until claimed, by completing the\nbuilding for the sixth time.  If one special is enabled, it will switch\nbetween the left and right outlanes when the ball hits a bumper or slingshot.\n\nA second special award is lit, and remains lit until claimed, by accumulating\na certain number of miles.  The operator may set this to anywhere between\n50 and 99 miles or disable it completely.  Normally the special will be lit\nat about 75 miles.\n\nA special award may also be lit as a Match-up award, but this is extremely\nrare.  This special award, however, will be disabled at the end of the current\nball.\n\nThe special award is claimed when a ball passes through an outlane when the\nspecial is lit.  Normally this awards a free game, but the operator may set\nthis to award points or an extra ball instead.\n\nSPINNER\nThe spinner is located above the bumpers at the entrance to the loop.  It\nawards 1,000 points for each full revolution (or 3,000 when lit).  The\nspinner is lit when the ball passes through the right return lane, and stays\nlit for about ten seconds (may by set to anywhere between one and 20 seconds).\n\nZONES\nThe playfield contains nine \"zones\" as follows:\n\n\n  Left stand-up target (near the upper left flipper)\n  Upper right stand-up target (to the left of the Captive Ball)\n  Lower right stand-up target (to the left of the Captive Ball)\n  Center stand-up target (just to the right of the center ramp)\n  Eject hole (next to the upper left flipper)\n  Loop (around the upper portion of the playfield)\n  Right return lane\n  Left return lane\n  Captive Ball\n\n\nFor the first round, the zone visits can be in any order (all zones are\nlit from the beginning).  For the second round, the zone visits must be\nrow-by-row, but may be in any order within each row (zones 4, 5, and 6\nwill only be lit after zones 1, 2, and 3 are completed).  After the second\nround, each of the zone visits must be in numerical order.\n\nAs the game progresses, the number of zones that need to be completed for\neach building increases, making Multiball harder to achieve.\n\nSOUNDS\nThe following voices are heard during the game (M = male, F = female):\n\n\n M  \"It's sunny drive time!\"                Starting a game\n M  \"They've locked on with all the hits.\"  Completing the building\n M  \"EARTHSHAKER!!!\"                        Locking a ball for Multiball\n M  \"Take a scenic fault drive today.\"      Starting Multiball\n M  \"Check out the fault today.\"            Enabling the fault for Jackpot\n M  \"Head for the shelter!\"                 During timer for Aftershock\n F  \"Ooh, give me shelter!\"\t\t      During timer for Aftershock\n F  \"Ooh, bitchin'!\"                        Receiving/starting an extra ball\n F  \"Ooh, million!\"                         Million shot enabled\n F  \"M-M-M-Million!\"                        Million shot awarded\n F  \"Ooh, Jackpot!\"                         Jackpot enabled\n F  \"J-J-J-Jackpot!\"                        Jackpot awarded\n\n\nSCORES\nThe following summarizes the scoring in Earthshaker.  For a more descriptive\nexplanation of certain items, such as the scoring for the center ramp, see the\nentry in the glossary.\n\n\n Bumpers         1010 (off), 2010 (lit), 3010 (blink), or 5010 (all blink)\n Captive Ball    25K, 50K, 100K, 150K, or 250K\n Center ramp     25K, 50K, 60K, 70K, 80K, 90K, 100K, or 200K\n Drop targets    50K, 60K, 70K, 80K, 90K, or 100K\n Fault trip      50K (normal) or 250K (Multiball)\n Jackpot \t   500K/Special, 1M, 1.25M, 1.5M, 1.5M/Extra Ball, 2M, or 2.5M\n Loop            20K (normal) or 100K (Jet Bumpers)\n Outlane         50K\n Return lane     5000\n Skill shot      10K, 25K, 50K, or 100K\n Slingshot       110\n Spinner         1000/revolution (unlit) or 3000/revolution (lit)\n Stand-up        25K (unlit) or 40K (lit)\n 50K Stand-up    25K (unlit) or 50K (lit)\n Zone (lit)      40K\n\n\nTIPS\n\n  Master the fault trip.  This is by far the most important shot of the\ngame.  Use it to accumulate miles, spot the more difficult zones\n(zone 6 and zone 9), and receive the Million and Jackpot scores.\n\n  Pound the miles.  This leads to extra balls and basically boosts up\nyour score.  This especially true after 99 miles, when each center ramp\nshot is worth 200K points and the bonus is worth up to 594K points.\nWork on consecutive center ramp shots to accumulate the miles faster.\n\n  After hitting the shelter twice, the Captive Ball will stay lit at\n100K.  It then takes only two consecutive center ramp shots to\nlight the 250K shot.  If you feel like gambling (it's a sucker shot),\ngo for the Captive Ball to enable Quick Multiball.  Usually it's\nworth the gamble, since it can lead to the M-M-M-Million shot.\n\n  On Quick Multiball, don't shoot the ball too hard to cause it to\ncause the ball to \"overpass\" into the center ramp.  This puts the\nball on the lower left flipper at just about the same time the second\nball gets ejected past the upper left flipper, which ruins your\ninitial chance at the Million shot.\n\n  If possible, shoot the ball into the \"overpass\" when starting Multiball\n(except for the Quick Multiball).  This gives a good shot at the\ncenter ramp to enable the Jackpot before the other balls get in the way.\n\n  It's almost always a good idea to shoot for the eject hole (zone 5) from\nthe right flipper.  This will eject the ball so that it rolls slowly\npast the upper left flipper for an attempt at the fault.\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Earthshaker", "possible_shots": "AFTERSHOCK, BILLBOARD, BONUS, BONUS MULTIPLIER, BUILDING, CAPTIVE BALL, CENTER RAMP, DROP TARGETS, EARTHQUAKE INSTITUTE, EJECT HOLE, END OF ROAD BONUS, EXTRA BALL, FAULT TRIP, JACKPOT, JET BUMPERS, LOOP, MATCH-UP, MILES, MILLION SHOT, MULTIBALL, QUICK MULTIBALL, SCENIC DRIVE, SHELTER, SKILL SHOT, SPECIAL AWARD, SPINNER, ZONES", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/earthshaker.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Earthshaker", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Eight Ball Deluxe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Eight Ball Deluxe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEight Ball Deluxe\n\nby Stephen Jonke\n24 Sep 1993\n\n\nI haven't played the computer version, but here's a basic rundown of the\nrules of the real machine.  I won't bother with the layout of the game\nsince I presume you've seen the computer version.\n\n\n Ball drop targets (right side bank of 7 drop targets).  Alternate players\nplay alternate sets of balls (they're the same targets, just numbered with\ndifferent lights) -- that is, player one plays 1-7, player two plays 9-15,\nplayer three plays 1-7, ...).  Score 2k each.  Knocking down all 7 targets\nlights the 8 ball drop target.  The game remembers who had what targets\ndown and resets to the same state on your next ball (one of the cooler\nfeatures of 8BD -- it resets all of them, then knocks down the ones that\nshould be down.)\n\n 8 Ball target (upper right corner).   Scores the point value lit on the\nplayfield: (if none lit it scores some trivial value, 500 I think), 20k,\n40k, 60k and increases the value to the next higher level.  If the 8 ball\nis hit when 60k is lit (or if the ABCD lanes advance the value beyond 60k\n-- see below), then the corner pocket and outlanes light for special.  The\noutlane special lights alternate with sling shot (and pop bumper?) hits.\nWhen 8 ball target is lit, hitting it lights the playfield DELUXE targets.\nWhen Special light between flippers is lit, scores special.  The second and\nthird times (or optionally, only the third time) that the LIT 8 ball target\nis hit, a special is also scored (the special light between the flippers\nwill be lit when the 8 ball target will score this value.)  Note that\nhitting the 8 ball NEVER resets the ball drop targets (apparently the PC\nversion does this?)!!!\n\n Corner Pocket (pothole behind 8 ball drop target).   Scores (\"Super bonus\" +\nbonus) * multiplier -- bonus includes ball targets that are down in current\n\"rack\".  It's possible to set this to score bonus only (no multiplier.)  If\nspecial light in front of pothole is lit, scores special as well.\n\n Multiplier targets (upper left inline drop targets).  Scores value\nindicated on playfield (I forget the exact values offhand) and sets\nmultiplier to value on target (2x, 3x, 4x, 5x.)  These targets are\ndeceptively difficult to hit safely.\n\n Bank shot (round target behind multiplier targets.)  Scores lit value on\nplayfield: 50k or special.  Can be set so that value alternates with each\nhit, or so that you can only get one special off it per ball.  Also, can\nset for first value to be 50k, or for it to be special.\n\n Left loop.  Scores lit value (500 points when not lit) and lights next\nhigher value.  The sequence of LIGHTS is: 10k, 30k, 50k, extra ball, 70k,\nspecial.  The sequence of SCORING those values can be set to one of two\noptions:  10k, 30k, 50k are always first.  The rest of the sequence is\neither: EB, 70k, special and camp on 70k; or EB, 70k (camp on 70k) then on\nnext sequence (i.e. all following balls until sequence is completed again),\n70k, special, (camp on 70k).  So, the latter option means the first time\nthrough you can get an EB, but you can't get a special.  The second time\nthrough you can get a special, but not an EB (hope that made sense!)  Then\nit's back to the first sequence.\n\n A/B/C/D lanes.  In 3 ball play the normal setup is that getting either C or\nD will spot both C & D.  It can be set so that they must be gotten\nseperately.  Getting all the letters (A, B, C and D) spots some drop\ntargets (settable to one or two.)  The uppermost unhit target(s) will be\nspotted.  Also starts one thumper bumper flashing (order lit is upper left,\nupper right, bottom), and increases the value of the 8 ball drop target.\nIf A and B (the top rollovers) are gotten and either C or D is still lit,\nthen one of the top rollover lanes will be lit for 25k points.  The lit one\nalternates with thumper bumper and slingshot hits.  After ABCD is completed\nthe 25k light goes out.\n\n Thumper Bumpers (pop bumpers).  I THINK they are worth 500 points when not\nflashing.  A flashing thumper bumper is worth 3000 points per hit.\n\n Playfield DELUXE (6 round targets offset behind and between ball drop\ntargets).  Score 3k, lit or unlit.  When lit, also unlights the\ncorresponding letter.  Getting DELUXE scores the value lit on the\nplayfield: 50k or special (which alternates and is settable similar to the\nbank shot) and resets the ball drop targets.  It is possible to set it to\nNOT reset the drop targets, but instead relight the DELUXE targets (which\nis no fun IMHO.)  If drop targets are reset, then getting DELUXE also adds\n56k (=8*7) to the \"super bonus\" (SB).    In any case, if DELUXE is lit and\nthe ball drains before completing it, 56k is added to the SB and the drop\ntargets will be reset on the next ball.  The game can be set so that on the\nnext DELUXE after a failed attempt only the remaining lights will be lit,\nor it can be set so that they all relight.  In addition, scoring DELUXE on\nthe playfield lights the next unlit letter in DELUXE on the backglass\n(optionally this can be set so that only DELUXE's that net a special add a\nletter).\n\n Backglass DELUXE.  Getting the backglass DELUXE (see above) causes the\nDELUXE letters to do a \"dance\" :) and wins a settable number of specials (0\nto 3) -- CLACK! CLACK! CLACK!  These letters remain lit between games.\n\n Bonus = (\"super bonus\" + (7k * ball drop targets currently down)) *\nmultiplier.  Note that the lit 8 ball target when knocked down counts as\nwell, but not if it was NOT lit.)\n\n Super Bonus.  Super Bonus is either 0, 56k or 112k.  Each time DELUXE is\nlit and completed, AND IF getting deluxe resets the drop targets, then 56k\nis added to the Super Bonus.  In addition, if DELUXE is lit (by getting all\nball targets and hitting the lit 8 ball), but is NOT completed before the\nball drains, 56k will be added (and the drop targets will reset on the next\nball).  The value is kept throughout your game and maxes out at 112k.  One\nthing I'm not certain about is what happens at the end of your current ball\nif the SB is 112k and you get and finish DELUXE during the ball, reseting\nthe drop targets -- does your bonus for that ball include 168k SB, or still\nonly 112k?  I need to check this out.  Keep in mind that the SB is added to\nthe normal bonus BEFORE multiplying.\n\n\nWHEW!!  And some people say that these old games aren't complicated!  I'm\nsure I've left something out, or gotten something wrong, so post\ncorrections.\n\nSteve\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Eight Ball Deluxe", "possible_shots": "Ball drop targets, 8 Ball target, Corner Pocket, Multiplier targets, Bank shot, Left loop, A/B/C/D lanes, Thumper Bumpers, Playfield DELUXE, Backglass DELUXE, Bonus, Super Bonus", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/eightballdeluxe.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Eight Ball Deluxe", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

INTRODUCTION:\n\n\"Elvira and the Party Monsters\" is a game by Dennis Nordman and is\ndated August 1989 (according to the manual).  It is an extremely\nhumorous, spooky-themed pin, hosted by the \"Mistress of the Dark\"\nherself, Elvira, and her \"Party Monster\" friends.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Elvira, she is the alter-ego of Cassandra\nPeterson, who rose to fame as a TV hostess of grade-B monster movies\non a local American TV station.  She'd host the showings of the films,\nthrowing in funny/gruesome comments along the way.  If you never saw\nthe TV show, you can rent her movie, \"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark\",\nwhich came out in 1989.  Her birthday is September 17, 1951.\n\nThe game credits are as follows:\n\nThis is a Nordman, Freres, Penacho, Granner, Pugh, Patla, Ritchie\nand Peterson production.\n\nMonstrous Support:  Joos, Bil, Bauer, Ortega, Scalzo, Delgato,\nValosek & Co., Grabel, Haeger's 3DFX, Deal, Cardenas & Co,\nSharpe and The Line.\n\nDennis Nordman is known for numerous other games such as Party Animal,\nBlackwater 100, Dr. Dude, Party Zone, Whitewater, Demolition Man,\nIndianapolis 500 and his last, Scared Stiff.  It is rumored that the\ngame was uncompleted at the time of his departure, and was finished\nup without him.  :-(  \"Scared Stiff\" also makes a reference on the\nbackglass, in the form of a book titled \"Black Thursday\", presumably\nthe day Dennis, and other fine Williams folks, were \"downsized\".  If\nit's any consolation, Elvira's latest favorite pin is, of course,\n\"Scared Stiff\" (as said to me by the Mistress of the Dark herself,\non Monday, 11/18/96).\n\nIndy500 is said to have a very similar playfield layout as Elvira does\n(and it does), and the more and more I play Elvira, the more I can see\nfringes of the same strategic forethought of what to shoot next, that\nmakes Whitewater such a great game.  I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nELVIRA was made shortly after the Williams/Bally merger.  Though the\ngame uses a vaguely Bally-style cabinet and Bally-style flippers, all\nthe rest of the game hardware (including System 11B CPU and associated\nboard setup) are made up of 100% Williams parts.  This is a plus, so\nthat owners don't have to go hunting for long obsolete Bally parts\n(ie: coils, brackets).\n\n2. PLAYFIELD LAYOUT:\n\nWe'll take this in the usual clockwise fashion, starting from the left\nflipper:\n\n\n Left Flipper  Standard 3\" yellow Bally-style flipper.  This is actually\na Williams-style flipper, with a Bally-style flipper\nplastic on top.  The Bally-style plastic is approximately\n1/4\" longer than a Williams-style flipper, it does not\nhave the \"W\" logo and the top is not smooth.  Instead,\nit has vertical grooves, perpendicular to the length of\nthe flipper.  I have these installed for \"original\naesthetics\" purposes.\n Left Slingshot  Standard size slingshots for this era.\n Left Inlane  Completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS lights the left inlane for\n25 thousand points.  Scores 5,000 points when unlit.\n PARTY PUNCH Return Habitrail  Metal habitrail that returns the ball\nfrom the PARTY PUNCH (right) ramp\n(popper), and empties into the left\ninlane.\n Left Outlane  Awards SPECIAL when lit.\n WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS  Four standup targets along the left-hand wall.\n SKULL LOCK  Something of a left-orbit shot, except that the ball curves\naround a U-Turn in back and lands under the MONSTER SLIDE\nramp, just behind the BARBECUE targets.\n MONSTER SLIDE Ramp  This is the left-ramp entrance.  This ramp curves\nup and back behind the playfield back-wall, to\nreturn down the bouncy MONSTER SLIDE return\nramp, to the right inlane.\n BARBECUE Targets  These are two \"flip-up\" targets, that vaguely face\nthe lower-right corner.\n BOOGIE MEN  Two dancing \"Boogie Men\", with no game purpose whatsoever,\naside from pure pinball fun!\n CENTER EJECT HOLE  Shoot straight up the center lane and land the\nball in the eject hole saucer, at the top.  The\nsaucer kicks the ball out to the B-A-T rollover\nlanes, to the right.\n B-A-T Lanes  Rollover Lanes in the upper-right corner of the playfield.\nThe ball typically shoots here from the shooter lane, the\nSKULL LOCK and the CENTER EJECT HOLE.\n DEAD HEADS  Three \"Dead Head\" images imprinted on silver mylar but only\nseen when lit!  A very cool effect, trust me.  They \"hang\"\nout on the upper-right back wall.\n THUMPER BUMPERS  Three, arranged in a typical fashion.  These are\nBally-Style \"Thumper Bumpers\", where the whole bumper\nbody moves up and down every time a bumper is actuated.\n J-A-M Drop Targets  Three-Bank of Drop-Targets, that vaguely face a\npoint 1/3 up the left wall.\n PARTY PUNCH Ramp  This is the right-ramp entrance.  The ball curves\naround toward the back and lands in a ball popper,\nwhich returns the ball to the player via a metal\nhabitrail that empties into the left inlane.\n PIZZA PASSAGE  Something of a right-orbit shot, that tosses the ball\nup into the B-A-T lanes, instead of out a left-orbit.\n GRAVESTONE-PIZZA  Two standup targets along the right-hand wall.\n Shooter Lane  Manual plunger, with a metal rail that shoots the ball\nup towards the B-A-T lanes.  Only misses on rare\noccasion.\n Right Outlane  Awards SPECIAL when lit.\n MONSTER SLIDE Return Ramp  Return ramp for the MONSTER SLIDE.  The\ntight metal ring the ball has to pass\nthrough often slows the ball down\nconsiderably, before dropping it into the\nright inlane.\n Right Inlane  Completing GRAVESTONE-PIZZA lights the right inlane for\n25 thousand points.  Scores 5,000 points when unlit.\n Right Slingshot  Standard size slingshots for this era.\n Right Flipper  Same as Left-Flipper, except in reverse (go figure!)\n\n\n3. SKILL SHOT:\n\nPull the plunger back far enough to shoot the ball out onto the\nplayfield.  It awards you 0 points, but it's a lot more fun than\nwatching the ball fall back into the plunger lane.  Share this\nskill with newbies.\n\n4. WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS:\n\nThese are four standup targets along the left-hand wall.  Completing\nWAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS will light one of the cool looking DEAD HEADS,\nlocated behind the silver mylar, in the upper-right corner wall.  For\ncompletion of the targets, per ball, you get:\n\n\n   20,000 points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the first time.\n   40,000 points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the second time.\n   50,000 points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the third time.\n   60,000 points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the fourth time.\n   70,000 points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the fifth time.\n   80,000 points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the sixth time.\n 200,000 points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS every\ntime after the sixth time, plus a very\ncool, playful little tune.\n\n\nThese point values carry over from ball-to-ball until Million is\nlit, then the values reset at the start of each ball.\n\nCompleting WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the third time, lights the CENTER\nEJECT HOLE for 1 Million points, untimed, till the end of the ball.\n\nCompleting WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the fourth time resets the lit\nDEAD HEADS back to the first one.  They are only reset this way\nonce per ball.\n\nCompleting WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS the sixth time, on the same ball,\nlights SPECIAL.\n\nCompleting WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS also lights the left inlane.\n\n5. SKULL LOCK:\n\nShoot the Skull to lock the ball, when lit.  The flashing eyes\nof the Skull indicate how many balls are locked.  The Skull\nkicks balls out from behind the BARBECUE targets, over the\ncenter lane (hopefully), and into the THUMPER BUMPERS.\n\nThe Skull kicker is known to kick weakly on a regular basis, such\nthat ejected balls land in the center lane (and often go SDTM\n:-( ), instead of making all the way over to the bumper area.\n(see also Section 28: HARDWARE)\n\nThe Skull can also be shot to collect 3 Million, when lit.  This\nis a 20-second timed event, accompanied by extremely cool music.\n\nThe LOCK lamp is not stackable, but lets face it, LOCK is not\nexactly a difficult thing to light on this Nordman game.  In\nother words, this ain't Whitewater.  :-)\n\n6. MONSTER SLIDE RAMP:\n\nThe MONSTER SLIDE (left) ramp awards:\n\n\n   SCORE  Awards 50,000 to 300,000 points, progressively, in\n25,000 point increments per ramp shot.\n\n   Light HOLD BONUS  Two (operator adjustable) consecutive ramp\nshots light HOLD BONUS at the CENTER EJECT\nHOLE.\n\n   Light MILLION  Four (operator adjustable) consecutive ramp\nshots will light the ramp for 1 Million points\n(timed).  Each time you light the 1 Million\nshot, the number of ramp shots required goes\nup by one.  This maxes out at 11 ramp shots\n(or, the 300,000 point shot).\n\n   Award MILLION  When lit (see above).\n\n   E-L-V-I-R-A letter  Complete B-A-T, J-A-M or WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS,\nto light ramp for an E-L-V-I-R-A letter\n(timed).  Consecutive ramp shots after\ncollecting 1 Million will also award an\nE-L-V-I-R-A letter, plus 250,000 points.\n\n   SPECIAL  When lit.\n\n\nDuring Multi-Ball, both ramps must be shot in order to collect\nthe Multi-Ball Jackpot award.  After collecting the Jackpot,\nand before the end of Multi-Ball, the ramp awards \"Party Ramp\"\nat 250,000 points per shot.\n\nShooting two balls up the MONSTER SLIDE ramp in quick succession,\nduring Multi-Ball, awards a 500,000 point \"Double Slide\" award.\n\nUnfortunately, all of the usual awards, save for SPECIAL, are\nsuspended during Multi-Ball.\n\n7. BARBECUE TARGETS:\n\nThese are rather unique items on ELVIRA.  Under a clear plastic\ndome are two coffins.  ELVIRA is in one on the left (Chief Cook)\nand DRACULA is in the one on the right (Chief Kook).  Shoot the\ntargets sticking out the bottom (should be shaped like the bottom\nthird of a tapered coffin).  A clean, direct shot is required to\napply enough force to flip up the coffin top.  Opening both\ncoffins lights the BARBECUE BONUS at the CENTER EJECT HOLE.\n\nThe coffins are reset (shut) upon collecting the BARBECUE BONUS,\nor at the start of each ball.\n\n8. CENTER EJECT HOLE:\n\nThe CENTER EJECT HOLE can be lit for the following awards:\n\n\n  BARBECUE BONUS\n  BOOGIE BONUS\n  1 Million Points\n  HOLD BONUS\n\n\nThe CENTER EJECT HOLE ejects the ball to the right, above\nthe B-A-T rollover lanes.\n\n9. BARBECUE BONUS:\n\nShoot the BARBECUE TARGETS to light the CENTER EJECT HOLE for the\nBARBECUE BONUS random award.  Possible awards are EXTRA BALL,\nBONUS MULTIPLIER, light an E-L-V-I-R-A LETTER, Mystery Score or\nSPECIAL.  The BARBECUE BONUS lamp is not stackable.  :-(\n\nMystery Score has been seen as low as 50,000 points and as high\nas 200,000 points.  It appears to be random number.\n\n10. BOOGIE BONUS:\n\nComplete the J-A-M Drop Targets to light the CENTER EJECT HOLE for\nthe BOOGIE BONUS.  The BOOGIE BONUS starts at 25,000.  As long as\nBOOGIE BONUS is lit, the THUMPER BUMPERS add 1,000 points, per hit,\nto the BOOGIE BONUS.  Completing J-A-M again while BOOGIE BONUS\nis lit adds 10,000 points to the BOOGIE BONUS.  The BOOGIE BONUS\nitself, maxes out at 255,000 points.\n\n11. B-A-T LANES:\n\nCompleting the B-A-T lanes awards a Bonus Multiplier (2X to 5X),\nlights the SKULL LOCK (as needed), and lights the MONSTER SLIDE\nfor an E-L-V-I-R-A letter.\n\nCompleting B-A-T if the Bonus Multiplier is maxed at 5X, awards\n(progressively) 70,000-90,000,110,000-130,000-150,000 points,\nmaxing at 150,000 points.\n\n12. THUMPER BUMPERS:\n\nAs long as BOOGIE BONUS is lit, the THUMPER BUMPERS add 1,000 points,\nper hit, to the BOOGIE BONUS.  Aside from that, they also rotate the\nSPECIAL lamp.\n\nTHUMPER BUMPERS are also called JUMPER BUMPERS, both on the game\nflyer and on the game instruction card.  They are called THUMPER\nBUMPERS, though, in the game manual.\n\nThe game flyer states \"A Bally Pinball Exclusive!\" and \"I'm the first\nto give players the vertical action they've been waiting for!\"  So,\napparently, this means that Elvira was the first pinball game to use\nJUMPER/THUMPER BUMPERS.\n\n13. J-A-M DROP TARGETS:\n\nCompleting the J-A-M Drop Targets lights the CENTER EJECT HOLE for\nthe BOOGIE BONUS, lights SKULL LOCK (as needed), and also lights the\nMONSTER SLIDE for an E-L-V-I-R-A letter.\n\n14. PARTY PUNCH RAMP:\n\nThe PARTY PUNCH (right) ramp progressively awards:\n\n175,000 points\n200,000 points\n225,000 points + Light Extra Ball\n250,000 points + Extra Ball\n\nOnce the Extra Ball is collected, the ramp resets to a 100,000\npoint base value, and progressively awards:\n\n100,000 points\n125,000 points\n150,000 points\n175,000 points\n200,000 points\n225,000 points + Light Extra Ball\n250,000 points + Extra Ball\n\nIf an Extra Ball is collected twice off the ramp, the ramp then\nresets to a *10,000* point base value (they really don't want\nyou to get the next EB), and then progressively awards:\n\n10,000 points\n25,000 points\n50,000 points\n75,000 points\n100,000 points\n125,000 points\n150,000 points\n175,000 points\n200,000 points\n225,000 points + Light Extra Ball\n250,000 points + Extra Ball\n\nThe current point value of the ramp is held over from ball to\nball until the EXTRA BALL is collected.  Once the EXTRA BALL\nhas been collected, the ramp will reset to the base value at\nthe start of every ball.\n\nThe point value of the ramp can be calculated by adding up\nthe values on the lit bottles of \"potion\", on the playfield\n(except when value is at 10,000 points), in front of the ramp\nentrance.\n\nThere appears to be no limit to the number of EXTRA BALLS you\ncan collect in this way (save for operator set maximums), but\nit won't be easy.\n\nDuring Multi-Ball, both ramps must be shot in order to collect\nthe Multi-Ball Jackpot award.  After collecting the Jackpot,\nand before the end of Multi-Ball, the ramp awards \"Party Ramp\"\nat 250,000 points per shot.\n\nUnlike the MONSTER SLIDE, the PARTY PUNCH ramp retains all its\nstandard award values during Multi-Ball.\n\nLast, Elvira is one of the (relatively) few pinball games with\na \"Consolation Extra Ball\" prize (also known as the \"Pity\" EB)\nsuch that if the game feels you are doing particularly bad, it\nwill automatically light the Extra Ball lamp on the Party Punch\n(right) ramp, at the start of your third ball.\n\n15. PIZZA PASSAGE:\n\nCompleting the GRAVESTONE-PIZZA targets lights the PIZZA PASSAGE,\nprogressively, for HEADCHEESE, EYE OF NEWT and then LIZARD TOUNGE.\n\nThe PIZZA PASSAGE awards:\n\n25,000 points if nothing is lit.\n50,000 points if HEADCHEESE is lit.\n100,000 points if HEADCHEESE and EYE OF NEWT are lit.\n150,000 points if all three are lit.\n\nCollecting PIZZA PASSAGE resets all lights.\n\n16. GRAVESTONE-PIZZA:\n\nThese are two standup targets along the right-hand wall.  Completing\nGRAVESTONE-PIZZA will light one of the lights along the PIZZA PASSAGE.\nYou also get 20,000 to 200,000 points (progressively), in 20,000 point\nincrements for each completion of GRAVESTONE-PIZZA.\n\nCompleting GRAVESTONE-PIZZA also lights the right inlane.\n\n17. MULTIBALL:\n\nMulti-Ball starts with one of the best sound and light packages\nI've ever seen!  It's worth just seeing the effects, assuming\nthe game is in full working order.  Lock three balls in the\nSKULL LOCK to start Multi-Ball.  All three balls are ejected\ninto the THUMPER BUMPERS, which is a particularly good place\nto park balls during Multi-Ball, since you can place a ball\nthere either by shooting the SKULL LOCK, CENTER EJECT HOLE\nor PIZZA PASSAGE.\n\nDuring Multi-Ball, the ramps are lit for the \"Party Monster\nMultiball Jackpot.  You must shoot both ramps to collect\nthe Jackpot.  The Jackpot value may either be Progressive,\nor fixed at 4 Million points.\n\nThe Progressive Jackpot begins at a base 1 Million points,\nand is incremented by all standard points awarded while in\nMulti-Ball, to a maximum of 4 Million points.  The Progressive\nJackpot value is held over from game-to-game, until collected.\n\n\"Standard Points\" means you would be points awarded for\na ramp shot, or a target, would be added to the Jackpot.\nHowever, additional points awarded for completing a set\nof targets or rollovers, would not be added to the Jackpot.\n\nAfter collecting the Jackpot, and before the end of Multi-Ball,\nthe \"Party Ramps\" award 250,000 points per shot.\n\nAlso, shooting two balls up the MONSTER SLIDE ramp in quick\nsuccession, awards a 500,000 point \"Double Slide\" award.\n\n18. E-L-V-I-R-A:\n\nShoot the MONSTER SLIDE (left) ramp, when lit, to collect an\nE-L-V-I-R-A letter.  The ramp can be lit for an E-L-V-I-R-A\nletter, either by completing B-A-T, J-A-M, WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS\nor collecting the 1 Million MONSTER SLIDE (left) Ramp shot.\nYou can also collect E-L-V-I-R-A letters from a random\nBARBECUE BONUS award.\n\nOnce you spell E-L-V-I-R-A, the SKULL LOCK is lit for 3 Million\npoints.  This is a 20 second timed event.  If you fail to make\nthe 3 Million shot, the game will reset to E-L-V-I (operator\nadjustable), until you collect it.\n\nE-L-V-I-R-A letters may be carried over from ball-to-ball,\ngame-to-game, or not at all, via operator adjustment.  The\ndefault is game-to-game (ie: always).\n\n19. EXTRA BALL:\n\nAn EXTRA BALL can be collected from the PARTY PUNCH (right) ramp\n(when lit), or as a random award from the BARBECUE BONUS.  And\nyes, it's worth collecting one, just to hear the quote.  :-)\n\n20. REPLAY:\n\nWell, replays are awarded for achieving a pre-defined score.\nCheck your status report for this score.\n\nScoring a replay fires a delightfully **LOUD** knocker in\nthe backbox, and is accompanied by a particularly nice\nsound and light show.  In particular, the playfield lamps\nare flashed according to COLOR SCHEME.  I've yet to see\nany other game make use of the color schemes like that,\nusually they go for patterns, thus, I felt this deserved\na whole separate section.  :-)\n\n21. SPECIAL:\n\nSPECIAL is lit by completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS six times\n(twice lighting all three Dead Heads) on a single ball.\nThe SPECIAL lamp starts on the MONSTER SLIDE (right) ramp,\nthen moves to the left outlane, then the right outlane,\nthen back to the ramp, on each hit of a THUMPER BUMPER or\nslingshot.\n\n22. BONUS POINTS:\n\nBonus on this game is like the old days.  You pick up bonus points,\nfor hitting various things around the game.  None of it carries over\nfrom ball to ball, unless you collect HOLD BONUS.  Bonus Multipliers\nare never held over.\n\nFrom around the game, you get:\n\n\n   1,000 bonus points to start, however, you don't get another 1,000\nif you had HOLD BONUS lit on the prior ball.\n   1,000 bonus points for any inlane switch (lit or unlit).\n   1,000 bonus points for knocking down a J-A-M DROP TARGET.\n   1,000 bonus points for any B-A-T rollover lane (lit or unlit).\n   1,000 bonus points for completing the B-A-T rollover lanes.\n   3,000 bonus points for any outlane switch (lit or unlit).\n   3,000 bonus points for completing WAKE-THE-DEAD-HEADS.\n   3,000 bonus points for completing the J-A-M DROP TARGETS.\n   3,000 bonus points for any E-L-V-I-R-A letter.\n\n\nCompleting the top rollovers will give you a bonus multiplier, from 2X\nto a maximum of 5X.  The bonus itself maxes out at 99,000 bonus points.\n\n23. BOOGIE MEN:\n\n\"Let's Boogie!!!\"  These two guys are perhaps one of the\nmost favored toys in Pinball history.  They do nothing,\nother than jump up-and-down, dance and make people laugh.\nThey have also been considered the ancestors of the dancing\nMartians on ATTACK FROM MARS.  Shoot the CENTER EJECT HOLE\nwhile the BOOGIE BONUS is lit to make them dance.\n\nNice shorts, too. :-)\n\nThere are *nine* Boogie Men represented around the game.\nUnfortunately, only two of them dance.  Can you find them\nall?\n\n24. GAME QUOTES:\n\nAs a System 11B game, ELVIRA has an astonishing number of fairly\nhigh-quality quotes.  Most of the quotes come from Elvira herself,\na few from Dracula, and one or two believed are from the Skull\nat the lock and the Cyclops at the entrance to the MONSTER SLIDE\n(right) ramp.  The quotes from the game are:\n\nElvira:\n\n\n  Hey, Lets Party!\n  Oh, Deja-VU!\n  Now We're Cookin'\n  Don't Touch Me There!!\n  Oooh, Nice Organ!\n  How 'Bout Another Ball?\n  Let's Boooogie!!!\n  Party Pooper!\n  Oooh, Monstrous!!!\n  Oh, Yeah!\n  Oooh, Jackpot!\n  Head for the Cauldron!!!\n\n\nDracula:\n\n\n  Thank You, Boys!\n  Get Down, Get Funky!\n  Lights!  Organ!!\n  Quick, to the Monster Slide!\n  Quick, to the Cave!\n  PARTY!!!!!!!\n  Blah!!!\n\n\nSkull Lock:\n\n\n  HA HA HA!!!\n\n\nCyclops:\n\n\n  Ooooh, YEAH!\n  Oh, NO!\n\n\nI'm told now that the voice of the Cyclops (and, based on the voice\nalone, possibly the Skull Lock) was done by Dennis Nordman himself!\n(Thanks, Sheri!)\n\n25. PARTY MONSTERS:\n\nThe name of the game is \"Elvira and the Party Monsters\".  In case\nyou were wondering ... collected from around the game are the\nfollowing guest \"Party Monsters\":\n\n\n    Boogie Men\n    Cyclops\n    Dead Heads\n    Dracula\n    Elvis (or, at least his tombstone)\n    Fireball (?)\n    Frankenstien\n    Ghosts\n    Green Blob\n    Grim Reaper\n    Lizard Hands (?) (They're holding up the Barbecue)\n    Man in the Moon\n    Mummy\n    Organ Player\n    Skeleton\n    Skulls\n    Smarkie (see QUESTIONS)\n    Spiders\n    Tree (dead looking, with a face in the trunk)\n    Wolfman (see below)\n    Vampire Bats\n\n\nOkay, so one or two are a bit questionable, but if it was found\non the game, I wanted it represented here in the list.\n\n26. ABOUT THE WOLFMAN:\n\nLook closely at the backglass.  Just behind ELVIRA's right\nshoulder is the Wolfman, who, we're told, bears more than a\npassing resemblance to Dennis Nordman, the game designer.\n\nWe are also told that game designer Jim Patla posed for\nDracula and artist Tim Elliott is the Muscle-Man.\n\n27. SOFTWARE:\n\nThe latest known software releases are:\n\n\n    LA-4:  Game Software -- Domestic release.\n    LG-4:  Game Software -- German release.\n    LU-4:  Game Software -- European release.\n\n\nThe final game software release, LA-4 / LG-4 / LU-4, is\nrather suspiciously dated on 10/13/89.  That would be in\nthe month of **October** (what better month, right?), and\non, of all days, ---Friday the 13th--- !  Pretty spooky,\nhuh?  :-)  I like it!\n\nFor comparison, the LA-2 Game Software release is only dated\n10 days earlier, on 10/3/89.  LA-1, however, is dated 9/12/89.\n\nWhat's in LA-4?  Here is a bulletin from Williams:\n\n\nPROBLEM\n\nThere is a problem with the \"contest mode\" setting in\nElvira in versions prior to LA-4.  In LA-1 through LA-3\nyou should not set contest mode to \"YES\".\n\nSOLUTION\n\nIn these earlier versions, you can get the same results\nas contest mode by making the following adjustments:\n\n\n\nAdj#\nAdj Name\nSetting\n\n35\nExtra Ball Auto\nFixed\n\n36\nJackpot Value\n4,000,000\n\n40\nElvira Memory\nPlayer\n\n44\nSave Locks\nNo.\n\n\nNOTE\n\nIn versions LA-4 and later, the contest mode setting\nworks correctly.  This was the only change from LA-3\nto LA-4, so it is not necessary to update your program.\nThere are no differences in versions LA-1, LA-2, and\nLA-3.  The changes that caused these revisions were\nfor French and German game programming.\"\n\n(end bulletin -- thanks, John)\n\n\nAs for sound:\n\n\n    SL-1:  Sound and Music.\n\n\nPlease Email me if you have any software release, other\nthan what is listed above.\n\nBugs:\n\nWell, this isn't exactly a bug, per se, but it is at least a\nquestionable design decision.  Some games of this era allow\nyou to \"steal\" locked balls from other players.  Elvira is\nnotably worse.  If you are playing a Multi-Player game, and\nPlayer A locks two balls, Player B may then lock one ball,\nand **START MULTIBALL**!  It is one thing to \"steal\" a locked\nball, but be able to steal full credit for a locked ball is,\nin my opinion, wrong.  What's worse is that the game doesn't\neven remember the locks lit by Player A.  Thus, they will need\nto relight the locks, before relocking the balls.  Nice, huh?\nThis was tested using LA-4 software.\n\nAnother, slightly \"iffy\" bug, is likely true for all System\n11-ish games.  This is when the scoreboard turns over (at\n100M points), the game will award you another Replay for\npassing the Replay score again (and again).\n\nSpeaking of the Replay score, the \"fixed\" Replay score settings\nonly range from 100,000 to 9,900,000.  Pretty limited range on\na game that can track scores as high as 99,999,990.\n\n28. HARDWARE:\n\nThis section is primarily for ELVIRA owners.  Elvira is a standard\nSystem 11B game.  The setup is still more a Bally-style though,\nwith the displays in a single row at the bottom of the backglass,\nwith Williams-style displays, thankfully!\n\nThe flippers, as mentioned above, use yellow Bally-style flipper\nplastics.  These items may still be available and can be ordered\nusing part #: 20-9592-6.  Some Bally-style flippers may have a\nridge in the shaft, near the bottom.  For best performance, you'll\nwant the ones with an entirely smooth shaft.  The yellow colored\nones (used on ELVIRA), really shouldn't have this problem, though.\n\nAlso, there are at least three documented cases of a faulty\nresistor controlling Solenoid 5C, which are the flashers for\nthe Man in the Moon (center of the playfield) and the Wolfman\n(on the backglass, to the left of Elvira).  Finding it hard\nto believe this is a pure coincidence, we believe the original\nfactory installed resistors were either part of a bad run, or\nwere possibly insufficiently rated.  I replaced mine, located\nat position \"R5\" on the backbox interconnect board, with a\n5 ohm, 5 watt wirewound resistor, and it appears to work just\nfine.\n\nThere are also problems with the lock (see section 5 above), so here\nis a bulletin from Williams on the topic (thanks again, John):\n\n PROBLEM\n\nExperiencing trouble with balls jamming up in the upper left\nball trough of Elvira.  If one ball is sitting in reserve and\nanother comes whipping in, the first ball will be knocked\nforward just a bit.  Then when the kicker tries to pop the\nballs out, the arm does not contact either ball.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nAbove the 3 switches, on the right side of the entry-way, there\nshould be a vertically mounted bolt.  The purpose of this bolt\nis to slow down balls that are shot into the mechanism.  If this\nis not doing the job (the ball should rattle a little between\nthe bolt and the left wall), then you should try installing a\n\"headless nail\", a little higher, and sticking out a little\nfarther (with enough room for the ball to clear).\"\n\n[Note: I have not tried this]\n\nELVIRA also suffered from problems with the cabinet graphics.\nMost ELVIRA games will show damage to the graphics, where the\ngame legs are screwed into the cabinet.  Many games show this\nsort of damage, but ELVIRA was, for some reason, particularly\nsusceptible to this problem.  Thus, if you can find an ELVIRA\ngame with the cabinet graphics about the legs intact, this is\na relatively rare find, so buy it, and make sure you dismantle\nit yourself, to hopefully prevent any damage.\n\nThe number of ELVIRA games actually made is still unknown.\nHowever, based on the information collected in the Internet\nSerial Number Database (Email  for more\ninfo), we can only account for a less than 2500 total units.\nA pretty small run for any time, but especially in 1989,\nwhen pinball was booming.  If anyone has reliable data to\nthe contrary, please Email me.\n\n29. GAME HISTORY:\n\nELVIRA is known to be a little risque.  As a precautionary\nmeasure, ELVIRA games were shipped with a small, black\nlingerie \"decal\", to be placed over ELVIRA's plunging\ncleavage on the backglass.  The software included a similar\noption to tone down the quotes.  This was the \"Rated-G\"\noption, intended to \"Protect the eyes and ears of the little\nParty Monsters\".  I don't know of any games that ever made\nuse of such items.  However, the lingerie decals remain a\nhard to find item.\n\nThe slingshot/outlane plastics are bordered by long bones.\nThe \"broken\" bones on these plastics are an \"inside joke\"\nabout Dennis Nordman's motorcycle accident, which occurred\nduring the development of Elvira.  (Thanks again, John)\n\nIn fact, Dennis Nordman broke many, many bones in the\naccident and basically designed Elvira from a hospital\nbed!  (Thanks, Sheri!)\n\nThe graphic on the right side of the game near the pizza passage\nwith the monster carrying a s**tload of pizza boxes.  One of\nthe pizza boxes is named \"Pinball Pete's\", and this is the name\nof the Arcade that Tim Arnold used to own (and subsequently sold\nto his brother) in Michigan.  Guess someone working on the game\nwanted to point out Tim and his efforts in pinball.\n\n30. SMARKIE:\n\nElvira is shown on the backglass, holding a Hot Dog on a large\nfork.  Written on the fork is \"I (heart) SMARKIE\".\n\nWHO THE HELL IS \"SMARKIE\"?\n\nSmarkie is a reference to her husband/manager Mark.\n\nAlso, one of the pizza boxes in the hands of Frankenstein carries\nthe inscription:  \"Tony and Barb\", which is a reference to pinball\nartist Tony Ramunni and his wife.\n\nYogi Travis ('Yo, Travis!', on the Deadhead tombstone) is a guy\nElvira used to play pinball with, way back.\n\nFrom \"Pinball Art\", by Keith Temple.\n\n31. VIDEO PINBALL:\n\nSo you say you can't afford a real \"Elvira and the Party Monsters\"\npinball machine?  Well, you may be in luck here, as there *is* a\nhandheld-video version of Elvira.  Atari Lynx has produced a game\ncartridge called \"Pinball Jam\", which includes two pinball games,\n\"Elvira and the Party Monsters\" and \"Police Force\".\n\nThis version of Elvira includes a scrolling screen, two-ball Multi-\nBall, and numerous Elvira quotes.  These quotes aren't exactly like\nthe original game.  Some are similar to the original, some are new\n(ie: they aren't included in the original game), and still others\ndon't appear to show up at all.  The quotes themselves are also\ndistributed in a different way ... for instance, the \"How 'bout\nAnother Ball?\" quote, is played at for *each and every* ball (except\nBall #1).\n\nI, myself, wasn't terribly impressed ... but then, it has that scrolling\nscreen, and I have the real thing at home, so I'm probably just a *tiny*\nbit biased.  :-)  This rendition really isn't bad, even if I was never\nable to directly hit the center eject hole as the flippers just wouldn't\ndo it.  Anyway, if you like Elvira, it's definitely worth a look.\n\nSpecial thanks go to Mark Kaufman for providing my test piece with the\n\"silver platter\" treatment.  :-)\n\n32. QUESTIONS:\n\n\n  Like many other games, the THUMPER BUMPERs are not General\nIllumination, they are controlled lights from the lamp\nmatrix.  Unlike many other games, the slingshots are ALSO\ncontrolled lights from the lamp matrix.  To the best of my\nknowledge, these are never used for anything other than\nthose superb light-shows, which is certainly a good enough\nreason for me.  However, has anyone ever heard of any other\nreasons?\n\n  There are no known differences between a \"Prototype\"\nElvira game, and a production model.  However, there\nare a couple suspicious \"holes\" in the solenoids and\nadjustments.  Solenoid 4A is listed as \"Unused\", and\nis kind of an odd place to have an empty solenoid slot.\nAt any rate, the software doesn't pulse it for any\nreason, except during the COIL TEST.  Also, Adjustment\n33 is \"Unused\", where the game rules span Adjustments 31\nthrough 46.  Now I really don't know what you might add\nto the game.  I suppose you could add a kickback, or a\nbackbox toy.  :-)  But like I said, the software ignores\nthat signal line.  Anyway, it's always interesting to\nknow what the game designers full intentions might have\nbeen.  Anyone who has reliable information on this topic,\nplease Email me!\n\n\n\"Oooh, Monstrous!!!\"  Indeed ... 32 items later, I'm done.\nPerhaps I went just a tad overboard, but this is really an\nawesome game, and I felt it was deserved.  Please Email me\n(see below) if you have corrections, suggestions, alternate\nROM versions or are interested in tips on purchasing a game.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Elvira and the Party Monsters", "manufacturer": "Midway Manufacturing Co.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/elvira.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Elvira and the Party Monsters", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

As of\nthis writing, there are 2 major and 2 minor problems with the machine\npreventing proper play. As these are worked out the document will be\nbuffed out. For questions or comments I can be reached at the following\naddress: bkemp@exodus.net\n\nLAYOUT:\n\nThis game has a somewhat unique playfield that borders on 3 levels.\n\nMAIN LEVEL:\n\n2 flippers in standard location\nBank of 3 targets on the left\nBank of 5 targets on the right\nBank of 3 drop targets upper right\n2 jet bumpers upper middle\nBall save / Instant multi-ball left outlane\nLifter to left side of second level\nLifter to right side of second level\nRamp to second level\n\n\nSECOND LEVEL:\n\nThe second level is in 4 parts, the left side, and the upper and lower right sides\nand a raised area. There is a bridge from the left side angling up to the upper\nright side. The bridge and about half of the second level have no barriers to keep\nthe ball from falling to the main level.\n\nSECOND LEVEL - LEFT:\n\nDrop hole - to left side lifter right back to second level.\nFlipper - Used for a skill shot across the bridge.\n\n\nSECOND LEVEL - RIGHT, UPPER:\n\nFlipper - Used for skill shots located on RAISED area.\nStar rollover - skill shot from left flipper.\n\n\nSECOND LEVEL - RIGHT, LOWER:\n\nThis area has 2 ways for the ball to travel, the first simply drops\nthe ball to the main play field while the second is a long slide that\ndrops the ball to the lower right flipper and increments the multi-ball\ncounter.\n\nSECOND LEVEL - RAISED:\n\nThe raised area is a roughly 5\" high ramp. Unlike most ramps, this one\nhas 2 skill shots that go behind the normal playfield. If the ball goes\npast both of these shots, it is returned to the left upper flipper.\nThe first skill shot adds to the treasure value and returns to the upper\nright flipper.

(Boy how times change). You kill General Yagov by\nkilling all eight of his planes, or buy getting a replay score.

Red lights flashing let you know when\nthe ball will lock.\n\n\n Jet Bumper  between the ball locks and the upper TOM CAT targets.\n\n Upper Middle TOM CAT Targets  between orbit, and Jet Bumper, use the\nupper flipper to score targets.\n\n 1-6 Targets  This Targets on vertical on either side of the Center Targets\n1-3 on the left and 4-6 on the right.\n\n Right Side CAT Targets  Three standard round targets, mid way up on the PF\nvertical on the right side.\n\n Left Side TOM Targets  Three standard round targets, mid way up on the PF\nvertical on the left side.\n\n Center Kill/Rescue Targets  Two standard round targets, located in the middle\nof the PF.\n\n Right Lock/Release/Landing VUK  Right upper shot that depending on what is\nlit delivers the ball to the diverter on the left.\n\n Orbit Flyby  left to right side delivers the ball back to lower flippers\nif you do not use the upper flippers, has Spinner on right side, Flyby is\nused to increase the Bonus.\n\n Left Ripoff/Extra Ball/Yagov KickBack  This delivers the ball back to the\nleft flipper at great speed.\n\n Flippers  Four standard length flippers, two lower and two upper directly\nacross from each other.\n\n Sling Shots  Standard size and in the usual location.\n\n Left Outlane/Rescue  Left Outlane has a kick back the delivers the ball\nto the upper part of the playfield, when lit.\n\n\nGame Play\n\nTo score big you should aim for MultiBall (MB) and then get three Landings,\nas well as up the Bonus to 8X.\n\n\n Ball Locks  To locks balls for MB you need to light one set of TOM and one\nset of CAT targets, then the Lock light is lit and you shoot for the right\nVUK to lock the ball.   The ball diverter has two sets of light for each\nball route.  Red flashing light means you have a lock just shoot the right\nVUK, solid Red tells you that a ball is already locked.  Blue lights let\nyou how many Landing you have made during MB.  \n\n Multi Ball  MB is started by locking three ball and then lighting TOM CAT\nagain and shooting Release (Right VUK). This starts the Four Ball MB. If\nyou are on a game in good shape after the third lock the Beacons on the Back\nbox light up and spin giving a great light show, and music waiting for you\nRelease shot.  While in MB three shots to Landing (right VUK) award 150K,\n250K and Jackpot which I has always seems to be 703,850. Landings add up\nso if you only get two in your first MB you can get the third during your\nnext MB.\n\n Special  If you light all the TOM CAT targets both upper and lower, while\nin MB then Special is lit on both outlanes, which award EB.\n\n 1-6 Targets  These target light in order from 1 to 6 and back to 1 hitting\na lit target lights the Bonus light in the Flyby orbit.  The Bonus is raised\nbut each orbit to a max of 8X after that EB Which can be collected by shooting\nthe left kick back.   The targets also light the 1k spinner on the right side\nof the Flyby orbit.\n\n Center Targets  These two targets alternate between each other and when lit\nrelights the Rescue (KB) on the left outlane.  Don't shoot the center targets\nstraight on as that will send the SDTM, shoot the sides of the targets.\nAfter your First Yagov Kill inlanes no longer light the Center Kill.\n\n Inlanes  Both left and right inlane have Lites Kill which if you then shoot\nthe two center targets award a Kill.   A Left inlane to right VUK will award\na Launch Bonus starting at 50K to 250k in 50k steps and also award a lock.\n\n Spinner  Spinner awards 1k per spin when lit, to light hit a lit 1-6 Target.\n\n Yagov Shot  Eight shots to Yagov award a EB. The eight shots are Alpha, Bravo,\nCharle, Delta, Echo, Fox, Golf.  Also can be used to start MB if\nyou light TOM CAT a second time after your third lock.  The KB has a grace\nperiod where you get Flight Insurance (another ball) if the KB drains your\nball.

There are two sets of tomcat\nletters.  One up between the upper flippers, one down near lower\nflippers (TOM where the bumpers are on TAF, CAT where the swamp is).\ntomcat can be spelled in any order using any combination of the targets.\n\nTo lock a ball you must shoot the right side (safe landing) shot.\n\nThe machine will fill any lit locks from plunger launches before putting\na ball into play (thus the occasional intentional use of the ball saver).\nThe plunger is manual, so you plunge multiple times.\n\nBonus Multiplier extra ball\n\nJust above each top flipper is a swinging gate.  When one it hit,\nit lights 'increase multiplier' on the other gate.  Earning 10x(?)\nmultiplier ON A SINGLE BALL lights the left side shot for an extra\nball.  Bonus multipliers are not carried from one ball to the next.\n\nOther notes\nThe game when properly maintained plays EXTREMELY fast.\n\nBall times are very long once you get good because there are no 'drain on a\nnear miss' shots (though hitting the center targets dead on is a good way to\ndrain).\n\nThe right outlane isn't bad, and the left one has a kickback.  The kickback\ncan be relit by hitting the lit center target any time except right after an\ninlane (when they register kills).  Which of the 2 center targets is lit\nalternates on a timer.  This shot is easy enough that you should almost never\nhave a left side drain.\n\nI have seen a couple games where the top center bumper does not work\nproperly.  The game plays terribly without it.  None of the places seemed\nable to fix it.  (One of them I know worked on it for a couple days in the\nbackroom.

Putnam\n\nJuly 28, 1998\n\nVersion 1.2\n\n\nIntroduction\nFire! was introduced in 1987, so a rulesheet is a little overdue.  I\nwrote this rulesheet because one didn't exist, and since this game is a mild\ndeparture on the traditional pinball machine layout (no pop bumpers, no drop\ntargets, no lane change) I figured a rulesheet would be beneficial to anyone\ntrying to master this game.  \"Fire!\" is a trademark of Williams.  This\nrulesheet is public domain (free).\n\nSince this is my first rulesheet, it may suck.  Be that as it may,\nremember -  What did you pay for it!?!?  Please feel free to email me if\nyou find any typos, spelling errors, or mistakes involving the rules and\ngameplay in this rulesheet, or if there is anything that you think I should\nadd to it.  That being said, on with the show.\n\nDescription\nThe best way to start off one of these things is to describe the game's\nlayout.  So, that's what I'll do.  To begin with, we'll start at the plunger,\nwhich is of the manual type and in the traditional (right side) location.\nThe shooter lane goes just more than half-way up the playfield, where it\ncomes to a one-way gate that is angled about 45 degrees, so that if one\nwere to shoot the ball and just go through this gate, the ball would roll\nback and the gate would deflect it down towards the flippers.\n\nThe skill shot is in the area just above the shooter lane's one-way\ngate, and consists of five roll-over sensors and a stand-up target at the\nvery end.  These are spaced evenly, and labeled so that the first one from\nthe gate is 20,000 points, then 10,000, then 30,000, then 100,000, then\n5,000, and then finally the stand-up is worth 1,000 points.  The object\nhere is to shoot the ball just far enough to roll over the 100,000 sensor,\nand then it rolls back and falls into play.  The highest sensor the ball\nrolls over is the score you get, and if you shoot too hard, the ball hits the\nstand-up target at the top and you only get 1,000 points.\n\nNext, we'll look down between the flippers and see the fire plug,\nwhich is a little round peg that pops up during different parts of the game\nto prevent a drain.  More on this later.  Next, you can see that the\nflippers are of standard size, and just above them on either side are the\nslingshot kickers, again in the traditional layout.  Outside of these you\nwill see little rails that separate the areas outside the kickers into an\ninlane and outlane on the left and right sides of the playfield.\n\nNow look at the top of the playfield, and you will see in the center a\nlarge building that is for our purposes shaped mostly rectangular.  In the\nfront of this main building in the middle is a little ramp that has a ladder\npainted on it that can drop level into the playfield.  I'll refer to this as\nthe \"Ladder Ramp\".  There is a turnaround that forms a \"U\" behind the ladder\nramp, with an entrance on each side of the ladder ramp.  There is an insert\nlamp for each side of the turnaround to show when it is \"lit\".  More on\nthis later.  If the ladder ramp is in the usual down position (flush with\nthe playfield) then shooting a ball up the middle would hit a bumper peg and\nbe deflected back down.  If the ramp is up, the ball can be shot through the\n\"window\", in which it will either go to the left or to the right on the upper\nloop.  When this happens, a ball (or \"Fireman\") is locked (\"trapped\") into\neither the East or West building.  Immediatly to either side of the ladder\nramp are little side buildings with 3 stand-up targets on each.  Each target\nhas a insert lamp that looks like a fire.  Just below these targets are the\nupper slingshot kickers, and on the outside of these kickers are the \"save\nthe girl\" ramps.  These start about two/thirds the way up the playfield and\nextend all the way to the back of the playfield and at the top they are\nraised up so that the ball almost touches the playfield glass.  They have a\nsensor at the top to register a hit.\n\nOutside of the \"save the girl\" ramps is the \"main loop\" ramp.  This\nstarts from outside of the entrances of the \"save girl\" ramps and goes up\ntowards the back of the playfield, under the \"save the girl\" ramps, and into\nthe sides (through) the main building.  The entrances to this loop can raise\nand lower, so if they are in the initial position (up), the ball is on the\nlower loop of \"the loop\", so a shot into the left side would come out on the\nright side and vice-versa.  If the entrances are both down, the same thing\nhappens, only the ball goes on the upper part/loop.  Only if one side is up\nand the other is down, if the ball goes into the side that is down, it will\nfollow around the top loop and go across the other side's entrance, which is\nin the up position, so the ball continues along a little railing and is\ndropped into a building, where it is locked in the same place it would be\nlocked if the ball went through the window of the building.  If the ball goes\nunder a raised entrance when the other side's entrance is down, the down side\nentrance will raise to allow the ball to come back out as if both sides were\nraised (just like the initial position) and then that entrance will go back\ndown.  Whew!!\n\nNow, the only part left of the playfield to describe are the buildings\nwhere the ball is locked from the loop.  These are about half-way up the\nplayfield.  On the inside sides of these buildings, are more stand-up\ntargets (three each side) that have the little fire-looking insert lights.\nThe building on the left, when it is releasing a locked ball(s), shoots them\nout of the upper right corner through a one-way gate just above that\nbuilding's top-most stand-up target.  The one on the right released locked\nballs through the bottom, which drops each ball into the right side inlane.\nOh yeah, just in case you didn't already know, the left side building is the\n\"West\" building, and the right one the \"East\" building.  Ok boys and girls?\n\nGame Play\nOk, after the ball is plunged into the game and comes out of the\nskillshot area, it will head directly for the flippers.  Good thing the\nfire plug is up at the beginning of each ball!  If not, a good percentage\nof balls would drain immediately..  At random during the game, different\ngroups of the fire targets (stand-up targets with the fire looking\ninsets) will be lit.  They always lite in their groups of three.  When a\nfire target is hit, the corresponding insert lamp goes out, thus putting\nout that fire.  You have to put out all three targets in the bank to put\nout the fire \"group\".  Also, sending the ball through the loop will spot\n(put out) one of the lit fire targets.\n\nStarting from when you plunge a ball into play, one group will be lit,\nand the 10x lamp will be blinking (of the upper column of 10x, 7x, 5x, 3x,\n& 2x.  The rest will be lit solid.)  After a while, if you haven't put the\nfirst group of fire targets out, the 10x will turn off and the 7x will start\nblinking, and so on.  Now you get less for putting out that fire, and at\nrandom either another fire will start up in addition to the existing one,\nor if you get lucky, the machine will pick the same fire you already had lit,\nso you don't have to put out an additional fire to avoid the decreasing fire\nbonus light.  Either way, it is always good to put out the fires as soon as\npossible.  The longer you take, the bonus column will show less of a multi-\nplyer until you get none.  If you already put the first fire out, the timer\nwill reset, and another will light (the column will stay on 10x.)\n\nTo get multiball, you must put out all the fires on the building that\nyou want to lock a ball into.  Once you put out the building that was on\nfire, you'll see the opposite side ramp drop down for entry into the building\nyou just put out.  Shot the ball up that ramp onto the top loop to lock the\nball into the freshly extinguished building.  Now try to lock a ball into\nthe other side's building using the same technique.  Once you have locked a\nball in each building, the ramps should both be up, and the \"Lights Rescue\"\nlamps should be lit.  Fire a ball through the lower loop to raise the ladder\nand then get a shot through the window to start multiball.  Once multiball\nis acheived, you must put out all lit fires with at least two balls in play\nto get the Million point award.\n\nTo get an extra ball, you must go up each \"save the girl\" ramp once.\nThen, one of the two \"save the girl\" ramps will be randomly lit.  To get the\nextra ball, you must again hit the target at the end of the lit \"save the\ngirl\" ramp.\n\nEach time you go through the turnaround at the top of the playfield by\nthe ladder ramp, the fire plug is raised for a few seconds (operator adjusts\nthis) to keep the ball from draining.  If one or both sides of the turnaround\nare lit, enter the turnaround from the lit side to raise the bonus level\nmultiplier.  Additionally, sending the ball through the turnaround when it is\nlit will raise the ladder for a window shot.  Each time the ladder is raised,\nit will stay up for an operator set period of time.  You can hear the seconds\ntick away and see the \"Rescue Shot!  Break Window\" lamp flash as your time\nof having a raised ramp diminishes.  Hitting any slingshot kicker will cycle\naround which turnaround lamp is lit.  Also, the kickers cycle which extra\nball light is lit.  When the bonus multiplyer is on 10x, if you get another\nlit turnaround shot, the outlane \"Special\" lites will be lit.\n\nBugs/Tricks/Easter Eggs\nThe only trick I have figured out so far is this:  When you have the ball in\nthe shooter lane, you can lightly plunge it so the ball moves through the\none-way gate just enough to trigger the 20k sensor, but not enough to go all the\nway through the gate.  This way the ball can register the score and go back\ndown the shooter lane for another attempt.  But, unless you're good at this,\nit could be a sure fire way for you to blow your skill shot.  Additionally,\nthe more time you waste fooling around with the shooter lane, the more time\nyou waste on whatever fires are lit, and so your point values for those\nbuildings will be less.\n\nThe only bug I've found using the Revision 2 game roms was that when\nyou are getting ready to plunge your final ball, the display will show what\nscore you have to attain to get a replay in the bottom left display, but it\nwill keep toggling between displaying that and something else in that display.\nAll the while there is an empty display on the top right that could be used\nto show this information, thus no toggling between the messages would be\nneeded.  Hopefully, Rom Revision 3 (currently the latest Revision and probably\nthe final) fixes this.  Anyone know?\n\nI don't know if this is an easter egg or not, but could Fire! be Williams\nfirst game to have cows in it?  When you start a game, there is a cow mooing\nloudly in the background.  I guess this is supposed to be the famous cow that\nstarted the great fire in Chicago in the old days, hence the theme of this\nmachine.  I could be wrong however!\n\nQuotes\n\n M = Male voice\n W = Woman's voice\n C = Cow\n H = Horse\n\n\n\n M-\"Save the Girl\"\n M-\"Yah!\"\n M-\"I can't!\"\n M-\"Move the hose!!!\"\n M-\"Bring up the ladder!\"\n M-\"Break the window!\"\n M-\"Arghh!!

This game definitely deserves a few words of history and praise.\nWhat can I say?  What a game!  Truly one of designer Steve Ritchie's legends which graced arcades and gaming locations across the country during what many call the \"second golden era\" of pinball- the early 1980's.  In regard to Ritchie's other pinball creations, Firepower took second place only to his masterpiece, Black Knight, which toppled Firepower from it's top position on the earnings list in 1980 when it was released only months later in the same year.\nI consider Firepower to be my favorite game of all time.  Why?  Well, partly due to the fantastic game play, sounds, and lighting effects, but also for sentimental reasons.  This is the game I grew up playing the most.  When my pre-teen lawn-mowing income determined how much pinball I could play, Firepower was the game that got most of my quarters, probably because I was able to keep the ball in play longer than on other games.  And who could walk away from the excitement on the playfield?  It always kept me coming back.\nFirepower was released in March of 1980.  A staggering 17,410 units were produced.  It was the first solid-state Multi-Ball pinball machine, and was the only Level 6 Williams pinball to use ALL SIX game ROM chip locations on the MPU board.  Some would call it ahead of it's time.  The designers definitely squeezed all they possibly could out of the electronics in this game to make it what it is.\nFirepower features 3-ball Multi-Ball play.  The playfield has two flippers, in the standard location at the bottom center of the playfield.  Four pop bumpers, three eject holes, and one spinner.\nIt also has both sound and voice for it's audio effects.  The voice effects in these early Williams solid-state pinballs were always my favorite, and still are, even though competitor Bally had at the time what many consider a \"better\" voice system with their Squawk & Talk board.  But I think it's the slightly-rudimentary, computer-generated-sounding voice in these games that gives them more personality- it's more like the game itself is speaking to you rather than just playing back someone's recorded voice.  Just adds more character to the game.\n\nBasic Game Objectives:\n- Score center targets to light eject holes to lock balls.  Lock 3 balls to start Muti-Ball play.\n- Complete F-I-R-E rollover lanes to advance bonus multiplier and light Extra Ball.\n- Collect Firepower Bonus to light outlanes for Special.\n\nPlayfield Overview:\nFirepower's playfield shows many features that lent themselves to the designs found in some of Steve Ritchie's later games.  At first glance, the playfield seems to be something of a cross between \"High Speed\" and \"Terminator 2\".  The following is a brief description of the playfield features, following the ball's path from the plunger, going counter-clockwise around the playfield.  All scoring and awards described are based on the game's \"factory\" default settings:\n\nPlunger Lane\n\nThe plunger lane is located on the right side of the playfield, as usual.  It releases the ball into play near the top of the playfield after the ball leaves a one-way gate at the top of the lane.  The player can attempt one of two types of shots from the plunger lane.  A light plunge will allow the ball to enter immediately into play on the playfield, dropping it straight down to the flippers.  A 'normal' plunge will cause the ball to continue out of the plunger lane, curving to the left, and entering the top center area of the playfield above the four F-I-R-E rollover lanes (see F-I-R-E Rollover Lanes below).\n\n\nLower Right Lock:\nThe Lower Right Lock, or eject hole, is located on the inside edge of the curve from the plunger lane to the upper-center of the playfield (above the four F-I-R-E rollover lanes).  The ball passes behind this lock as it makes it's way to the rollover area.  This lock will capture a ball, when lit, and awards 10,000 points.  When not lit, the hole scores 1,000 points.  There is a star-rollover button located in front of this lock, which also scores 1,000 points when activated.\nUpper Right Lock:\n\nThis lock is located just above the curve that exits into the F-I-R-E rollover area, at the top of the playfield.  A ball being shot into this area (from the plunger or from flippers at the bottom of the playfield) will pass along the curve and below the Upper Right Lock, entering the area above the F-I-R-E rollover lanes.  In short, a ball cannot be shot into the Upper Right Lock when it enters from the right.  It can only land in this lock by being shot up the Left Spinner lane (see below), or by a lucky or skillful rebound off one of the posts at the top of the F-I-R-E rollover lanes.  Scoring for the Upper Right Lock is the same as the Lower Right Lock- 10,000 points when lit, and 1,000 points when not lit.\nF-I-R-E Rollover Lanes:\n\nFour rollover lanes are located at the top center of the playfield.  Each lane is marked with one letter of the word FIRE.  The Lane-Change feature in the game allows the player to rotate any lit rollover lanes from left to right, one position at a time, by pressing the right flipper button.  This makes collecting all four rollover lanes much easier.  Completing all four rollover lanes lights the \"FIRE\" insert (in center of playfield), and awards a bonus multiplier- 2X, 3X, 4X, and 5X.  When 5X has been collected, completing all four rollover lanes again lights Extra Ball (see Lower Right Standup Targets below).\nBalls can enter the area above the F-I-R-E rollover lanes from the left or the right.  Each entrance features a one-way gate that will prevent the ball from leaving the area without going through one of the rollover lanes.\nEach rollover lane (lit or unlit) scores 1,000 points.\nPop Bumper Area:\n\nFour pop bumpers are positioned strategically below the F-I-R-E rollover lanes, in a square formation.  The left two pop bumpers are actually located slightly higher up the playfield than the right pop bumpers, which I think really helps the ball action in that area.  Most Firepower games will exhibit very good response and ball action from the pop bumpers.\nPop bumpers, when not lit, award 100 points each.  When lit, pop bumpers award 1,000 points each.  Pop bumpers are lit by completing all six Center Stand-Up Targets, located just below the pop bumpers, in two banks of three targets each (see below.)  On first completion of the Stand-Up Targets, two pop bumpers are lit, one left, and one right- one above and one below.  These will alternate as they are hit.  On second completion of the Stand-Up Targets, the other two unlit pop bumpers will be lit, so all four are lit.\nRebound switches around the pop bumper area score 50 points.  The sounds associated with these switches, and the sounds associated with pop bumper activation, make for some neat sound effects when the ball is in this area.\nA single \"bullseye\" stand-up target is located in the top-center pop bumper area- between the \"I\" and \"R\" rollover lanes.  Scoring for this target is often misunderstood by players, due to the three lamp inserts located directly below it.  The target actually scores 1,000 points.  The three lamp inserts below it (mounted vertically on the playfield) are marked 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000, from bottom to top.  These inserts actually indicate the bonus points awarded when the player completes F-I-R-E and POWER (see Lower Right Stand-Up Targets below.)  They do not in fact pertain to the bullseye target.  I have often wondered if the combination of the stand-up target and these inserts were originally designed for some other award, but have not been able to confirm this.  The layout of these two items certainly doesn't seem too logical, so it's perhaps possible that points or award(s) associated with the stand-up target were changed in the game before it was released.  Which leads us to....\n\nCenter Stand-Up Targets:\n\nThis is probably the \"heart\", and most interesting area of Firepower's playfield, and game play.  Two banks of three stand-up targets are mounted here, just below the four pop bumpers (one bank of stand-ups below each column of two pop bumpers).  Again, like the pop bumpers, these two banks are slightly offset, and pointed slightly inward toward the center of the playfield.  The left bank is mounted slightly higher than the right bank.\nTargets are marked \"1\" through \"6\" by orange arrow inserts on the playfield in front of the targets themselves.  Completing one bank of targets lights the Left Kickback in the left outlane (see below).  Completing both banks of targets will light two of the three ball-lock eject holes (Left Lock, Upper Right Lock, and Lower Right Lock), and will also light the spinner in the Left Spinner Lane (see below) for 1,000 points.  Completing all six stand-up targets a second time will light the remaining lock.\nEach stand-up target awards 1,000 points, whether lit (collected), or not lit (not collected).\nInitially, the game was designed to use drop targets in place of the stand-up targets.  In fact, some prototype Firepower games still exist with the original drop targets in place.  Some early production Firepower games actually have the wiring for the drop targets still in place (but taped up).  The software for Firepower supports the use of drop targets, whether they, or the wiring for them, is in place or not, so it is possible to \"retrofit\" your Firepower to use drop targets in place of the stand-up targets.  Details of this retrofit have been covered in detail in Ted Estes' Firepower Retrofit document, so I won't cover them here, but his document can be found in various locations on the Internet.\nLeft Spinner Lane:\n\nThis lane is located in the upper left corner of the playfield.  It actually starts about mid-way up the playfield, and hooks sharply to the right at the top of the playfield, sending the ball through a one-way gate, across the top of the F-I-R-E rollover area, and toward the Upper Right Lock.  This is the shot to make when attempting to lock a ball in the Upper Right Lock, and with a crisp shot off the right flipper, can be very gratifying when the spinner hits maximum RPMs and the ball slams into the lock.  Very nice shot, and typical Steve Ritchie \"flow\"!  Experienced players will note that this is virtually the identical shot found on Terminator 2, but without the spinner.\nThe spinner in this lane scores 100 points, or 1,000 points when lit.  Complete all six Center Stand-Up Targets to light the spinner.\nLeft Lock:\n\nThe third of the three lock eject holes, this lock is located just behind (to the left) of the start of the Left Spinner Lane.  Rules for this lock are the same as other locks, as described above.  This lock also feature a star rollover-button in front of it, like the Lower Right Lock.\nLeft Kickback:\n\nAnother Steve Ritchie signature classic, this feature comprises the left outlane, and is dubbed, the \"Shield\" on this game.  The \"Shield\" is lit by completing either bank of the Center Stand-Up Targets (whether they've been completed already or not), and awards 1,000 points, whether lit or unlit.  When lit, the Shield will kick the ball back into play, and become inactive.  Complete center stand-up targets again to re-light the Shield.\n\nSlingshots, Flippers, Return Lanes, Outlanes:\nAh, the standard layout here- which I do like.  Traditional.  Two lanes behind each slingshot bumper- an outlane and a flipper return lane.  Return lanes award 1,000 points, or 3,000 points when lit (see Lower Right Stand-Up Targets).  Outlanes score 1,000 points, or Special when lit.  Special is lit by collecting Firepower Bonus (see below) three times.\nLeft outlane of course features a kickback (see above).  Slingshot bumpers score 10 points each.  The right flipper will activate the Lane-Change feature for the F-I-R-E rollover lanes (see above).  'Nuff said.\nLower Right Stand-Up Targets:\n\nAgain, very typical of Steve Ritchie playfield layouts- the lone 3-bank of stand-up targets to the above-right of the right slingshot.  Seen on other games like Terminator 2, and Getaway.  On Firepower, these targets, when completed, award \"POWER\", light the \"POWER\" insert in the center of the playfield, and light both flipper return lanes for 3,000 points each.  These targets will also award the Extra Ball, when lit (see F-I-R-E Rollover Lanes).\nThis completes our tour of the playfield....\nFirepower Bonus:\nCompleting both \"FIRE\" (F-I-R-E rollover lanes) and POWER (Lower Right Stand-Up Targets), awards the Firepower bonus, which is a value of 10,000, 30,000, or 50,000 points, as indicated by the insert lights in the center of the pop bumper area.  After collecting the 50,000 award, the outlanes are both lit for Special.\n\nBonus Points:\n\nBonus can range from 1,000 points to 29,000 points, and can be multiplied from 1X to 5X.  Bonus points are accumulated by major targets, when initially collected (such as F-I-R-E rollovers, unlit Center Stand-Up Targets, etc.)  Bonus multipliers are collected by completing the F-I-R-E rollover lanes.\n\nMulti-Ball:\n\nMulti-Ball play is awarded after locking all three balls in locks, or eject holes, on the playfield.  All three balls are then released into play.  The game does a great countdown effect with the displays, lights, and sound when Multi-Ball is collected.  Very neat effect.\nUnfortunately, Multi-Ball on this game is a bit shallow.  If you're used to playing newer games that have a jackpot or other strategy during Multi-Ball, then you'll notice the difference when you hit Multi-Ball on Firepower.  Really no object to it once all three balls are in play.  Just keep the flippers going and enjoy the action, really!\n\nStrategies:\n\n- My personal favorite: Go for Extra Ball.  This can be pretty tough on Firepower, however, depending on the way the game is setup/adjusted.  By factory default, one must achieve 5X, then collect the Extra Ball, all in one ball.  Can be tough.  On more liberally-adjusted games, bonus multipliers can be carried over, thus making the Extra Ball more easily obtainable.\n- Keep the Shield lit.  A must on any Steve Ritchie game with an outlane kickback.  Actually pretty easy on Firepower.  Just keep whacking the center stand-up targets to get the Shield re-activated.\n- Go for bonus X.  Always ensures bigger points.\n- Remember that center stand-up targets are always worth 1,000 points each, whether lit or unlit (flashing), so if you can't make the shot you want, slap the center targets for some easy points.\n- Keep in mind that most features can be more easily obtained during Multi-Ball, for the simple reason that there is 2 to 3 times the playfield activity (depending on how many balls you can keep in play).  This may be the most comprehensive of strategies- go for Multi-Ball.  As there's really no Jackpot or other strategy employable during Multi-Ball, use it for points and feature collection.\nAs always, Happy Pinballing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Firepower", "possible_shots": "Plunger Lane, Lower Right Lock, Upper Right Lock, F-I-R-E Rollover Lanes, Pop Bumper Area, Center Stand-Up Targets, Left Spinner Lane, Left Lock, Left Kickback, Slingshots, Flippers, Return Lanes, Outlanes, Lower Right Stand-Up Targets", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/firepower.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Firepower", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I retain any and all rights\nto this guide.  You may even take this guide and change it or use it in\nother manners and then redistribute it as long as it remains freely\ndistributable and this policy is stated at the beginning of it.  No charge\nmay ever be made for distributing this guide and no one may make a profit\nfrom it.  Please send any comments/updates/suggestions/corrections.\n\nFish Tales is probably a registered trademark of Williams Electronics, etc.\netc.  So there.\n\nNo holds are barred in this Guide.  I'm going to talk about EVERYTHING I\nknow about.  If you really want to learn all the undocumented features\nyourself, then stop reading!\n\nImportant Things\nThis section describes key elements and/or shots to be made in Fish Tales.\nThey will be constantly referred to in the play discussion.\n\n\n Rod  This is the auto-plunging device on Fish Tales.  It's a little fishing\nrod handle with a button on the top of it.  Hit the button to launch\nthe ball.  You also use the button during video mode to launch\ntorpedos.  Really.\n\n Autocast  This is a timed device designed to protect you from instant\ndrains.  While it is flashing, you will get any ball back that\nyou lose, instantly.  If the game sees it hit an outlane\nmicroswitch, you'll get the next one before it even finishes\ndraining!  If you can death-save the ball you lost, you can have\na mini-multiball.  It is on briefly when a ball is launched from\nthe Reel during a multi-player game, even though it isn't lit.\n\n Long Cast  This is the right looping shot, exactly like the Chase Loop in\nTerminator 2.  Making this shot when lit scores million+, and\nlights the next thing on the captive ball.  If this shot is not\nlit, then the upper left gate will be closed, and the ball will\ngo into one of the LIE lanes.\n\n LIE lanes  Spell LIE to increase your bonus multiplier up to 7x.  After\n7x, each LIE made will be worth 5M, 10M, 15M, then 20M for then\non (until you lose the ball (unless you had bonus held)).  Don't\nforget you can change which lanes are lit with either flipper\nbutton, so you should never repeat a letter.\n\n Boat  This is the inclined plastic figure right in the center of the game.\nThere are 3 shots:  The left ramp, the right ramp, and the captive\nball.  Because it is inclined, it is harder to hit the ball than on\nmost other games with one (like Earthshaker).  Any one of these 3\nshots counts as a \"boat shot\" during Rock the Boat.\n\n Captive ball  The captive ball is trapped in the middle of the boat.  A\ndead-on shot will send it up to the top, where there is a\ntarget that it can trigger.  If you don't hit it hard enough,\nit won't hit the switch.  Only hitting the switch has any\neffect and counts as a captive ball hit.\n\n Eject hole  This shot is equivalent to the Escape Route shot on T2.  You\nusually get it by shooting up the left side, through the\nspinner, and into the hole.  However, whatever it is lit for,\nyou can still get it if it just happens to plop in there (if\nit's bouncing around the LIE lanes, for example).  This is\nwhere you collect the regular Jackpot, the Fish Finder, and\nVideo Mode.\n\n Fish Finder  If you hit the Fish Finder, you are given (\"randomly\") one of\nseveral awards from points to multiball to light extra ball.\n\n Video Mode  Lit by hitting the 2nd value on the captive ball.  Shooting the\neject hole will start it, and you have to shoot boats with\nwater skiers going across the screen at 3 different distances.\n\n Stringers  There are 2 targets on the left and right sides near the\nslingshots which have a 3-part fish in front of them.  Hitting\neither target spots one of the segments, and a whole fish lights\na Stringer, which is one of the 4 big fish with lights in them\non the lower part of the playfield, just under the boat.  This\nalso lights the spinner for \"Stretch the Truth\" for 10-15\nseconds.  4 Stringers starts the Feeding Frenzy.\n\n Spinner  Located on the left lane shot.  Note that any spinner award\n(Stretch the Truth or Monster Fish) just needs to barely get it to\ngo around to get credit.  Also note that hitting the spinner from\nthe wrong direction (as from a Long Cast) DOESN'T count.\n\n Stretch the Truth  When lit, scores 1 tale (for end-of-ball bonus, and\nthe current set of 4 is displayed under the stringers)\nper Stringer you have hit before the award times out.\nThe value of your fish ranges from 0-5M per fish.  4\ntales starts a 30 second Rock the Boat.\n\n Feeding Frenzy  There are 4 purple fish you need to hit.  One on each of\nthe ramp shots, one along the Long Cast, and one at the\nspinner.  You have 15 seconds to hit a fish for 5M points.\nDoing so gives you another 15 seconds to hit the next one,\netc., until you have 15 seconds to hit the last fish for\n20M points (a total of 35M).\n\n Rock the Boat  For a certain amount of time (20 seconds from the captive\nball award; 30 seconds for 4 tales), each boat shot counts\n10M (including U-turns).\n\n Monster Fish  Right under the boat is a string of 6 fish (a \"school\" of\nfish - look closely!).  Each time you make a LIT ramp shot,\nyou light another fish.  Getting all 6 lights the spinner\nfor the Monster Fish award, which is a hurry-up award.\n\n Caster's Club  A fairly hard-to-hit shot where you shoot balls to lock\nthem.  The balls don't even stay here; the game kicks them\nup a habitrail which leads to the reel all the way on the\nleft side of the game.\n\n Reel  Nothing really important, except this is where balls are stored.  It\ncan spin to accept new balls, or to let a ball out to have it kicked\nback into play.  Balls kicked out go around the top of the machine\nand out a habitrail aimed for your left flipper.\n\nWhat Lights What\nThe left return lane ALWAYS lights the Long Cast.  (The light is always on.)\nAlso, shooting the ball up the right loop while Long Cast is NOT lit will\nlight Long Cast (seemingly until you make the shot).  After making a Long\nCast or lighting it from the left return lane, it will time out after 10-15\nseconds or so.  (So I'm not TOTALLY sure...)  The first Long Cast you make\nscores 1M points, then 2M, etc. maxing out at 5M.  As stated, each long cast\nlights the next highest value on the captive ball that isn't already lit.\nYou can light all of the values before collecting any of them if you wanted.\nIf your current value is about to time out, and you go through the left\nreturn lane, it will relight for the full amount of time again, and KEEP the\ncurrent value.\n\nThe right return lane lights Fish Finder when lit.  It starts the game lit,\nand will remain lit until the Fish Finder is collected.  When you go over\nthe microswitch, you have around 15-20 seconds to shoot the eject hole.  If\nyou get it, the right return lane will go off.  To relight it, spell LIE\n(this is non-cumulative; i.e. you can't spell LIE 3 times and expect to get\n3 Fish Finders in a row).  The right return lane will NOT be lit during\nmultiball and if Video Mode is lit.  If it goes off for one of those\nreasons, it will come back on when it can.\n\nThe left and right ramps start the game lit, so you get 1 \"free\" shot at\neach side.  After that, shooting the right ramp OR going through the right\nreturn lane will light the left ramp, and vice versa.  The point is to\nalternate ramps, shooting the left ramp from the right flipper and the right\nramp from the left flipper.  It is fairly easy to backhand the ball up the\nramps too, so if the left ramp is lit and the ball is on the left flipper,\nyou should be able to make it up.  Depending on the machine, it may even be\neasier to backhand!  Making 6 LIT ramp shots lights the Monster Fish.\n\nThe two Stringer fish targets are lit at the start of the game, too.  After\ncompleting the first one, it'll stay unlit until you complete the other one.\nThe targets then alternate sides upon completion of each Stringer.\n\nYou can light the extra ball 1 of 2 ways:  Hitting the Fish Finder, or as\nthe 4th award on the captive ball.  The extra ball is just to the left of\nthe Caster's Club, and is probably the hardest extra ball target to hit\nyet.  You may THINK you have a shot at it from the left flipper, but the\nbottom right of the Boat is in the way.  The only way to aim for it is to\nbackhand it from the right flipper, and even then it's not terribly easy.\nDepends on your machine.  The one I played on the most you had to make an\nabsolutely direct hit on it because I think it may have been a little\nflaky, but I also have played on one where it wasn't too bad.\n\nTo light the special, you have to complete the captive ball awards (get\ninstant multiball), then hit the captive ball a certain number of times\nafter that, usually (and probably is the default) 4 more hits.  The special\nis collected on the outlanes, is always lit on both of them, and stays lit\nthe entire game.  However, you have to light the special ON THAT BALL, or\nyou lose the chance to light it until completing the next set of captive\nball awards.\n\nThe Stretch the Truth spinner shot usually shots all 5 lights lit, but\nevery time you spell LIE, the lowermost light will go out (until only the 5x\nis left).  The spinner will then just circulate between the lit choices.\nThanks to all the people who pointed this out to me, even though I figured\nit out the day I originally posted this message!  Oh well.  %)\nMisc. Scoring\nThe Fast Cast is scored by hitting the Caster's Club (or the drop target\nwhen it's supposed to be up) right after a Long Cast or ball launch (not an\nAutocast, though).  The first Fast Cast is worth 2M and goes up 1M each\ntime you get it.  Fast Cast maxes out at 10M.\n\nThe captive ball awards are:\n\n\n  Hold Bonus (1M) - self-explanatory; holds your bonus and multiplier.\n  Video Mode (2M) - lights the eject hole for Video Mode.\n  Rock the Boat (3M) - Rock the Boat for 20 seconds.\n  Light Extra Ball (5M) - What do you think?\n  Instant Multiball (10M) - immediately starts multiball.\n\n\nNote that you can only get one award per hit, no matter how many are lit.\nThe numbers in parentheses are the amount of points you get for that award.\nAlso, whether or not the captive ball is lit for the next award, hitting it\nscores \"Grab Yer Gear\" which is 1M x the highest lit award (excluding\ninstant multiball, which is Sell Yer Gear as described below).  If nothing\nis lit (as is the case for the ball after completing the captive ball), you\nget 500K.\n\nAfter getting Instant Multiball, the captive ball becomes worth 5M points\nper hit, going up 500K per hit (so the 3rd hit is worth 6M).  The maximum\nvalue on the Sell Yer Gear award is 10M.\n\nThe Fish Finder awards are:\n\n\n  Light Extra Ball\n  Super Jets Lit - each jet bumper (the 3 under LIE) scores 500K!\n  Instant Multiball\n  Inc. Captive Ball - lights the next value, like hitting Long Cast.\n  Bonus x - lights the next bonus x value.\n  1-5 million - varies each time.\n\n\nFish Tales is EXTREMELY FAIR about the Fish Finder.  If you keep hitting\nit, and you haven't gotten the extra ball from it all game, it will\neventually light it no matter how well you are doing when it does.  It will\nnever light bonus x if you are at 7x already.  Nor will it award the captive\nball increase if it's already maxed (at instant multiball).\n\nThe first Monster Fish you get will start at 20M and work its way down by\n100K each 1/10th of a second, stopping at 5M.  At 5M, you have 5 more\nseconds to try to get it.  If you don't get it, it stays at its current\nvalue the next time 'round.  If you DO get it (no matter when or for how\nmuch), the next time it'll be worth 10M more, up to a maximum of 50M.  The\namount per 1/10th second the score decreases goes up too, by 50K.  There is\nsome time before the countdown actually begins, so it IS possible to get the\nfull award (unlike, say, Super Death Star in Star Wars where you can never\never get the full 50M, which IMHO is totally stupid).\n\nThe 6 ramps leading up to the Monster Fish are worth 500K, 1M, 1.5M, etc.,\nup to 3M.  So lighting a Monster Fish is worth 10.5M.\n\nIf you make a ramp shot that doesn't quite have enough uumph to make it all\nthe way up a ramp and it comes down the other side, you get 1M points for a\n\"U-turn.\"  The U-turn is a valid shot for Rock the Boat!\n\nEach fish you've caught (hitting the Stringers) awards 250K bonus at the end\nof each ball, cumulative through the game.  Each tale told (hitting Stretch\nthe Truth) scores 500K at the end of the ball for every ball.\n\nThere is a bonus cap of 3M for any given ball.  Of course, this can be\nmultiplied by 7, for a total of 21M, plus how many fish and tales you have.\n\nIf you get hold bonus, then everything is held over to the next ball.  If\nyou had 7x bonus, then whatever value the LIE lanes were when you drained is\nthe value they are worth the next ball.\n\nDuring Video Mode, each ship closest to you that you hit gets you 500K, each\nship in the middle distance scores 1M, and each ship farthest away scores\n1.5M.  Be sure to lead your targets a little bit.  You have 20 seconds and\n20 torpedos.  Always go for the far boats, since you need to hit a certain\nnumber of them to get the extra ball to come out (it always comes out on the\nback row).  If you score between 15 and 19 hits (inclusive), you get a 10M\nbonus.  If you're a perfect 20/20, you get a 20M bonus!\n\nFish Tales can be configured to NOT give extra balls in video mode.  To\nreplace this, the game will offer you BS instead of EB.  The BS stands for\n\"Big Score\" and is worth 20M points.\n\nIf you were really fast in killing the back boats, and the EB/BS comes out,\nbut you MISS it, it may come out a SECOND time if you have enough time left\nfor that to happen.  Usually 1 boat will pass in the back before it comes\nout again.  So don't give up if you miss it, and hold on to that last\ntorpedo!\n\nYou can use the flippers to shoot off torpedoes as well as the rod button,\nthough the game won't tell you that you can do that.  It works a lot better,\nI think.  One person has written me that video mode will only last for that\nball on his machine.  However, on most it will stay on until you get it.\nVideo Mode can NOT be \"stacked,\" i.e. can only be lit once at a time.  If\nit's lit and you shoot the \"Light Video Mode\" again, you wasted it.\n\nThere's an amusing bug involving Video Mode...  If you tilt the ball, then\nit wanders up into the ball trap where Video Mode is lit, you'll be able to\nplay Video Mode, even though you're in tilt mode!  Cool.  :)  There's some\nother bugginess about tilt mode like being able to get the music to play (or\nkeep playing or something).  Nothing else major like the Video Mode bug,\nthough.\n\nDuring the course of the game, various things will swim by in the\nbackground (various fish, turtles, snails, mermaids...).  One of them is a\nskeleton fish.  If you slam on the cast button many times (like 10), then\nyou'll get \"Russ' Fishbone Bonus\" which scores 10 points.  It looks pretty\ncool, though.  NOTE:  Please do NOT post this to the Net!  Keep it to\nyourself if you've bothered to read this guide.  Consider it my present to\nyou for enduring it.  :)\nMultiball\nThe main goal in multiball is to get jackpots!  Nothing else really matters.\nHowever, some people have taken issue with this statement, and so I offer a\ncouple more ideas:  Hit the captive ball a lot at the start if it's lit and\nespecially if it's a drain shot on your machine.  Autocast will save you.\nAlso, Rock the Boat can be worth an awful lot of points if you can keep the\nballs going around the ramps.\n\nTo light a jackpot, shoot a ball into the Caster's Club.  The game yells \"Up\nto the top for jackpot!\"  Your next goal is to shoot the eject hole within\n15 seconds (there's a timer on there!) to score it.  The jackpots are worth\n20M, then 30M, then 40M.  The tackle box shows you which one you're on\n(flashing) and which ones you've gotten (lit).\n\nCompleting the Stringers during multiball adds 1M to the jackpot.  (Wow!)\nNotice, though, that the Stringers are also flashing during Feeding Frenzy\nand Rock the Boat.  I'm not sure what they do here, but I think they add 1M\nto the jackpot when they're completed as well.\n\nIf you have 3 balls out, the Caster's Club will flash for \"Doubles Jackpot.\"\nShooting another ball in here at this time does just that, and resets the\ntimer at 15 seconds.  If it times out, though, BOTH balls are shot back at\nyou and you have to start all over.  If you lose the third ball, then one\nball is shot back at you, and you shoot for a single jackpot.  Any other\nshots at the Caster's Club are blocked by the drop target (and it keeps\ncoming up).\n\nAfter getting all 3 jackpots in the tackle box, the fun really begins.  The\ncaptive ball becomes lit for the Super Jackpot, and I DO mean Super!  Every\ntime you hit the captive ball, you get 100M points, until multiball ends.\n\nDon't worry; you needn't get all jackpots in 1 multiball in order to get to\nthe super jackpot.  Whichever jackpot you are on is remembered through the\nwhole game.  If you lit the super jackpot, but never hit the captive ball,\nthen the next multiball the captive ball will still be lit for the next\nmultiball until you've hit it at least once.\n\nOf course, it'd be anticlimactic to have to go back to the 20M, 30M, 40M\njackpots, now, wouldn't it?  Well, after going through an entire jackpot\nsequence (i.e. you've gotten at least one SJ), all of the jackpots become\nworth minimum 2x their original value!  INCLUDING the captive ball super\njackpot!  And you can still double the jackpots, so you can make major\namounts of points on this game.  And it keeps increasing with each completed\nsequence.  The multiplier will go as high as 6x (yes, I've gotten a 600M\nsuper jackpot).  Why it goes up to 6 I know not (just seems like a strange\nnumber).\n\nIf you get a Super Jackpot when the next-to-last ball is registering in the\ntrough, you'll get an additional 100M for the SJ.  The reason for this is\nprobably because the jackpot multiplier kicks in as soon as the ball is\nregistered, but just before the final SJ points are awarded to you.  I don't\nknow that for sure, but a way to confirm it would be to see if getting a\n600M SJ gives you 700M or not.\n\nNote that during multiball, the Boat can still be hit for lighting the\nMonster Fish.  Always be listening for the distinctive roar the game makes\nif you're not paying very close attention how many ramp hits you have.  Also\nthe captive ball can be hit for whatever it's lit for, and it can still be\nadvanced via the Long Cast.\n\nOh - one other thing about multiball...  If you shoot a ball up each ramp at\nabout the same time (at any rate before the previous one hits the return\nlane), you get 5M points for a \"Double Cross.\"\n\"Properly-Set-Up Machines\"\nFish Tales is probably the least tolerant of any game to incorrect alignment\nof any kind.  On a lot of machines, there is a little bitty piece of rubber\nat the end of the left loop which, if the ball is traveling against the\nleft side as it usually does, will cause the ball to go straight down the\nmiddle of your flippers.  Also, the upper-left gate seems to cause a lot of\nproblems for people.  If you look closely, you can see that it is a one-way\ngate that should always allow the ball to go through from left to right.\nHowever, there is a little rod that the game can control and open the gate\nwhen it wants.  It should ONLY open for right-to-left shots when the Long\nCast is lit, or when you are launching a ball from the plunger (not\nnecessarily for an auto-launched ball during multiball, though).  If the\ngate is always open, this is not really a bad thing except that it makes it\na bit harder to get LIE, since the ball will never stop on its way around\nthe Long Cast.  HOWEVER, if the gate is always CLOSED, you are in big\ntrouble.  This is because you can't advance the value of the captive ball\nexcept to get lucky on the Fish Finder.  If your gate is always closed, or\nif the rubber at the end of the left lane is screwing your balls, then\ncomplain to your operator!  The game is not worth playing in these cases.\n\nAnother problem that I recently discovered is the Caster's Club drop target.\nThe game is supposed to be able to drop the target when it needs to.  When\ndoes it need to?  Well, for example, if you get instant multiball while it\nis up, it should go down to allow you to light the jackpot.  I've played a\ngame where the machine couldn't retract it, and it took 2 hits at the\nCaster's Club just to light a jackpot, then to double it, etc.  It is next\nto impossible to get a jackpot when this happens.  Out of 6 games, I\nmanaged 1.  It's hard enough to light it, but when the drop target goes up,\nit really hurts things.  THE ONLY TIME IT SHOULD COME UP is when you have\ngotten a jackpot during the last multiball or during multiball to block the\n2nd or 3rd ball from going into the Caster's Club when 2 or 3 balls are in\nplay.\nStrategies\nYou can usually get replays just by going for the Monster Fish bonuses.  If\nyou are good at the ramps and making the spinner shot, I highly recommend\nit.  But after the replay, you're going to have to go for multiball.\n\nAt any rate, if you have a Monster Fish lit, ALWAYS ALWAYS go for it.  If\nyou don't get it, the Fish value won't increase, and you'll be stuck right\nback where you just were.  Even if it's at 5M, try to get it because the\npotential for the next Fish is so great.  Of course, once you're at 50M, it\ndoesn't really matter as much if you miss the low value.\n\nWhen shooting for the Monster Fish, keep a careful eye on how many fish in\nthe school you have at the moment.  I NEVER shoot the final fish from the\nright flipper, because that wastes time (and points) needed to get the ball\nto the right flipper from the left.  Be sure to check your parity right\nafter making a ramp shot.  If you've just shot an even-numbered fish from\nthe right flipper, shoot something else from the left, like the Long Cast if\nthe captive ball isn't maxed out yet, the Caster's Club otherwise.\nLikewise, if you shot an odd-numbered fish from the left flipper, shoot for\nthe Fish Finder from the right.  Basically, keep careful track and you'll\nget the most Monster for your money.\n\nIf you're in multiball, try not to get Instant Multiball from the captive\nball.  It's a total waste, especially if you hit it right at the beginning\nof normal multiball.  If you have 2 balls locked and Instant Multiball lit,\nalways try for regular multiball first, since getting Instant Multiball\nmeans no locked balls after you lose them.\n\nIn Rock the Boat, go for the ramps and not the captive ball.  They're both\nmuch easier and much safer to shoot for, though obviously not as fast.  A\ncouple people have had the idea that backhanding the ball up the same ramp\nis a good idea.  I agree.  Backhanding the ramps is generally easier than\nshooting the far one, and you can get into a pretty good groove this way.\n\nOne person says that going for the captive ball on Rock the Boat is a good\nidea if you have both extra ball and multiball lit.  You risk a drain on the\nextra ball, but then you can hit the captive ball again for multiball and a\npotentially very rewarding Rock the Boat.\n\nFor Feeding Frenzy, don't get the Boat fish right away.  Try for the harder\nlooping shot ones first.  If you get low on time, shoot a Boat fish, then\nuse the next time to try for the looping ones again.  Note that you only\nneed to hit the Boat ramp sensor to get a fish and NOT the actual ramp\nsensor.  So if you got a U-turn, you'd get both Boat fish.  For the left\nfish, all you need is barely touch the spinner, and the right fish is the\nmicroswitch just before the LIE lanes.\n\nThe most important shot to master (and the one that needs the most practice)\nis the Caster's Club.  If you can get it down, then you'll do very well.  Of\ncourse the captive ball and Long Cast are very important in conjunction as\nwell.  There are several machines around that let you backhand the Caster's\nClub from the right flipper.  The only machine that I've been able to do\nthis on so far is a PAPA tournament machine.\n\nDon't aim for the Stringers.  Just let the ball hit them as it pleases.\nIf you have nothing better to do, or are really close to Feeding Frenzy or\nRock the Boat, then go ahead and try for them.  The reason I say this is\nbecause they are often drain shots.  Some people always go for them anyway\n(if nothing else than to get Biggest Liar!) for the Feeding Frenzy and Rock\nthe Boat.  Rock the Boat is usually worth it, but Feeding Frenzy is only\nworth 35M.  It's up to you.\n\nFind out which LIE lane the ball goes up the most from the Jets, and keep\nthat lane the unlit one.  (This is almost always the I, from what I've seen\nand heard.)  You'll be much more likely to complete it faster if you avoid\nduplicate letters this way.\nThanks!\nHere is a list of people to thank for comments/additions/corrections.

{"page_content": "Flash (Williams)\nby Patrick Morris \n\n\nFlash ushered a few firsts into the pinball world. As well as being the\nfirst to offer full coin door programming and auditing, it also had\n(limited) time based objectives and the now familiar (non-default)\ncrescendo background sound.\nFlash was also blatantly copied by another manufacturer and named Storm\nwith the main playfield feature being similarly called Super Storm.\n\nObjectives\nHit 5-bank drop targets to advance toward eject hole extra ball and\noutlane specials.\nHit 3-bank drop targets to advance toward Super Flash 50,000 points\n(default) OR extra ball (option)\n\nPlunger\nThe novel plunger shoots the ball diagonally across the centre of the\nplayfield around the sweeping curve through a non-turn gate to the bonus\nmultiplier lanes at the top of the playfield.\n\nBonus Multiplier Lanes\nMaking lanes 1-2-3 lights 2x bonus multiplier. Making lanes 1-2-3-4\nlights 3x bonus multiplier.

Dropping all 5 targets advances right hand eject\nhole value through 5,000 - 10,000 - extra ball. When 10,000 is lit,\nspinner and upper loop rollovers are lit for increased value. Completing\ntargets after eject hole is lit for extra hole lights both outlane\nspecials and makes all 5 targets worth 5,000 points for the duration of\nthat ball. Programming options allow for the 5,000 point light to be lit\ninitially (default) or not and for the current eject hole value to be\ncarried over to the next ball or not (default).\n\nCentre drop targets (3-bank)\nSequentially lit targets are worth 3,000 points instead of 1,000 points.\nCompleting the bank advances the completion value through Thunder -\nLighting - Tempest - Super Flash. When Super Flash is lit, all 3 targets\nare worth 3,000 points. Completing Super Flash scores 50,000 points\n(default) or extra ball and restarts the completion value. Programming\noptions allow for the current value to be carried to the next ball\n(default) or not.\n\nPlayfield features a third flipper halfway down right hand side ideally\npositioned for the 3-bank drop targets but can also be used to drop the\n5-bank targets or complete loops around the top of the playfield.\n\nFlipper return lanes are lit for increased points and bonuses by the\nlower right bulls-eye target.\n\n\nStrategy\nComplete the 5 bank targets as many times as possible to access the\nextra ball and outlane specials.\n\nThis also has the benefit of increasing the spinner value and upper\nrollovers which when combined with lighting the jet bumpers makes play\nin the upper playfield very profitable.\n\nUsing the upper flipper to loop the loop through the lit spinner with\nincreasing speed yields very rapid points but the layout makes each\nsuccessive loop more difficult.\n\nUpper flipper can also be used to drop 1,2 or all 3 of the 3-bank\ntargets and carry on through the loop or ricochet onto the 5-bank\ntargets. Dropping the 3-bank targets from the lower flipper often\nresults in the ball going down the left hand outlane.\n\nLeft flipper shots not only include the extra ball and high speed shots\nthrough the (lit) spinner but backhanded shots to ANY of the 5-bank targets.\n\nCompleting the lanes for multipliers is often left until after the jet\nbumpers are lit and successful nudging of the machine can bounce the\nball across the top on the lane dividers both downhill and up.\n\nNote: with some programming configurations it is possible to have more\nthan one extra ball in credit.\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Flash", "possible_shots": "5-bank drop targets, 3-bank drop targets, plunger, bonus multiplier lanes, jet bumpers, left hand drop targets (5-bank), centre drop targets (3-bank), third flipper, flipper return lanes", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/flash.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

The layout is terrific with only one\nsmall problem; the bloody center lane tends to cause balls to go straight\ndown the middle, often brushing the BED drop targets on the way. Perhaps\nan Indiana Jones type ball saver is needed (as least make it an\noption...)\n\nThe out lanes are ok. Compared to some other recent games they are\ngood. I found that the game would (at times) drain balls like there was no\ntomorrow, but mostly it played really well.\n\nThe sound, animation, lights, etc. (What I like to call 'the\npyrotechnics') is excellent too. Especially the (Super) Jackpots.\n\nEverything on our game was working correctly, so this rule sheet\nshould be correct in that aspect.\n\nConcurrency\n\nMost features in this game can run concurrently. I have started\nmultiball during Dino Frenzy, and Bowl-A-Rama. Modes can run concurrently\nand continue during multiball. I believe that this change is for the\nbetter, and congratulate the design team.\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nI'll start from between the flippers, and go in a clockwise direction.\n\n\n Rock Again  The ball saver and shoot again light. It is a normal globe\n(not a flasher) so it will probably last quite long...\n\n Left Flipper  The usual 'long' type.\n\n Left Sling Shot  A normal sling shot, but tiny.\n\n Left Inlane  Nothing new here either. It doesn't seem to light anything.\n\n Left Outlane  Has a 'Drain Shield' light that is lit with the Shell\ntargets. There is no kickback though, the ball is auto-plunged.\n\n Left Shell Targets  Three stand-up targets against the side of the\nmachine. Lighting all three will light Drain Shield on the outlanes\nfor a while.\n\n Time Machine Target  A single stand-up target facing the flippers. It\nhas three functions that occur in the following order:\n\n   Start the Time Machine mode ......... 'Time Machine'\n   Light Change Job on the right orbit . 'Job Change'\n   Start the Search mode ............... 'Help'\n\n\n\n Left Ramp  Like Judge Dredd's right ramp but on the other side of the\nplayfield. It feeds to the bottom loop which will be explained later.\n\n Dino/Frenzy target  Can be lit for 'Dino' and/or 'Frenzy' and is used\nfor the Dino Frenzy mode. This target is situated on the right of the\nentrance to the left ramp. There are 3 targets in total. One of these\ntargets is always lit to increase the value of Dino Frenzy.\n\n BED targets  Three drop targets parallel to the side of the cabinet\nwhich makes them hard to hit with the lower flippers. Knocking them\nall down adds letters to CONCRETE.\n\n Left Orbit  A fairly standard orbit that goes around the back of the\nmachine. If it is lit to Start Multiball, or the Bronto Crane, the\nball will be diverted to a popper. Otherwise it will continue to the\nbumpers, and often to the upper flipper.\n\n Dino/Frenzy target  Can be lit for 'Dino' and/or 'Frenzy' and is used\nfor the Dino Frenzy mode. This target is situated just to the right\nof the orbit. There are three targets in total. One of these targets\nis always lit to increase the value of Dino Frenzy.\n\n U-Turn  The best name I can think of. A short lane with a small loop at\nthe end. The roll-over for this shot is at the entrance to the loop,\nso it will be credited even if the shot didn't work. Keep in mind\nthat a hard shot put in here, will come out just as hard... This is\nthe Super Jackpot, and the 2x Playfield shot. When this is unlit, it\nawards an increasing million starting at 2 Million.\n\n Time Machine  Located in the upper left corner of the playfield is a\nspinning wheel. A ball put here will remain for quite a while. I did\nfind that balls tended to get stuck up there, but ball searches would\nspin the wheel to free them. The Time Machine is fed from the popper,\nand balls are returned to the left flipper.\n\n Bowl-A-Rama  Three stand-ups behind five flimsy little bowing pins.\nThree lights are in the playfield that represent a strike (center\ntarget) or a spare (a side target). This is in the same position as\nthe Neutral Zone in STTNG. It is lit after 'Go Bowling' (one of the\nramps) is hit. Completing the back during normal play (not after a\ngo bowling shot) adds to YABBA-DABBA-DO. Completing Y-D-D gives you\nthe bowling power-up as well (see Bronto Crane). There may be other\nawards for subsequent completions. See the section Bowling, in Rules,\nfor more info regarding the Bowling Power-Up. [Note that this has to\nbe hit really hard when the machine is new, as Williams stand-up\ntargets need to be 'broken in'!]\n\n Popper  Behind the Bowl-A-Rama is a popper that feeds balls to either\nthe Time Machine, or Bronto.\n\n Bronto  A tacky green dinosaur that the ball travels in. Basically it's\na wireform ramp covers in a green skin. I found that the ball would\noften get stuck inside there, hopefully this will be fixed. Balls are\nfed to Bronto from the popper, and end up in the bumpers.\n\n Center Lane  A small lane to the right of Bowl-A-Rama. It feeds the DIG\nroll-over lanes (but the ball can continue to the upper flipper if\nthe circumstances are right, and the shot is powerful enough). This\nis the Jackpot and standard counter shot. The first award is Extra\nBall at 7. The second is DIG Millions, which is Super Pops. [Note:\nThis lane is narrow. A fast ball hit here would often rattle around\nand dribble down the centre. Also a slow ball that dribbles out can\nhit the switch twice, the machine will credit this as two hits.]\n\n ROCK targets  Four drop targets that lie to the right of the centre\nlane, just below the bumpers. When complete they add letters to\nCONCRETE.\n\n DIG Roll-overs  Three roll-overs above the bumpers. When completed they\nincrease the bonus multipliers to a max of 10x. The ball is launched\nhere from the plunger. [Note that the lights can be rotated left and\nright by the respective flipper button.] After the bonus x is maxed,\ncompleting DIG awards 10 million.\n\n Bumpers  The usual triangle of bumpers in the top left corner of the\ngame (exactly like STTNG). They can feed to the orbit, or out the\nside to the playfield (exactly like STTNG).\n\n Right Ramp  (Also the 'Rescue' ramp). Used to award 1-2-3 or go bowling.\nThis ramp also feeds the bottom loop.\n\n Dino/Frenzy target  Can be lit for 'Dino' and/or 'Frenzy' and is used\nfor the Dino Frenzy mode. This target is situated to the right of the\nright ramp. There are 3 targets in total. One of these targets is\nalways lit to increase the value of Dino Frenzy.\n\n Right Orbit  Situated to the right of the right ramp, and feeds the\nroll-overs or Time Machine (when lit). This is also another Start\nMultiball shot.\n\n Upper Flipper  Sits at the entrance to the right orbit (like STTNG and\nTAF). Use it for shooting the BED targets, Bronto Crane and the\nU-Turn lane.\n\n Right Shell Targets  Directly opposite the Left targets, when complete\nthey light Drain Shield on the outlanes.\n\n Right Outlane  Has a 'Drain Shield' light that is lit with the Shell\ntargets. There is no kickback though, the ball is auto-plunged.\n\n Right Inlane  Nothing new here either. It doesn't seem to light\nanything.\n\n Right Sling Shot  A normal sling shot, but tiny.\n\n Right Flipper  The usual 'long' type.\n\n Bottom Loop  The two ramps are connected to this loop which runs above\nthe centre drain, very much like Hurricane. It gives the game a nice\nfeature in that a ramp can feed either flipper. When a ramp is lit to\nGo Bowling, the ball is always fed to the right flipper. When a ramp\nis lit for a 1-2-3 shot, the ball is fed to the appropriate flipper\nto make the next shot. The first time the balls travels along the\nloop can be a little unnerving, but you'll soon get used to it. The\nmachine doesn't directly tell you when it will happen, which I\nbelieve is good. If the ball falls off the loop, it will be\nre-launched.\n\n\nRules\n\nSkill Shot\n\nThe plunged ball will end up at the DIG roll-overs. One will be\nflashing and is movable with the flippers. Light the lane the ball will\ngo through. Skill shot awards start at 5 million, and increase by 2\nmillion.\n\nModes\n\nThere are 4 modes in this game, with a Mystery Mode for completing\nthem. Start a mode my completing 1-2-3 on the ramps. All three shots may\nnot be on the same ramp so look for the lights, and watch to see which\nflipper the ball goes to. This could be a problem if there are burnt out\nglobes. The modes are displayed in a line on the playfield. Lit ones have\nbeen played, the flashing one will be started next, and off ones are yet\nto be played. Modes can run concurrently, and during multiball. The\nbumpers change the currently flashing mode.\n\nShooting 1-2-3 awards 2 million, 4 million and 6 million.\n\nModes continue during multiball, but you cannot start new ones.\n\nScores for completed modes are added when the mode ends.\n\nThe modes are:\n\n\n Fred's Choice  Timer starts at 20 seconds. The orbits and centre lane\nare lit. The left orbit is Shot A (20 Million), the centre lane is\nShot B (10 Million), and the right orbit is Shot C (15 Million).\nWhen a shot is hit, it's value goes up by 3 Million. The display is\nvery nice during this round, and the sound is cool too. Three\ndifferent voices try and convince you which shot to hit: \"A!\", \"No\nC!\", \"Shoot it up the centre!\", \"All of the above?!\". The quotes\nare continuous, and are played at random, (i.e. not in the above\norder.)\n\n Joe's Diner  This is a Move Your Car mode, and it by far the coolest\none Dr. Flash has come up with! 15 Million counts down, and once the\nfirst shot is hit, you have 20 seconds to make 2 more for the same value.\nShoot the centre lane to collect it all.\n\nAt the start of the mode: \"Gimmie a burger, cola and fries.\"\n\nAt the first shot: \"That will be $47 sir.\"\n\"That's a rip off!\"\nThe guy in the car smashes the drive-through guy in the face.\n\nAt the second shot: \"Are you happy now sir?\"\n\"Do I look happy?\"\nThe guy in the car throws a grenade through the drive through window.\n\nAt the third (and final) shot: \"Where's my fries?!\"\nA large bird flies overhead and drops a large load on the diner.\nThis is followed by the guy in the car shouting \"Yea!\".\n\nAfter the third shot, the mode ends.\n\nThere are many in-the-back-ground quotes too, like \"I don't believe\nthis place!\".\n\n\n Bedrock Water Buffalo's  A 25 second mode that is the same as Bad\nImpersonator in Judge Dredd. The display shows a band playing on\nstage. Shoot the BED drop targets to throw something at them. After a\nwhile, the ROCK drop targets are lit instead of BED. I have no idea\nhow scoring works during this mode, as no information was displayed!\n\n Dino Frenzy  Two ball multiball. The 'Frenzy' light at all the Dino/\nFrenzy targets will be lit. Hitting any of the three targets will\naward the current value, and a cute animation. One of the targets\nwill have the 'Dino' light on too, hitting this target will increase\nthe value by 1 million (this is true during the whole game). The\nvalue starts at 10 million.\n\n  Mystery Mode   This can only be started after the other four. You have\n20 seconds to knock down the BED and ROCK drop targets for 100\nmillion. Each targets down scores 5 million. The mode ends after 20\nseconds, or when the big points are awarded, and Fred's Choice will\nbecome the currently flashing mode.\n\n\nMultiball\n\nInvent concrete to start multiball. There are three (well, four) ways to\nspot letters in CONCRETE; completing BED, completing ROCK, (for the first\nmultiball only) completing DIG, and getting the 'Spell CONCRETE' award\nfrom the Bronto Crane. I found that 2 letters would often be spotted\ntogether, but I couldn't figure out what made the difference.\n\nOnce CONCRETE is complete (there are lights in the center of the\nplayfield), 'Start Multiball' will be lit on the orbits. Shoot this and\nand ball will be fed to the popper. [Note, often when the ball was shot\nup the right orbit, the gate near the DIG lanes didn't open in time. This\nresulted in the ball going to the bumpers, but multiball started anyway.]\nMultiball would also start if you complete DIG while multiball is lit. That\nis, if you shoot the center lane and complete DIG, it'll start multiball. This\ncould be a bug.\n\nThe opening animation is great. I have no idea what it is, but assume\nit has something to do with the movie.\n\nThe ball will be popped into the time machine, and two other balls will\nbe launched into there. The jackpot starts at 40 Million and increases as\nlong as there is at least one ball in the time machine, [note that the\njackpot does not max at 255 million]. Collect the regular jackpot at the\ncentre lane, then the super jackpot at the U-Turn. Note that the ball\nthat scores the jackpot is fed to the upper flipper for a shot at the\nsuper (provided it as enough speed).\n\nThe Super Jackpot lights after the regular jackpot, and the regular\njackpot relights after the super. This continues until less than two\nballs remain in play. In my opinion this sucks. There should be some\nskill involved in relighting the regular jackpot (maybe completing 1-2-3\nor something.) Subsequent multiballs restart the jackpot at 40 million.\n\nIf multiball ends and no jackpots were scored, there is 20 seconds to\nrestart it.\n\nThe ball saver is on at the start of multiball, and relaunched balls go\ninto the time machine.\n\nModes continue during multiball, and you can even start the Time\nMachine Target modes.\n\nBronto Crane\n\nThe left orbit lights Bronto Crane, and another left orbit will cause\nthe ball to be diverted to the popper. [Note that the ball that lights\nBronto Crane will not be stopped at the DIG lanes, but will continue to\nthe upper flipper.]\n\nThe Bronto Crane is basically a random award. The ones I've seen so far\nare:\n\n\n  Bedrock Derby  Usually the first one to be awarded. The display shows\ntwo people racing on Dino's. Each bumper hit increases the speed of\none of them (the one you want to win). It is a 20 (?) second mode,\nand you get 30 million for winning. It is essentially a good idea,\nbut all you need are a couple of bumper hits and you've won. Both\nDino's go at the same speed, so once you're in front, you stay there.\nIt should be that the Dino that is behind gradually catches up - so\nthat you need to keep hitting the bumpers.\n\n  1, 2, 3 values doubled  The values for getting 1, 2 and 3 are doubled\nto 4 million, 8 million and 12 million.\n\n  Extra Ball  Awards and extra ball.\n\n  Spell CONCRETE  Spots concrete and lights multiball.\n\n  Bowling Power-Up  Displays a cool animation of Fred twirling a\nbowling ball on his finger. This guarantees a strike on the next\nGo Bowling shot.\n\n  Light 2x Playfield  Lights the 2x Playfield light at the U-Turn lane.\nWhen hit all playfield values are doubled for 20 seconds.\n\n  Multiplier Maxed  Maxes the Bonus Multiplier at 10x.\n\n  Big Points  Awarded 20 million.\n\n\nTime Machine Target\n\nThis target starts three modes.\n\n\n Time Machine  Starts the Time Machine for 20 seconds. Counter starts\nat 10 Million, and any ball put into the time machine (either orbits)\nwill start the value escalating until the ball comes out. After 20\nseconds, the value is awarded, and the time machine stops.\n\n  Job Change   Lights Change Job at the right orbit. Shooting the orbit\nawards 25 million. There must be something more to this.\n\n Help  Starts a search mode similar to Creature's multiball. Three shots\nare lit to search for the kids: Left orbit, Centre Lane, and Right\nOrbit. You have 20 seconds to find the kids by shooting Search. 5\nMillion is awarded per search, and 15 million for finding them. Shoot\nthe right ramp to rescue them.\n\n\nBowling\n\nOne of the two ramps is always lit to Go Bowling. Shoot the ramp (the\nball will be fed to the right flipper) and the bowl-a-Rama will be lit\nfor about 5 seconds. You'll hear the quote \"Go for the strike\". If you\nshoot a strike (centre target), you get 5 million. A spare (side target)\nis worth 3 million. A gutter ball (miss bowl-a-Rama altogether) is worth\nnothing. A total of each frame is kept. The strike is the best, as you\nhear everyone yelling \"Wooga Wooga Wooo...\". If you have received the\nBowling Power-Up (obtained from the Bronto Crane, or completing\nYabba-Dabba-Doo), Go Bowling will be a strike (so long as you hit the\nBowl-A-Rama). The quote will change to \"I can't miss with this one.\".\n\nThree strikes starts Bowl-A-Rama multiball (2 ball), where a Super\nStrike (center target) is worth 20 Million, and a Super Spare (side\ntarget) is worth 10 Million.\n\nBonus\n\nThe bonus multiplier starts at 1x and is increased by completing the\nDIG roll-overs. Each completion scores 5 million. The multiplier maxes at\n10x and subsequent completions result in 10 million.\nBonus count is made up of:\n\n 500k * Frames bowled\n 500k * Concrete letters\n Misc. which was always 1 Million.\n\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nA few occurrences of DOHO:\n\n On the slab where it spells out CONCRETE\n On the slab where it picks the match value\n On the side of the stage during the Water Buffalo mode.\n\n\nBugs\n\nFollowing is a list of software and hardware bugs found:\n\n The message Check Switch Upper Left EOS switch. There is no upper-left\nflipper!\n If a plunged ball doesn't make it into the roll-over lanes, the ball\nsaver doesn't come on.\n Sometimes the ball was popped into the time machine when it should\nhave gone into Bronto. This doesn't really effect game-play. Note\nthat the ball always went into the time machine when it was supposed\nto.\n\n\nAttract Mode Stuff\n\nIn attract mode, the Flintstone's theme is played, along with the\nwords 'bouncy ball' style on the display. The music continues while the\ndisplay shows the famous cat putting Fred out for the night scene. Very\ncool.\nBuy-In\n\nBuying an extra ball will start the currently flashing mode.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Flintstones", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/flintstones.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Flintstones", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

On with the rules...\nStarting the Game\n\n Choose Music(!)\nBefore each player's first ball, they are asked to choose what\nbackground music they want.  Left flipper chooses the film\nsoundtrack, while the right flipper chooses Edgar Winter's guitar-\nladen instrumental \"Frankenstein\".  The former is a dramatic\norchestral piece which fits the theme well.  The latter is true\nclassic rock 'n' roll which has nothing to do with the theme but\neverything to do with pinball.  Both arrangements squeeze all they\ncan from Sega's sound system (BSMT 2000), which pales in comparison\nto any Wms/Bally from TZ to the present.  If you are absolutely\nunable to decide, the game will pick Edgar Winter's for you after a\nlong delay.\n\nThe Switch\nLocated where you would expect to find the plunger.  It is a nice\nsolid lever which can be moved between an 'up' position and a 'down'\nposition, although all that matters is that you 'throw the switch' to\nthe other position to launch the ball.  Note that you can press both\nflippers simultaneously to launch the ball instead.  This is\nparticularly important if the switch on your machine is broken or\nflaky, which seems to be rather common.\n\nTournament mode:\nYou MUST use the switch; you can't use both flippers to launch the\nball.  Better hope that the switch works 100% of the time.\n\nSkill Shot\nThink back to any cheezy monster movie you have ever seen, and you\nshould remember a device consisting of two metal poles and a blue\nelectrical pulse connecting them, starting at the base and rising up\nto the top.  The display shows a similar device with the values 5M,\n10M, 15M, and 20M between the poles, and an electrical arc shifting\namong them.  Throw the switch (or press both flippers) to receive the\nshown award and to launch the ball.  The arc always starts at 5M, and\nsteps to 10M, 15M, and 20M in order.  Then it hops about quickly on\nand/or between the values.  If you throw the switch while the arc is\nbetween values, you receive only 1M.\n\nIf you are ready at the start of your ball, you are guaranteed 20M.\nIf not, you will need to rely on fast reflexes and a little luck.\nOn a good note, this is the closest thing in the game to a video\nmode :)\n\nThe Playfield\n\nFlippers\nThree of 'em, all full size.  Two in the normal positions and one on\nthe upper right, about where Whirlwind's upper flipper is located.\n\nSlingshots\nStandard triangular.\n\nThe rest of the playfield clockwise from the left flipper:\n\nLeft Inlane\nLights the Ingolstadt spinner at the start of the right orbit.\n\nLeft Outlane\nAwards special when lit.  Leads to the Alive Kickback.\n\nAlive Kickback\nYour average kickback.  Relight by shooting the Ice Cave.\n\nBut wait: If the ball goes to a lit kickback while a ball saver is\nactive, the ball is kicked as usual BUT THE KICKBACK STAYS LIT!!\nThis finally rectifies a long-standing discrepancy in games with\nboth a ball saver and a kickback.\n\nThere is also a 'Super Kickback' random Ice Cave award, which\nkeeps the kickback lit permanently for the rest of the current ball.\n\nFRankenstein letters\n2 of 12 (!) standups you need to light to start a mode.  Don't worry,\nthere are ways of spotting letters.  Note that the 'F' is partially\nobscured from the right flipper by the left slingshot.\n\nGeneva (lower) scoop\nA generously sized scoop.  As there are no under-the-playfield\ntunnels in Frankenstein, any shot into the scoop pops out from it.\nGeneva kickouts are very easy to catch, and shooting Geneva is a\ngood way to pass the ball from the right flipper to the left one.\n\nHit the Geneva scoop when lit to spell 'GENEVA' to start Geneva\nmultiball.  Geneva multiball jackpot starts at 20M, and is increased\nby 1M by shooting the Geneva scoop when not lit, up to a maximum of\n50M.  Geneva is automatically lit at the start of each ball and\nimmediately after Geneva multiball.  To light it yourself, shoot the\nleft lane.  Before starting your second Geneva multiball, the right\ninlane will temporarily light Geneva.\n\nBumpers\nThis is an area of 4 pop bumpers, similar in location to the pops on\nJurassic Park.  Bumpers start at 250K/hit, and the last one hit will\nflash.  Hit the spinner (right orbit) from the left inlane to\nincrease the flashing bumper value by 50K/spin, up to a max of 1M.\nThere is also a random Ice Cave award which maximizes the flashing\nbumper to 1M.  All bumpers reset to 250K after each ball and there is\nno way to hold values.  Don't expect huge points here.\n\nLeft Lane\nMake the left lane by splitting the bumpers.  A strong enough shot\nwill make it all the way around to the spinner at the right orbit\nentrance, and feeds the upper flipper.  It also lights both the\nGeneva and Sarcophagus scoops.  This is one of four jackpot shots.\n\nfrANKenstein letters\n3 more standups to the right of the left lane entrance, facing\nsideways to the right.  Complete with the other 9 to start a mode.\n\nChange Scene / Move Jackpot target\nA circular standup which faces up and to the right, so it cannot\nbe hit directly from a lower flipper.  If no modes are active in\nsingle ball play, this changes the lit scene.  During multiball this\ncan change the location of lit jackpots (!)\n\nSarcophagus (upper) scoop -- (no relation to Stargate's sarcophagus)\nNot directly shootable from the lower flippers, and kicks back to the\nupper flipper.  Shoot when lit to collect the Sarcophagus value,\nwhich starts each ball at 10M.  Shoot when unlit to raise value by\n5M.  If there is a limit on how high you can build the Sarcophagus\nvalue, it is at least 55M.\n\nLight Sarcophagus by shooting the left lane or right orbit.  If you\nmake the left lane to Sarcophagus combo (via the upper flipper), you\nare awarded twice the normal Sarcophagus value.  Sarcophagus spots\none FRANKENSTEIN letter.\n\nIce Cave\nA mostly hidden hole accessible from the upper flipper, or by an\nextremely fortuitous pop bumper bounce.  If the kickback is not\nlit, Ice Cave will light it for you (\"Alive!\").  If you are not\nin a mode or in multiball, a random award is given from this list:\n\n\n    5M points\n    10M points\n    20M points\n    Pop bumper maxed\n    Spinner at max\n    Geneva letter spotted\n    Double bonus lit (right outlane)\n    Spot three FRANKENSTEIN letters\n    Start Creation scene (mode)\n    Super kickback\n    Extra ball lit\n    Special lit (left outlane)\n\n\nIce Cave will also spot a FRANKENSTEIN letter and is a jackpot shot.\nThe ball is kicked into the bumper area when finished.\n\nNote: \"Spot three FRANKENSTEIN letters\" already counts the one that\nis always spotted.  So it really only spots two extra letters.\n\nTournament mode:\nThe Ice Cave awards are always given in the same order.  The\nfirst three are 5M, Spot 3 Letters, and Pop Bumper Maxed.\n\nSmall Lane\nA small lane connecting the very back of the playfield with the\nside of the Sarcophagus scoop.  Partial left lane/right orbit\nattempts will sometimes dribble down this lane, and may enter the\nSarcophagus.  I have yet to see it do anything special.\n\nObToy: Frankenstein's Monster\nA big plastic monster which towers over the back portions of the\nplayfield.  The head moves about quizzically from time to time, and\nboth arms are raised with spots for a ball in each hand.\n\nCreature 2-ball (more on this later) is the only time in the game\nthat the monster is used.  If Creature 2-ball is started from the\nNorth Pole VUK, the ball is popped to the left hand (left from the\nplayer's point of view, not the monster's).  Once a second ball is\nlaunched, the monster half-heartedly drops the first ball into the\nbumper area.  This is very unexciting, and as one r.g.p.'er\npolitically incorrectly noted, \"Frankenstein throws like a girl.\"\nBut after Creature 2-ball is completed (and a ball is popped to the\nright hand), the monster hurls the ball at the lower right flipper in\na much more impressive manner.  Not as impressively as the Raptor Pit\nin Jurassic Park, but this is probably a good thing.\n\nfrankENStein letters\nAnother bank of standups, facing the lower flippers.  Complete with\nthe other 9 to start a mode.\n\nNorth Pole\nLeads to a VUK which feeds the right inlane via a lengthy habitrail.\nThis shot is in the back center of the playfield and is roughly in\nthe same place as 'Start Mission' on STTNG.  Shoot when lit for extra\nball.  If no mode/multiball is running, it spots two FRANKENSTEIN\nletters.  The North Pole is also a good (but slow) way to get the\nball from the left to the right flipper.  This shot can be used to\nstart Creature 2-ball when lit, and serves as the lock during\nCreature 2-ball.  This is also a jackpot shot.\n\nThe first time you shoot North Pole in a game to spot FRANKENSTEIN\nletters, you will see a book entitled 'Journal of XXX' where XXX is\nsomeone's initials.  See the Spoilers on how to get YOUR initials\nhere, if you must know.\n\nfrankensTein letter\nStandup between the North Pole and the ramp.  Complete with the other\n11 to start a mode.\n\nRamp\nThe only ramp in the game, and it takes a reasonably solid shot from\nthe left flipper to make it all the way up.  Feeds the left inlane,\nso it is loopable.  The ramp is a jackpot shot.  Making ramp shots is\nthe only way to light Creature 2-ball, the prelude to full-blown 3-\nto 6-ball multiball.  This is important.\n\nfrankenstEin letter\nStandup between the ramp and the right orbit.  Complete with the\nother 11 to start a mode.\n\nIngolstadt spinner (start of right orbit)\nNormally worth roughly 100K/spin.  When lit from the left inlane it\nis worth ~200K/spin and increases pop bumper values.  A random Ice\nCave award can maximize spinner value at ~300K/spin for the rest of\nthe current ball.\n\nTo answer the inevitable question, Ingolstadt is a medium-sized city\nin southwest Germany where Victor goes to study medicine.\n\nRight Orbit\nShoot to feed the pop bumpers and light Sarcophagus.  It's an\nalternate way of starting Creature 2-ball when lit.\n\nSecret Diverter\nSurprise!  There is a diverter somewhere behind the North Pole VUK\nwhich, when active, will block right orbit attempts and feed the ball\nto the upper flipper instead.  The diverter is active right after the\nkickback is used to feed the upper flipper, and also when:\n\n\n  The kickback is not lit\n  The spinner is not lit by the left inlane\n  Creature 2-ball is not lit\n\n\nThis right orbit, under these conditions, is the preferred way of\nfeeding the upper flipper for the Ice Cave to relight the kickback.\nIt is really a shame that this diverter is not active more often,\nand that the player has no hints of when it is active, or even that\nit exists.  In general the game does a rather good job of pointing\nout what shots the player should go for, and this is the sole (but\nglaring) exception.\n\nfrankensteIN letters\nTwo standups immediately below the automatic plunger lane exit.\nComplete with the other 10 to start a mode.\n\nRight Outlane\nAwards double bonus when lit.  As the name suggests, this doubles\nyour end-of-ball bonus.  Double bonus can be lit by a random Ice Cave\naward.\n\nRight Inlane\nLights Geneva temporarily until your second Geneva multiball.  Then\nit doesn't seem to do much at all.\n\nCreation Scenes\nThese modes are started by completing all 12 FRANKENSTEIN standups or\nvia a random Ice Cave award.  Remember that letters can be spotted by\nshooting the North Pole, Sarcophagus, or Ice Cave.  Letters are spotted\nstarting with 'T' and moving right, wrapping around the word if\nnecessary to find an unlit letter to spot.  Note that the FRANKENSTEIN\nletters in the bottom center of the display indicate which letters are\nlit and unlit.  This is amazingly handy, as you would otherwise have to\nscan the playfield for 12 individual lamps.\n\nYou are awarded 20M points for starting a scene.  All points collected\nin the scene are awarded immediately.  With the exception of \"Light\nExtra Ball\", your scene total is displayed once the scene is over.\nNote that this total includes 10M of the 20M you are awarded when you\nstart the scene.\n\nDepending on how far you get in a given scene, you can be awarded a\nCREATION letter.  This is very desirable, and is the ultimate goal of\neach scene.  Your question now, of course, is \"what happens when you\nfinish spelling CREATION?\"  Check the spoilers if you really must know\nwhat the CREATION letters are good for.  But I recommend figuring it\nout for yourself.\n\nThere are eight scenes indicated in a circular pattern on the playfield.\n\"Frankenstein Millions\" is always the first lit.  You advance clockwise\none spot by ending a mode or by hitting the \"Move Scene\" target.\n\nStarting at the 6 o'clock position and moving clockwise:\n\n\nFrankenstein Millions\nShoot all 12 FRANKENSTEIN letters within 30 seconds.  You can spot a\nsingle letter by shooting the North Pole, Sarcophagus, or Ice Cave.\nYou are awarded 6M each for your first six letters, 8M each for the\nnext three, and 10M each thereafter.  Once you have finished spelling\nFRANKENSTEIN, the letters reset and you can spell it again, with 10M\nper letter.  Note that letters collected in this mode (or any mode)\ndo not help towards starting the next one.\n\nShoot all 12 letters within 30 seconds to collect a CREATION letter.\nThis is worth 100M + 10M * any extra letters you hit.\n\nStoning\nA frenzy for 30 seconds with all targets worth 500K each.  After\nmaking a certain number of targets [30?], values increase to 750K,\nand after some more they increase to 1M each.  The right orbit has a\nspinner and leads to the pop bumpers, so many switches can be\ntriggered with this shot.  Scoring in this mode tends to be lower on\naverage than most of the others.\n\nShoot a total of around 50-60 switches to collect a CREATION letter.\nThis is worth about 51M + 1M * any extra switches you hit.\n\nCreature Feature\nYou have 30 seconds to spell CREATURE by shooting the ramp eight(!)\ntimes.  The ramp awards 20M, 30M, 40M, 50M, 50M, 50M, [?], and [?]\nrespectively.  Ramps shots in this mode do not count towards lighting\nCreature 2-ball.\n\nI imagine that a CREATION letter would be collected by spelling\nCREATURE with 8 ramp shots, but I don't know of anyone who has\nactually done it.\n\nLynch Justine\nShoot the Left Lane for 3 consecutive hurry-ups.  The first starts at\n60M and counts down 1M/second until collected.  After shooting it,\nthe second starts at 60M, and once that is collected, the third\nstarts at 80M.  The mode ends once all 3 have been collected or\n20 seconds have elapsed.\n\nCollect all three hurry-ups for a CREATION letter.\nThis is worth 210M - 1M/seconds elapsed.\n\nNorth Pole\nShoot the North Pole VUK for a hurry-up starting at 90M, counting\ndown 5M/second down to 20M before expiring.  One shot ends the mode\nand awards a CREATION letter.\n\nLight Extra Ball\nExtra ball is lit at the North Pole.  The 'mode' ends immediately.\nA CREATION letter is automatically awarded!\n\nVoltage Mode\nShoot the ramp for 20M, then the North Pole for 30M, then the Ice\nCave for 40M, then the Left Lane for 50M.  Note that a voltmeter\ncounts down your time left before an overload.\n\nMake all four shots in time for a CREATION letter.\nThis is worth 150M.\n\nGraveyard\nThis mode is (IMHO) the most fun one other than Light Extra Ball ;)\nMake a monster by collecting two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head\nfrom the various holes.  Get arms from Geneva, legs from the North\nPole, the torso from the Sarcophagus, and the head from the Ice Cave.\nYou get 30M per body part, plus a 30M completion bonus for finishing\nyour dastardly work.\n\nComplete the monster (6 shots) for a CREATION letter.\nThis is worth 220M.\n\n\nSee Spoilers if you really must know what happens when you finish all\nthe modes.  But it's cooler if you do it yourself first.\nMultiball\nMultiball in Frankenstein is as complicated as multiball gets.  Don't\nworry if you have to reread this several times to get the hang of it.\n\nShoot the ramp to advance towards Creature 2-ball.  On most machines you\nneed 4 ramps to light it for the first time, but this is operator\ntweakable.  If you successfully complete Creature 2-ball, you will need\nan additional 2 ramps to light it again.\n\nIf you haven't completed Creature 2-ball yet, a ramp shot is spotted for\nyou when starting Ball 2 and when starting Ball 3.  It is not spotted\nwhen starting extra balls, earned or bought.  If you only needed one\nramp, Creature 2-ball will be lit for you.\n\nThere are two lamps at the ramp entrance, marked \"Lock 1\" and \"Lock 2\".\nDisregard the traditional meanings of Lock 1 and Lock 2.  This is what\nthese lamps are telling you:\n\n\n Ramps needed to lightCreature 2-ball  Lock 1 lamp  Lock 2 lamp \n 6 or more   Off    Off  \n 5           On     Off  \n 4           On     On   \n 3          Flash   On   \n 2           On    Flash \n 1          Flash  Flash \n\n\nConfused yet?  Just wait...\n\nOnce lit, shoot either the North Pole or the right orbit to start\nCreature 2-ball.  A ball saver is active for a few seconds at the start\nof this and all other multiballs.  If you start it with the North Pole,\nthe ball is popped to one of the monster's hands, which \"throws\" it\nwhile another ball is autolaunched.  If you use the right orbit, another\nball is simply launched.\n\nShoot the North Pole to lock a ball (the ball is popped to the monster).\nAfter a few seconds a big '6' appears on the display and numbers start\nto count down.  The jackpot value starts at 69M and counts down to 30M.\nQuickly shoot the North Pole, Geneva, the ramp, or the Sarcophagus to\nstop the countdown and start multiball.  The first number in the\nresulting jackpot value indicates how many balls you will have during\nmultiball (3, 4, 5, or 6).  If you cannot lock the second ball before\nthe countdown expires, the locked ball will unlock.  You then have to\nrelock a ball at the North Pole and try again (the jackpot value will\nagain start at 69M).  During the countdown, the pop bumpers will\nincrease the jackpot value by 1M/pop, up to a maximum of 69M.  If you\ndrain either ball before starting 3-6 ball, Creature 2-ball is over.\n\nA good strategy here is to catch a ball on each flipper.  Shoot the\nNorth Pole from the left flipper.  WAIT A FEW SECONDS until the big\n'6' appears, and then shoot the Geneva scoop.  If you miss and are\nfeeling greedy/risky, you may opt to wait out the countdown before\ntrying again in order to go for more balls and a higher jackpot.\n\nConfused now?  It gets better...\n\nOnce 3-6 ball is started, the appropriate number of balls are launched\nand the monster releases any balls he is holding.  Two jackpots shots\nare lit, the ramp and the left lane.  The jackpot value of each starts\nat the countdown value from Creature 2-ball, and can be increased by the\nFRANKENSTEIN letters, 2M/letter.  To make life more fun, the location of\nthe jackpots is subject to change via the \"Move Jackpot\" target.  The\njackpot shots shift from the left lane -> Ice Cave -> North Pole -> the\nramp -> left lane.  Completing both jackpots adds a ball if fewer than\nsix are in play.  At the same time, complete all of the FRANKENSTEIN\nletters for 20M.  There is no way to spot letters; you have to hit each\nstandup.  Having 6 balls bouncing around makes this much easier.\n\nOn some machines (I'm guessing this is operator settable), if you fail\nto make either jackpot during 3-6 ball, the North Pole is lit for a\nsecond-chance multiball.  Shoot the North Pole quickly and multiball\nrestarts with the jackpots equal to the Creature 2-ball countdown value.\n\nNow once you've made both jackpots and spelled FRANKENSTEIN, the ramp\nis lit for a 100M Creature Jackpot.  This value can be increased by 1M\nper spin at the spinner.  After collecting the Creature Jackpot, hit the\nSarcophagus to light the Super Jackpot.  The Sarcophagus is also worth\nan alleged 50M, but this is not exactly advertised.\n\nOnce lit, the Super Jackpot cycles between the four possible jackpot\nshots.  I am told that after getting the Super Jackpot, you start all\nover again, except you have to hit all four jackpots and spell FRANKEN-\nSTEIN.  The insanity ends once you are down to less than two balls.\n\nRead it all again and it might be a little more clear.  Or not.\n\nFor those who can't take it, there is a simpler but much less lucrative\nGeneva multiball.\nGeneva Multiball\nSpell GENEVA at the Geneva scoop to start, as described in the \"Geneva\"\nsection of the Playfield description.\n\nA 3-ball multiball is started immediately, and all four jackpots are\nlit for the Geneva jackpot value.  There does not seem to be a way of\nincreasing this value during Geneva Multiball.  Once all four jackpots\nhave been collected, shoot the Geneva scoop to relight them, and repeat\nuntil less than two balls remain.  The \"Move Jackpot\" target has no\neffect in Geneva Multiball.\n\nAfter Geneva multiball is over, the jackpot value reverts back to 20M.\nStarting Multiball During Modes\nThis is complex and confusing enough to merit its own section.\n\nRamps made during modes count towards lighting Creature 2-ball, except\nduring \"CREATURE Feature\".  Once Creature 2-ball is lit, the North Pole\nand the right orbit will always start it.  The mode ends immediately,\nand as described below, sometimes a CREATION letter/extra points are\nawarded.\n\nShooting the Geneva scoop when lit during a mode will award a GENEVA\nletter, except during Graveyard before both arms have been collected.\nGeneva multiball will start once all letters have been awarded, and the\nmode ends immediately.  I'm not sure, but I think that multiball will\nstart even if Graveyard is running and less than two arms have been\ncollected.  This needs double-checking.\n\nOnce multiball starts, the mode ends and the scene total is displayed.\nUnder certain conditions, extra points are awarded as if you had\ncompleted additional goals within the mode, and sometimes a CREATION\nletter is also awarded.  Bear in mind that the scene total and CREATION\nletter animations are sometimes pre-empted.  Here is what I know so far:\n\n\nFrankenstein Millions\nNo extra points are awarded, but a CREATION letter is always given.\nYou should try to complete the mode normally if you are good at\nshooting standups, because letters are worth 10M each after spelling\nFRANKENSTEIN.\n\nStoning\nYou are awarded 51M and a CREATION letter if you have not already\ngotten them on your own.  Even if you are a pro at the spinner shot,\nand the spinner and pops tend to trigger very often, you won't be\nable to get very many extra points by doing the mode yourself.  This\nis a very good time to light and start Creature 2-ball.\n\nCreature Feature\nYou don't get anything other than what you've already done.\n\nLynch Justine\nThe currently lit hurry-up is collected at its current value.  If the\nthird hurry-up is lit, the CREATION letter is also awarded.\n\nNorth Pole\nYou get a CREATION letter and the hurry-up at its current value.\n\nVoltage\nYou are always awarded full credit for the mode (150M) and the\nletter, so there is no advantage whatsoever in doing it yourself.\nThis is another good time to start Creature 2-ball.\n\nGraveyard\nThis is weird.  For starting Creature 2-ball, you are given the\nhead, torso, arms, and one leg.  If you already had at least one leg,\nyou get the CREATION letter, otherwise you don't.  I'm not sure\nabout what happens if you start Geneva multiball, or if that makes\nany difference.  This needs more study.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere is a distinct lack of any kind a grace period anywhere, not with\nthe ball saver, the mode awards, or the multiball jackpots.  Multiball\nin particular ends the INSTANT that the second-to-last ball is detected\nin the trough, which is very frustrating if the last ball is a split\nsecond away from triggering a jackpot.  This is particularly frustrating\nin that the ramp switch is on the return part of the path, so it is very\npossible for a ball to be safely up the ramp but not count as a jackpot\nbecause another ball drained in that instant.  Ack.\n\nSometimes if you have a mid-to-low scoring Ball 1 and have not received\nan extra ball yet, the scene indicator moves to \"Light Extra Ball\".  If\nthis happens, the Ice Cave will always award Light Extra Ball if you\nshoot it before starting the Light Extra Ball mode.  This can be very\nhandy to know, as you could end up with two quick extra balls.  I am\nguessing that this is somehow connected with extra ball percentaging.\nI have seen this happen after Ball 1 with a score as high as 415M.\n\nAlso, I have seen Special lit at the start of ball 3 during an\nespecially low scoring game.  I am guessing that this is somehow\nconnected with replay/credit percentaging.  It is interesting to note\nthat whenever Special is lit, the kickback is also lit.  So when you get\na special, you always get the ball back too.  Weird.\n\nIn order to be asked if you want to buy in, you must press the Extra\nBall button hidden below the start button DURING THE GAME, before the\nfinal bonus count leads to the match sequence.  The machine I play is\nset to One buy-in, and buying in does not seem to disqualify you from\nmaking the high-score chart.  You may consider getting in the habit of\npressing the Start button and then the Extra Ball button every time you\nstart a game to avoid missing opportunities to buy in.\nFun With Bonus\nOnly shots made during the current ball count towards bonus.  There is\nno way to hold bonus.  Only actual standup hits count towards\nFRANKENSTEIN letters, spotted letters do not apply.\n\n\nA) Ramp Bonus\nMultiply ramp shots by 1M.\n\nB) Frankenstein Letters\nAward 1M for first 20 FRANKENSTEIN letters, and 500K for each\nadditional letter.\n\nC) Shot Bonus\nTake sum of shots to Geneva, left lane, Sarcophagus, Ice Cave,\nNorth Pole, and right orbit, and multiply by 1M.\n\n\nYour bonus is A + B + C + 1M, all multiplied by 2 if you get \"Double\nBonus\".  I don't think that you can double your bonus more than once.\nBugs\nAfter ending 3-6 ball multiball, sometimes the 'Shoot Sarcophagus to\nLight Super Jackpot' message stays on well after multiball is over.\nSame thing with 'Shoot Geneva to Relight Jackpots' in Geneva Multiball.\nIt fixes itself after you do something which uses the full display, like\nspelling GENEVA or spotting letters at the North Pole.\n\nAlso, I have witnessed a scenario in 6-ball where the ramp was the sole\njackpot left, and I hit the \"Move Jackpot\" target several times, but the\ndisplay continued to instruct me to shoot \"THE RAMP\".  The correct\njackpots flashed in turn after every hit and the ramp was no longer\nflashing, but the display was never updated.   I have since seen the\nsame behavior with \"NORTH POLE\" and \"LEFT LANE\".\nStrategy\nMultiball is the best source of quick points.  Modes take time to start\nand are not always lucrative or easy to complete.  However, successfully\ncompleting modes can be very rewarding in the long run, especially once\nyou finish all of them.\n\nOne relatively safe but very slow way of collecting FRANKENSTEIN letters\nis to make endless North Pole -> Geneva -> North Pole shots.  You may\nconsider using this strategy to complete the 'T' and 'E' ramp targets\nand the 'FR' and 'IN' fringe targets, as they can be hard (and maybe\ndangerous) to hit.  The 'ANK' and 'ENS' banks are easier and safer.\n\nThe Creature 2-ball -> 6-ball sequence is the fastest way to get big\npoints.  Looping the ramp shot is the key to lighting 2-ball, so get\ngood at this shot.  The ramp is rather steep (by necessity to get around\nthe monster assembly), so often the ease of ramp shots on a given\nmachine is a function of the left flipper strength.\n\nGeneva multiball is something of a throw-away since it is so hard to\nincrease the jackpot value to a useful figure.  You could try shooting\nthe unlit Geneva scoop, letting the kickout bounce over to the right\nflipper, and repeat.  This gets old very quickly, however, and does not\nrepresent a significant return on the investment of time and risk.\n\nIf you are playing for a tournament, you probably want to concentrate on\n6-ball.  Modes don't give huge points unless you get all of them, which\ntakes forever and is quite difficult.  If you want to own a high score\nchart, you will likely want to use a balanced attack of modes and\nmultiball, starting multiball during modes when appropriate.\nQuotes\nUnder construction\nCows\nNo cows.  But there are four hedgehogs; one on the display during\nattract mode, and three under the glass somewhere ;)\nCredits\nGame Credits:\n\nThey're listed during attract mode, and there's lots of 'em.\nI will have them available for the next version of this guide.\n\nGuide Credits:\n\nThe author (me):\n\n\n      Chris Hehman\n\n\nContributors (alphabetically):\n\n\n      Lea Ann Armentrout\n      Graham Bisset\n      Orin Day (thanks, Orin!)\n      Matt Hehman\n      Steve Lane\n      Doug Taylor\n\n\nSpecial thanks to everyone who posted to r.g.p. on the subject, and to\nKevin Martin for making those posts easily searchable.\nMore Work To Be Done\nIf you have any information not found in this guide in the following\nareas, please enlighten me.\n\n\n  Maximum Sarcophagus value\n  Miscellaneous scoring\n  Number of switches needed for scoring levels in Stoning scene\n  Finishing Creature Feature scene\n  Starting multiball during Graveyard scene\n  Super Jackpot scoring\n  Jackpot values after SJ\n  Ice Cave award order during Tournament mode\n  Operator settings (any info is better than what I have)\n\n\nPlease also mail if you find anything missing from the Guide, and\nespecially if you find something which isn't 100% correct.

Go away and start playing!\n\nFor those with absolutely no patience:\n\n\n Completing both jackpots and FRANKENSTEIN letters in 6-ball multiball\nmakes you 6-ball Victor!  Your initials will then be shown on the\nJournal cover in attract mode and upon the first North Pole shot\nthat doesn't do anything special.  Actually, I haven't been able to\nrule out that just the jackpots are enough... anyone know?\nYou don't seem to get 6-ball Victor if you also got a high score :(\n\n After finishing all eight modes, the scene indicators all flash.\nUpon starting the \"ninth\" mode, you are awarded 100M times the number\nof CREATION letters you have collected.  Extra ball and double bonus\nare lit.  Then a 6-ball multiball starts where all switches are worth\n1M points each, with the North Pole worth 10M and the ramp worth 20M.\nYou also get 100M each time you spell FRANKENSTEIN.  Any drained\nballs are relaunched, and Super Kickback is active.  After 60 seconds,\nall balls drain and your CREATION multiball total (I think this\nincludes the 100M times CREATION letters) is displayed.  Then a single\nball is plunged and you can start collecting modes all over again.\nSuper Kickback will remain active for the rest of your ball (yay!)\nObBrag: My best CREATION multiball total is 934M.\n\n In attract mode:   Become an Organ Donor 1-800-474-8667.\nI haven't tried it yet.\n\n There is a hedgehog on each flipper :)\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein", "manufacturer": "Sega Pinball Inc.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/frankenstein.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

(I didn't do the original transcription, but I did\nattempt to clean it up a little and correct typos.)\n\nThis is about 85% of what you need to know to play FREDDY; a lot of\nstuff has been left out (like, say, when you can and can't relight the\nkick save), but it's not a bad start.  I'm not really into writing\nrules sheets, so if anyone else would like to take things from here\nand expand it further, they're certainly welcome to do so.\n\nGame Mode\nThe player begins play in the \"awake\" state which is the normal\nplay mode.  When the player falls asleep, they enter a nightmare\nplay mode.  These nightmare play modes are described below.  The\nplayer may enter a nightmare play mode from the plunger skill\nshot, \"1... 2...\" (MYSTERY) feature from shooting the boiler\nroom, or from time.\nNightmares (General)\nDuring any nightmare, the player attempts to defeat Freddy\nKrueger by shooting any of the flashing \"FREDDY\" shots.  Each\nshot increments the Freddy Meter billboard.  Completing this\nmeter qualifies the boiler shot.  Making the qualified boiler\nshot defeats freddy, awards ten million points times nightmare\nnumber and returns the player to the \"awake\" state unless\nmultiball is still in play.  If multiball play is still active,\nthen the jackpot shots are qualified.\n\nWhile the player is awake, they can earn items which can help\nthem out during any nightmare.  These items are multiball, extra\npower, and set alarm.  If multiball is earned, then the\nnightmare begins with automatic multiball play.  If more power\nis earned, then during the next nightmare, each Freddy shot\nincrements the Freddy Meter three places instead of the usual\ntwo.  If set alarm is earned, then five seconds before the end\nof the nightmare, the boiler shot is qualified to grab Freddy.\nIf the player grabs Freddy, then the nightmare continues into\nthe awake state. During any nightmare with multiball, the lower\nleft target flashes to add an additional ball.\n\nNightmare #1:\n\n\n Begin with multiball\n Begin with one \"Save Soul\" target lit.\n\n\nThe following items are given to the player only the first time\nthrough this nightmare\n\n\n Begin with more power.\n Begin with alarm set.\n Begin with most of Freddy Meter completed.\n\n\nNightmare #2:\n\n\n Begin with one \"Save Soul\" target lit.\n\n\nThe following items are given to he player only the first time\nthrough this nightmare:\n\n\n Begin with alarm set.\n Begin with most of Freddy Meter completed.\n Hurry-up extra ball\n\n\nNightmare #3:\n\n\n Begin with multiball.\n Begin with all \"Save Soul\" targets lit.\n\n\nThe following items are given to the player only the first time\nthrough this nightmare:\n\n\n Begin with most of Freddy Meter  completed.\n\n\nNightmare #4:\n\n\n Begin with Freddy's Jackpot active.\n Begin with one \"Save Soul\" target lit\n\n\nThe following items are given to the player only the first time\nthrough this nightmare:\n\n\n Begin with more power.\n Begin with some of Freddy Meter completed.\n\n\nNightmare #5:\n\n\n Begin with multiball.\n Begin with one \"Save Soul\" target lit.\n\n\nThe following items are given to the player only the first time\nthrough this nightmare:\n\n\n Begin with some of Freddy Meter completed.\n\n\nNightmare #6:\n\n\n Begin with Freddy's Jackpot active.\n Begin with all \"Save Soul\" targets lit.\n\n\nThe following items are given to the player only the first time\nthrough this nightmare:\n\n\n Begin with some of Freddy Meter completed.\n\n\nFinal Nightmare:\n\nThis round always begins with four ball multiball.  If the\nplayer has not completed all of the shots when multiball ends,\nthen they are given a grace period to complete the shots.  The\nplayer must complete five strobing shots to qualify the boiler\nroom.  If the player successfully completes all five shots and\nthen completes the boiler shot, they defeat Freddy and receive\nthe following awards:\n\n\n Collect 1,000,000 points for each soul.\n Collect 1,000,000 points for each Kruegerand.\n Collect 10,000,000 points for each Freddy defeated up to this point.\n\n\nMultiball Jackpots:\n\nIf the player is in multiball when any Freddy is defeated, then\nthe five jackpot lamps flash.  Each shot awards the player the\njackpot value and turns off the corresponding lamp.  This\ncontinues until the player reaches the last shot which continues\nto remain active. The last shot switches to the captive ball.\n\nDream Warriors\n\nThis is a multiball mode where shooting the strobing shot awards\nsuper jackpot.  Completing a strobing shot changes the strobing\nshot to another location.  This continues until the shot is the\nupper left spot target which remains active. This feature lasts\nuntil the player leaves multiball.\n\nHidden Mode:\n\nThis is a multiball where each boiler shot awards 10,000,000\npoints.  This feature lasts until the player leaves multiball.\nOnly one hidden mode per player is allowed.\n\nKruegerand Multiball:\n\nThis is a multiball where each boiler door shot awards 5\nkruegerands.  This feature lasts until the player leaves\nmultiball.\n\nSouls Saved:\n\nVarious features award \"Souls\" to the player.  These Souls are a\nbonus which may be collected at a later time.  If the player\nexceeds high souls to date, they enter their initials.\n\nKruegerands:\n\nVarious features award \"Kruegerands\" to the player.  These\nKruegerands are a bonus which may be traded for items or\ncollected at a later time.\n\nClaw Save:\n\nCompleting C-L-A-W allows player to activate the claw save device\nbetween the flippers.  Once this device is activated, the letters in\nC-L-A-W are reset.\n\n\"Take That\" (Top L. Target)\n\nDuring the awake state, if the average game is less than three\nminutes, this target lights kick save. If the kick save is already\nlit, then claw save is lit.  If the claw save is already lit, then\nenable the hurry up extra ball. If the player has already won\ntwo hurry up extra balls, then score 20m instead. If the\naverage game time is greater than three minutes, then\nthe first award = 5M, second = 10M and the third = hurry up extra ball.\n\nGlove Flipper:\n\nThis device is positioned near the lower left up kicker.  If the\nplayer has this device qualified when the ball enters this\nup kicker, then the player is allowed to flip the ball off of the\nramp using this device.  If the player flips the ball into the\ncaptive ball, they receive an award.\n\nLow Game Special:\n\nIf the payer begins the last ball with less than 20,000,000\nthen the right outlane special will be lit for a timed period.\n(see game adjustments)\n\n1... 2... (MYSTERY):\n\nGive player a random award.\n\nSleep/Awake Meter:\n\nThis a vertical billboard positioned in the upper center of\nplayfield.  This meter is active while the player is \"Awake\".\nTime increments this meter toward \"Asleep\".  If the player\ncompletes a \"Coffee\" shot, this meter is incremented toward the\ntop.  If this meter reaches the bottom, the player enters the\nnext nightmare.  If this meter reaches the top, then the player\nis \"Fully Awake\" and the captive ball is strobed and Hidden Mode\nis qualified. If the player shoots the center left spot target\nwhile fully awake, then they are awarded the Hidden Mode.  If\nthe player hits the captive ball spot target while fully awake,\nthen they are awarded \"Freddy's Bones\" feature.\n\nFreddy Bones:\n\nAward player all three \"next nightmare\" features. If player has\nalready earned all three \"next nightmare\" features then award\ntwenty kruegerands.\n\nT. V. Set:\n\nAward 10,000,000 times hit in succession number when\nflashing-out.  Begin flashing-out when lit.  Collect bonus when\nflashing during a nightmare.\n\nBonus:\n\nPop bumper hits add 300,000  to this end of ball bonus.  If\nbumpers are flashing, pop bumper hits add 1,000,000 to  this\nbonus.\n\nThree Jackpots:\n\nCompleting any multiball jackpot turns on its corresponding\nlamp. Completing any Freddy jackpot turns on its corresponding\nlamp. Completing any combo jackpot turns on its corresponding\nlamp.  Completing all three lamps qualifies the lower left\nup kicker for \"dream warriors\".\n\nCombo Feature:\n\nThe left return lane rollover qualifies the captive ball for the\ncombo feature.  Hitting the captive ball spot target when lit\nopens the top left gate and flashes the center jackpot shot for\na short timed period.  Completing this jackpot shot awards the\ncombo jackpot.\n\nToggle Function:\n\nVarious features (see adjustments) can be percentaged by\nactivating and deactivating them. The toggle can turn some off\nand turn others on.\n\nFreddy's Shop: (Trade Kruegerands)\n\nA ball going through the right return lane when lit\nflashes Freddy' head for one shot (shoot through the pop\nbumpers). Making this shot allows the player to purchase\nan item using kruegerands. The item offered depends on\nthe amount of kruegerands that the player presently\nhas: (any unused kruegerands are collected as an\nend of game bonus)\n\n\n 10 Thru 19 Kruegerands  10 Souls\n 20 Thru 29 Kruegerands  Kruegerand Multiball\n 30 Thru 39 Kruegerands  Hurry-up Extra Ball\n 40 Thru 49 Kruegerands  Extra Ball\n 50 ,70, 90 (Adjustable) Dream Warriors\n\n\nPlayfield Features:\n\nOuthole:\n\n\n Collect end of ball bonus(es).\n\n\nLeft outlane rollover:\n\n\n Score 3,000.\n Activate kick save when lit.\n\n\nRight outlane rollover:\n\n\n Score 3,000.\n Award special when flashing.\n\n\nLeft return lane rollover:\n\n\n Score 30,000.\n Qualify captive ball for combo feature when lit.\n\n\nRight return lane rollover:\n\n\n Score 30,000.\n Activate trade kruegerand feature when lit.\n\n\nKicking rubbers:\n\n\n Score 30.\n Perform toggle function.\n\n\n end rules \n\nSteve Baumgarten, PANIX, New York, NY\n\"New York... when civilization falls apart,\nremember, we were way ahead of you.\"\n- David Letterman\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Freddy: A Nightmare on Elm Street", "possible_shots": "FREDDY shots, boiler shot, lower left target, Save Soul target, Freddy's Jackpot, captive ball, strobing shot, upper left spot target, boiler door shot, C-L-A-W, Top L.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Funhouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Funhouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunhouse\nMark Phaedrus\nDate: 16 Apr 1991\n\n\nI made enough misteaks the first time around that I've prepared one\nrevision of the original FunHouse Rules posting.  This will be the last\nrevision, unless Williams decides to put out a new ROM revision or something.\n\nA clarification of purpose: this posting is not intended to tell you\nevery single rule about the game.  Score values of targets aren't covered\nunless they're fairly big-ticket items (50K or more).  In addition, it is not\ndesigned to tell you everything there is to discover about FunHouse, that would\ntake a lot of the Fun out of it.  There are quite a few subtle features in\nthere waiting to be discovered, and I'm not going to do all your work for you\n(even if I'd discovered them all myself, which I haven't).  In particular,\nI've removed my earlier mention of the Sausage Bonus, since the information I\ngave earlier was partially wrong and you'll figure it out well enough when the\ntime comes anyway.\n\nMy thanks to Williams for producing a fantastic game and providing me\nwith the manual.  I hope I'm not giving away any company jewels; if I am, I'm\nsure they'll be sending someone around for me shortly. :)\n\nMy further thanks to the very nice gentleman at Williams (who shall\nremain nameless and addressless; he has enough work to do answering *my*\nemail, thank you very much), who offered some corrections to the prior\nposting, among other things.  Where this posting is wrong, it is now\nDEFINITIVELY wrong.\n\nIf you're not interested in FunHouse rules, skip this message now and\nrun get your head examined.\n\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\nTake control of the FunHouse and put Rudy to sleep by advancing the clock\nto midnight.  Once Rudy is asleep, shoot the ball into his mouth to start\nMulti-ball and a chance at tens of millions of points.\n\nSTARTING THE GAME\nOne to four players can play; the Start button will light when there are\ncredits in the machine that haven't been played yet.  Don't leave half-credits\nin the machine when you start a game; they will disappear at the end of the\nfirst ball.  New players can enter the game by inserting coins and pressing\nStart until the end of the first ball; after that, pressing Start aborts the\ncurrent game for all players and begins a new one.\n\nPLUNGER SKILL SHOT\nShoot the ball from the plunger so it stops in the loop at the top of the\nmachine and rolls back into \"Rudy's Hideout\" (a kicker just behind Rudy's\nhead).  250K the first time during a game, then 500K, then 750K, then 1M every\ntime after that.\n\n\"YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK!\"\nA ball that goes straight from plunger to drain without touching a scoring\ntarget is not counter against you.  FunHouse is a bit more liberal than other\nmachines in this regard; for instance, it often returns very weak plunger shots\nthat go down the jet bumper lane and into the right outlane, even though they\ntouch two scoring targets.\n\nTHE CLOCK\nThe clock starts at 8:00.  (If it does not, your machine is not on\nstandard settings; see DIFFICULTY OPTIONS.)  It holds its value from ball to\nball, resetting to 5:00 after the MIdnight Multi-ball sequence completes.\nShots that advance the clock are: starting a ball (30 minutes); Hidden Hallway\n(10 minutes); Wind Tunnel (15 minutes); center ramp (15 minutes, then 20, then\n25, then 30); jet bumpers (0 minutes when off, 5 when lit, 10 when flashing);\nblue S-T-E-P targets (5 minutes); Superdog targets (5 minutes); manhole below\njet bumpers (30 minutes); Trapdoor (10 minutes); Trapdoor loop (10 minutes).\n\nThe lane that runs between the jet bumpers and the right in/outlanes will\nlight an unlit jet bumper, or flash a lit one.\n\nThe clock will not advance past 11:25 during Quick Multiball or during\nFrenzy.\n\nWhen the clock reaches 11:30, the Hidden Hallway lock flashes.  The only\nway to advance the clock further is to lock a ball there; this moves the clock\nto 11:45 and serves another ball.  Locking another ball advances the clock to\nMidnight, sends Rudy to sleep and opens his mouth to start Midnight Multiball.\n\nAdvancing the clock to 11:30 for a second time during a game lights the\nSpecial lights on the outlanes.  The lights toggle between on and off each\ntime the ball strikes a slingshot, and the special must be collected before\nthe end of the ball or it is lost.\n\nRUDY\nHitting Rudy's jaw from the side flipper adds to your end-of-ball bonus\n(this bonus is 50000*the number of Rudy hits; you start the game with 1 hit,\nand hits carry over from ball to ball), and relights the Mirror award light.\n\nRudy talks frequently, commenting on the game action.  Shooting the ball\ninto his open mouth during this time is a Rudy Gulp, worth 250K.\n\nWhen the Million light is lit (lit by the Mystery Mirror or Quick\nMultiball), hitting Rudy's jaw or mouth scores 1M.\n\nWhen the clock is at midnight and Rudy's mouth falls open, locking a ball\nin Rudy's open mouth scores 1M (2M if Million was lit by the Mystery Mirror as\nwell), and starts Midnight Multiball.\n\nTRAPDOOR LOOP/TRAPDOOR\nAt the start of the game, shooting the ball around the Trapdoor loop\nopens the Trapdoor for about 8 seconds; hitting the open Trapdoor scores 500K.\nOnce the 500K is collected, two consecutive Trapdoor loops are needed to open\nthe Trapdoor, which is then worth 750K; once that is collected, three\nconsecutive loops open the Trapdoor for 1M.\n\nThe Trapdoor can also start Frenzy (see FRENZY), and it awards Million+\nduring Midnight Multiball.\n\nThe Trapdoor is disabled during Quick Multiball.\n\nWhenever the Trapdoor is open, its bonus will also be collected if a ball\nrolls over the Trapdoor loop sensor behind the Trapdoor.  This usually happens\nif a ball just clears the sensor and then rolls back over it on the way down.\n\nHitting the Trapdoor when it's not supposed to be open (for instance,\nwhen the game opens/shuts everything when it can't find a ball) awards 100K.\n\nCENTER RAMP\nHitting the ramp awards 75K and 15 minutes, then 100K/20 minutes, then\n125K/25 minutes, and 150K/30 minutes from then on.  This resets at the start\nof every ball and after Midnight Multiball.\n\nWhen the blue \"STEPS\" light is lit at the entrance to the ramp, the\ncenter ramp leads to the Steps plunger instead of the left inlane.\n\nRUDY'S HIDEOUT\nShooting the ball into this kicker behind Rudy's head scores 75K during\nnormal play.  (See PLUNGER SKILL SHOT.)\n\nGANGWAY\nThe inside right inlane starts the left Gangway flashing; the Trapdoor\nloop and the left inlane start the right Gangway flashing.  Hitting an unlit\nGangway starts it flashing as well.  Hitting a flashing Gangway awards 150K,\nthen 200K, then 250K, then 250K and lights the Extra Ball light on the Hidden\nHallway.  Gangway lights turn off after a few seconds.  The Gangway value\ncarries over from ball to ball, until the Extra Ball is lit; after that, the\nGangway resets to 75K at the start of every ball.\n\nWIND TUNNEL/MYSTERY MIRROR\nOrdinarily, the Wind Tunnel hole just awards 15 minutes and 10000 points;\nhowever, when the white \"MIRROR\" light is lit, hitting the Wind Tunnel awards\nthe flashing Mirror award.\n\nThe \"MIRROR\" light is on at the start of each ball; it is turned off\nwhenever a Mirror award is collected, relit when Rudy's jaw is hit, and relit\nfor about 4 seconds when the ball goes down the right center lane.\n\nThe six awards are:\n\n\"Extra Ball Is Lit\"--Hidden Hallway extra-ball light comes on, and stays\non until collected.\n\n\"Million Is Lit\"--the next hit on Rudy's jaw during this ball is worth\n1M.\n\n\"Jet Bumpers At Maximum\"--all three bumpers flash for the rest of the\nball (10 clock minutes for each bumper hit).\n\n\"Superdog\"--20 seconds of Superdog bonus time.\n\n\"Steps Gate Open\"--hitting the center ramp OR a drain down the left\noutlane will now lead to the Steps plunger.\n\n\"Quick Multiball\"--see QUICK MULTIBALL\n\nThe Mirror is disabled during Quick Multiball and Midnight Multiball.\n\nOnce all six awards are collected, the Mirror light relights and all six\naward lights flash; hitting the Mirror at this point starts Super Frenzy (see\nFRENZY).  (Note to Whirlwind players: this does NOT award all six bonuses\nagain, unlike Whirlwind's Mega Door Score.)  Once Super Frenzy is started, the\nMirror is disabled for the rest of the ball, after which it resets.\n\nSTEPS\nThe Steps plunger can be reached by the center ramp (after hitting the\nMirror \"Steps Open\" or the manhole) or a left outlane drain (after hitting the\nMirror \"Steps Open\").\n\nThere are three steps on the ramp, each with a flashing light.  At the\nstart of the game, only the \"Light Frenzy\" light is lit; hitting all four\n\"S-T-E-P\" targets lights one unlit step (first Light Frenzy, then 500K, then\nLight Extra Ball).  Hitting a step with a flashing light by it collects that\nstep's award and unlights that step.  Hitting an unlit step awards 100K.\nShooting the ball all the way to the top of the ramp awards 20 seconds of\nSuperdog time.\n\n\"Light Frenzy\" opens the Trapdoor and lights its \"Frenzy\" light (which\nstays on until collected); \"Light Extra Ball\" lights the Hidden Hallway\nextra-ball light (for the rest of the ball only).\n\nWhen \"Light Extra Ball\" is collected, the \"500K\" light goes off as well.\n\n\"Light Extra Ball\" can only be collected once per game.\n\nSUPERDOG\nSuperdog is started by the Steps ramp or the Mirror.  For 20 seconds,\nhitting any of the three Superdog targets is worth 200K, then 225K, then 250K,\nand so on.  Collecting Superdog from the Steps or Mirror while Superdog is\nalready in progress adds 20 seconds to the existing Superdog timer.\n\nThe Superdog timer stops while the ball is in the Wind Tunnel or the\nSteps ramp; the Hidden Hallway lock stops the timer as well, but 3 seconds may\ntick off before the timer finally stops.\n\nFRENZY/SUPER FRENZY\nFrenzy is started by hitting the Trapdoor when the Frenzy light is lit;\nSuper Frenzy is started by hitting the Wind Tunnel after all six awards have\nalready been collected.  The Frenzy Bonus starts at 120K for normal Frenzy,\n1.5M for Super Frenzy; during the Frenzy period, all playfield targets add 50K\n(or 100K for Super Frenzy) to the Frenzy Bonus.  The Frenzy Timer starts at 20\nseconds, and stops whenever the Superdog timer would stop.  The Frenzy Bonus\nis added to your score at the end of the ball.  (Don't tilt.)\n\nThe clock will not move past 11:25 during Frenzy.\n\nCollecting a Frenzy while one is already in progress adds 20 seconds to\nthe existing Frenzy timer.  Collecting Super Frenzy while a Frenzy is running\nadds 20 seconds to the Frenzy timer and converts it to a Super Frenzy.\nCollecting Frenzy while Super Frenzy is running adds 20 seconds to the Frenzy\ntimer and leaves it as a Super Frenzy.\n\nQUICK MULTIBALL\nQuick Multiball is started from the Mystery Mirror.  A second ball is\nserved, or launched from the Hidden Hallway; as soon as it strikes a playfield\ntarget, the first ball is launched from the tunnel.  Until one of these balls\nis lost, all Rudy hits are worth 1M.  The clock will not advance past 11:25\nduring this period.\n\nOnce the clock reaches 11:30, if there are already two balls in the\nHidden Hallway, the game will try its best not to award Quick Multiball; it\nwill only do so if it's the only award left uncollected.  If Quick Multiball\nis hit during this time, and the clock is at 11:30 or 11:45, a normal Quick\nMultiball starts.  If Quick Multiball is hit with the clock at midnight,\nQuick Multiball and Midnight Multiball are both started; all Midnight Multiball\nrules apply, and all Rudy hits are worth 1M until all balls but one are lost.\n\nMIDNIGHT MULTIBALL\nMidnight Multiball is started by advancing the clock to midnight and then\nhitting Rudy's mouth, or by Quick Multiball.  The Trapdoor opens and the\nMillion+ light turns on; the first Trapdoor hit scores 2M and closes the\nTrapdoor.  The center ramp reopens the Trapdoor for 3M; each time the Trapdoor\nis hit its value increases by 1M (to a maximum of 10M) and the Trapdoor is\nclosed again.\n\nThe Steps and Mirror are disabled.\n\nOnce all balls but one are lost, the Trapdoor closes.  If at least one\nTrapdoor shot was made, the clock resets to 5:00 and normal play resumes.  If\nno Trapdoor shots were made, the Hidden Hallway Lock relights, and you have 12\nseconds (actually more like 24 seconds) to relock the one remaining ball.  The\nplayfield clock counts down the number of seconds remaining; nothing can stop\nthis timer.  If the ball is locked in time, another ball is served, and you\nhave one more chance at a 2-ball Midnight Multiball.  Otherwise, normal play\nresumes.\n\n3/4-WAY COMBO\nHitting the center ramp, then the right Gangway, then the Trapdoor loop\nawards the 500K 3-Way Combo.  The targets must be hit in that order, and\nquickly (so you don't have much time to spend lining up the Gangway shot).\nCenter ramp/Steps plunger/Trapdoor loop/Trapdoor loop is also an acceptable\n3-Way Combo.\n\nAfter the 3-Way Combo is hit, hitting Rudy's jaw quickly enough awards\nthe 1M 4-Way Combo.\n\nGRACE PERIOD\nWhen you shoot a ball into the Hidden Hallway lock just before Superdog/\nQuick Multiball/Midnight Multiball expires, the bonus in question usually\nremains lit for a few extra seconds, just long enough to let you take one last\nshot at the bonus once the ball is kicked out of the lock.  If this happens at\nthe very end of Midnight Multiball, and Frenzy was lit before the multiball\nstarted, hitting the Trapdoor with this last shot awards the Million+ value\nand starts Frenzy as well.\n\nEXTRA BALLS\nExtra balls are always collected by hitting the Hidden Hallway when its\nExtra Ball light is lit.  Collecting an extra ball turns off the Extra Ball\nlight, unless it's \"lit more than once\" (lighting it more than one way without\ncollecting it in between).\n\nHere are the possible ways of lighting Extra Ball:\n\n Mystery Mirror \"Extra Ball Is Lit\"--you have until the end of the game\n Steps \"Light Extra Ball\"--must be collected on that ball\n Gangway \"Light Extra Ball\"--you have until the end of the game\n\n\nDIFFICULTY OPTIONS\nThere are five standard difficulty settings for FunHouse.  The settings\nof individual features can be adjusted individually, but most operators save\ntime by using one of the standard settings.\n\nConveniently enough, the clock time at the start of the game indicates\nthe setting in use.  If it starts at 8:00, the game is on Medium settings (the\nfactory standard) and this posting should be accurate.  If the start time is\ndifferent, make the following adjustments:\n\n9:00: Your machine is Easy.  The Gangway value starts at 200K.  Light\nExtra Ball can be collected from the Steps twice, not once.\n\n10:00: Your machine is Extra-Easy.  Let me know where you live.  All the\nEasy adjustments are in effect.  You have until the end of the game to collect\nan Extra Ball lit from the Steps.\n\n7:00: Your machine is Hard.  The clock resets to 4:00 after Midnight\nMultiball, not 5:00.  When \"Extra Ball Is Lit\" is collected from the Mirror,\nyou must collect the extra ball before the end of the ball in play or it's\nlost.  The \"MIRROR\" award light does not automatically relight at the start of\neach ball.\n\n6:00: Your machine is Extra-Hard.  Take this as a compliment to your\nplaying abilities, or shoot the operator. :) The clock resets to 3:00 after\nMidnight Multiball.  The Hidden Hallway timer after an unsuccessful Midnight\nMultiball counts down much faster.  Mirror \"Extra Ball Is Lit\"s go away at the\nend of the ball.  You must advance the clock to 11:30 three times, not two, to\nlight the Special.  The \"MIRROR\" light is on at the start of each ball, but\nRudy's jaw does NOT relight the Mirror.  No lights are lit on the Steps at the\nstart of the game, and Frenzies must be collected before the end of the ball\nor they are lost.\n\n5-BALL MACHINES\nIf your machine is set for 5 balls per game, the following changes will\nhave likely been made: The clock will start at 5:00.  (Gack!)  The Gangway\nvalue starts at 100K.  Mirror extra balls must be collected before the end of\nthe ball.  The Special lights will not turn on until the clock reaches 11:30\nfor the third time.  The \"MIRROR\" light does not automatically relight at the\nstart of each ball.  The Steps ramp starts with no lights lit.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Funhouse", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/funhouse.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Funhouse", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Game Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Game Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKahler's Guide to Bally's Game Show\nPreliminary Version, as of 11/7/93\n\n\nDisclaimer: This rule sheet was (also) written completely from memory- I\nhaven't seen or played a Game Show in at least a year.  However, I played\nit many times back when it was new.  Questions, comments and additions can\nbe forwarded to me, Mike Kahler. Any usage of the\nterm Milti-Ball refers to the physical action of having Multiple\n(pin)Balls on the playfield at one time.\n\nImportant Things, in pseudo-random order\n\nFlippers Just the standard two lower, in standard size.\n\nSlingshots The usual two above the lower flippers.\n\nPlunger Standard spring loaded manual plunger.  Delivers ball to raised\nplastic field for Skill Shot.\n\nLeft/Right Inlane and Outlanes Standard setup on both sides, no Kickback\nor other save mechanism on either side.  Right inlane Lights 'SPIN' on\nwheel.  Left Inlane lights 'NUDGE'.  Well rubberized in/out posts :).\n\nWheel The wheel is made up of a circle of lamps in the lower center of\nthe playfield, such as the lightning wheel on BK2K.\n\nWheel Ramp Wide-mouthed ramp entrance is located about in the center of\nplayfield, like the placement of the ramp in Police Force.  After the\ninitial (steep) rise, the ramp takes a sharp right and makes a 270 degree\nturn, with the return path passing be low the ramp entrance and leading to\nthe left inlane.  Entrance to the loop actually passes over an open\nsection of the return path- the ball must 'clear' this crevice to make it\nthrough to the loop; if not, it will fall into the lower path and return\ndirectly to the left inlane.\n\nPop-Bumpers Two, located just below the CASH rollovers, quite obscured\nby the Wheel Ramp.\n\nC-A-S-H rollovers 4 in-line rollovers at the top of the playfield.  Each\nhas a light which can be steered (either way???) with the flippers.  The\nlane lights are repeated on the back-board of the playfield as they are\nobscured by the skill shot plastic.\n\nCollect Ramp Ramp entrance is located 2/3 way up the playfield on the\nextreme right side- it actually connects into the plunger lane ramp just\nafter it's initial rise, thus continuing to the Skill Shot playfield..\n\nCollect Saucer Located about 2/3 way up the playfield on the extreme\nleft side, just opposite the Collect Ramp entrance.  Only accessible\nthrough the Collect Ramp when Collect or Jackpot is lit.  Acts as the lock\nfor 2 ball multi-ball.\n\nSkill-Shot playfield a raised plastic field accessed by the plunger\nlane.  Located wholly above the CASH lanes and has 4 holes which drop the\nball directly into one of the 4 lanes (BATMAN sound familiar?).\n\nT-V Targets Two single targets located upward and to the left of the\nWheel Ramp entrance.\n\nT-R-U-C-K Targets Five single targets lining the Left wall, just below\nthe Collect Saucer.\n\nT-R-I-P Targets Four single targets lining the Right wall, just below\nthe Collect Ramp entrance.\n\nCAR Drop Target Located to left of CASH lanes, accessible by a shot just\nto left of the T-V targets.\n\nRear Loop Large radius two way loop around the extreme far end of the\nplayfield.  Left entrance is to the left of the CAR drop target.  Right\nentrance is hit by shot passing between the pop-bumpers and the Collect\nRamp entrance.  Each entrance has a spinner (or was it just a gate?), a\nSPOT arrow, and some other lighted features, as explained below.  A weak\nshot into the loop that doesn't make it out the other end will place the\nball above the CASH lanes.\n\nBig Bucks A sink hole located behind the CAR target.  Only accessible\nafter the CAR target has been dropped.  Ball is returned (via an under\nplayfield route) to the Right Inlane.\n\n\nPlayfield General\nGame Show has a single level playfield.  Plastic ramps for the wheel,\nskill shot and collect ramps cover a lot of the area.  There are a variety\nof shots off the flippers, ranging from the close-quarters Wheel Ramp and\nthe TV, TRUCK and TRIP targets, to th e distant Loops and CAR/Big Bucks\nshots.\n\nThe rear, vertical panel at the far end of the playfield is rimmed with\nclear bulbs, which continuously 'chase', giving the game a glitzy, game\nshow appearance.\n\nAnother noticeable thing is the large \"APPLAUSE\" studio light on top of\nthe backglass.  Lights during most major point scores, as well as randomly\nwhether the game is being played or not.\n\nThe backglass depicts the Host, an Assistant, and 4 contestants.  If\nanyone can fill in the names please do.\n\nHost: Keith McTeeth.\nAsst:\nContestants: Ms. Geri Tol,\n\nRules\nStart of game quote:\n\n\"Welcome to Game Show, I'm your host, Keith McTeeth\"\n(McTeeth is apparent from the cartoon of our host on the backglass).\n\nSkill Shot\n\nThe plunger delivers the ball to a raised field above the CASH lanes.\nObject of the Skill Shot is to hit the flashing CASH lane for X Bonus.\nThe flashing lane cannot be steered.  Bonus X's start at 2X and max at\n10X, with a step value of 1.  Because the Collect Ramp connects into the\nplunger lane, it is possible for a weak plunge to roll backwards down the\nCollect Ramp and into play.  A very weak plunge not even reaching the peak\nof the Collect Ramp will always return to the plunger.\n\nPrizes\n\nThe whole object of Game Show is to win prizes :).  To do this, you must\nlight each prize for collect, then collect them.  Once a prize is\ncollected, it cannot be collected again until all others have been\ncollected.  Prizes can be lit and collected in an y order.\n\nThere are 4 main prizes, a TV, TRUCK, TRIP and CAR.  Each prize has a\ntarget/target set associated with it.  On the multi-letter prizes, each\ntarget has a lamp noting whether that letter has been spotted.\n\nEach time a prize is completed (ie, hitting all letters in TRIP), that\nprize is lit for Collect on the Collect Ramp.  The base of the Collect\nRamp has a lamp for each prize; a flashing prize means it is ready to be\ncollected.  Steadily lit prizes have already been collected.  To help the\nflashing/steadily lit impaired, there is also a large Collect lamp at the\nentrance to the ramp which indicates if there is a prize to be collected.\n\nBesides direct hits on the prize targets, prize letters can be spotted\nindividually by traversing the rear loop in the direction indicated by the\nSPOT arrow at the entrance to the loop.  One of the two entrances will\nalways be lit; the lit side alternates with things hit like the\npop-bumpers and sling shots.  Only a full traversal of the loop counts;\nmaking it half way through then falling into the CASH lanes don't cut it.\nThe SPOTed loop direction does not change when a loop is completed, thus\ncontinuous SPOT loops can be made; a ball returning from a CCW traversal\nof the loop returning to the left flipper can immediately be shot to the\nright loop entrance for another SPOT , over and over.  It's one of those\nfast shots that just flipping when the ball nears the flipper seems to put\nit through the loop again, where it comes back to flipper again, and\nagain... (like the Freeways in High Speed or the Chase Loop in T2). Prize\nletters are SPOTed from least valuable up; TV letters are given first,\nthen TRIP, then TRUCK, then the CAR.\n\nNow to explain the seemingly simple Collect Ramp.  During the Skill Shot\nand when Collect is not lit, both the plunger and the Collect ramp will\ncontinue to the raised Skill shot field, but will be diverted from\ncontinuing to the Collect Saucer.  Only when Collect is lit will the\ndiverter allow the Collect Ramp to continue on to the Collect Saucer,\nwhere the prizes are actually collected (well, almost only.  More below).\nHowever, even if Collect is lit, a weak shot up the Collect ramp not\ncontinuing thro ugh the diverter will end up in the Skill Shot field just\nthe same (shot must have enough speed to completely bypass the entire\nSkill Shot area).  A really weak shot can sometimes land back in the\nplunger lane, just as a weak plunge can sometimes come back down the\nCollect Ramp.\n\nPrize Quotes:\n\nAs each prize is lit for collection, the assistant notes \"Collect the [ TV\n| TRIP | TRUCK | CAR ] !\".  When a single prize is collected, Keith states\n\"You've just won a [ color tv | fabulous trip | sporty new truck | shiny\nnew car ] !\".  If multiple prize s are collected in one Collect Ramp shot,\nKeith adds a little something, for example \"You've just won a fabulous\ntrip, a sporty new truck, and that's not all.... a shiny new car!\".  It's\nclearly heard that the quotes are pieced together as needed, it's always\nthe same \"You've just won...\" followed by whatever is appropriate.\nNeedless to say, the whole Game Show environment is quite amusing and the\ncorny quotes really add to the game.\n\nShowcase Bonanza\n\nShowcase Bonanza is the major prize round possible after collecting the\nabove prizes.  When the four prizes have all been lit for collect, the\nCollect Ramp is also lit for Lock. It doesn't matter if some prizes have\nbeen collected and others not; once the Collect shot has the possibility\nof completing the Collection of all four prizes, Lock is also lit.\nLuckily, if some or no prizes have been collected but the rest are lit for\ncollection, hitting the Lock/Collect Saucer will still award the full\n\"You've just won...\" sequence, followed by the Showcase Bonanza stuff.\nWould you believe Showcase Bonanza begins with the quote \"Showcase\nBonanza!\".\n\nShowcase Bonanza is a 2 ball Multi-Ball.  The second ball is served to the\nplunger immediately after the first enters the lit Lock, or after prize\ncollection quotes are finished if needed.  During Showcase Bonanza, the\nCollect Ramp is lit for Jackpot.  When the second ball is plunged, and\nuntil some switch is hit, the ramp diverter is activated so no shot\n(including the plunger shot) will continue to the Collect Saucer (where\nthe first ball is now locked).  Apon hitting any switch, the first ball is\nejected from the saucer and the diverter is de-energized so a shot up the\nCollect Ramp will continue to the Collect Saucer, where Jackpot/Showcase\nBonanza is scored. Showcase Bonanza/Jackpot starts at $3,000,000 and\nremains there for the first few seconds after Multi-ball is started.  It\nthen begins decrementing at a rate of about $100,000 every couple seconds,\nand bottoms out at $1,000,000, where it stays until collected or a ball\nis drained.\n\nShowcase Bonanza Quote: \"You just won... Showcase Bonanza!!\" (could you guess?).\n\nShowcase Bonanza can only be collected once per multi-ball.  Game play\ngoes back to normal after it is collected, even if both balls remain in\nplay.  Prizes can be lit for collection and collected.  The only\ndifference is Lock cannot and will not be lit until one ball is drained,\neven if all four prizes are collected.\n\nAnother disappointing difference is after the first Showcase Bonanza, all\nthe prize quotes are discontinued and replaced by simple sound effects.\nThis is obviously because the quotes are quite lengthy, and are only heard\nwhen the ball is waiting in the saucer, wasting precious, quarter earning\nplay time.\n\nWheel\n\nThe wheel is scattered with various amounts, ranging from something like\n$25,000 to $250,000, I think starting at the 12 O'clock position and\nincreasing clockwise.  The wheel automatically spins at the start of each\nball, placing it in a random position.\n\nThe Wheel Ramp can be lit for SPIN or NUDGE.  SPIN is lit by the Right\nInlane.  NUDGE is lit immediately after a successful SPIN and remains lit\nfor several seconds afterwards.  Merely hitting the swinging gate at the\nentrance to the ramp restarts the NUD GE timer.  Once NUDGE times out,\nSPIN must be lit off the Right Inlane to activate the Wheel again. When\nSPIN is lit, making a full loop around the Wheel Ramp spins the wheel and\nawards the newly lit value.  Making consecutive loops, before NUDGE times\nout, advances the Wheel one space, and awards that value.  As NUDGE is\nre-lit by the left inlane, where the ramp returns to, it is easy to\n'nudge' your way all the way around the Wheel.  Note to award a SPIN or\nNUDGE, the full 270 degree loop must be traversed; up the ramp and\nstraight back into the return path doesn't count.\n\nBesides the general point values around the Wheel, there are also 4(?)\nfeatures connected to 4 of the point values.  These are marked by clear,\ncircular lamps on the perimeter of the Wheel.  The values (I can remember)\nare: $1 Million, $4 Million, Lite Ex tra Ball, and Hold Bonus.  At any\ntime, one of the features will be flashing.  If the wheel lands on the\nflashing feature (by either SPIN or NUDGE), that value is also awarded\nalong with the point value of that spot on the Wheel.\n\n$1 Million awards $1 Million immediately, Quote: \"$1 Million (?)\".\n\n$4 Million (not really) lights the Left Loop entrance for $2 Million. If\nthe Left Loop is hit before the $2 Million times out, then the Right loop\nentrance is then lit for $2 Million, which also times out shortly.\nQuotes: \"Be a contestant for $2 Million, You just won.. $2 Million\"\n(repeated for Right Loop).\n\nLight Extra Ball lights the Left Loop entrance for EB, which remains lit\nfor the remainder of the ball in play. Quote: \"Get the Extra ball, Extra\nBall\" (both by the assistant).\n\nHold Bonus does just that, but in a much more noticeable way than say,\nWhite Water.  The Bonus X is carried to the next ball, or if on the last\nball, gains a second bonus count up at the end of the ball.  What actually\nmakes up the Bonus Value escapes me, but when up to 10X can be scored,\nit's worthwhile to score.\n\nOnce each feature is scored (or lit, such as the EB or $4 Million), that\nfeature remains steadily lit on the Wheel.  Only after all 4(?) awards\nhave been lit will they be available again.\n\nExtra Ball\n\nIt seems there is some other way than the Wheel to light the Extra Ball\n(at the entrance to the Left Loop).  From what I recall, it must be\nreaching 4X Bonus.  Lighting this way probably only holds for the ball in\nplay.  If scored, 5X must be reached next , then 6X, etc.\n\nBig Bucks\n\nBig Bucks is scored via the sink hole behind the CAR Target.  It begins\neach ball at $100,100.  Each time it is hit on the same ball $100,100 is\nadded to the value.  As the sink hole returns to the right flipper, it is\nquite possible to continuously hit t his shot. I faintly remember the CAR\ntarget resetting at some point, maybe after $900,900 is reached.  Can't\nsay for sure.  When it does, it essentially means 2 shots are required to\nhit the hole, one to drop the CAR, and another to hit the hole.\n\n\nTips, Tricks and Bad Things\n\n\nGame Show is quite a simple game, both in rules and playfield mechanics.\nI've never seen one not fully functional; there's only 1 lock and 1\ndiverter to go haywire.  If all the ramp switches and gates also register\nyou're in good shape.\n\nLighting prizes for Collect is easy- no difficulty in hitting any letter\nin any prize.  With additional SPOTs from the Loops, they all 4 get lit\npretty quickly.  Prizes never become any more difficult after Showcase\nBonanza's, so it's always just as easy to get a multi-ball.\n\nAs the Wheel Ramp can be hit from either flipper, it is quite easy to\n'NUDGE' the Wheel around a full circle.  It's usually best to SPIN, then\nNUDGE until the first feature is awarded, then shoot what is necessary to\nscore that feature.  By now a SPIN will be required off the Right Inlane\nto continue with the Wheel.\n\nBig Bucks is not a simple shot; the sink hole is far down a long path,\nthus requiring a good centered shot to make it all the way to the hole.\nThe score awarded isn't spectacular either, making it a less desired shot.\n\nThe Wheel Ramp is designed with the player in mind; it will never center\ndrain a ball rolling back down the initial rise.  It seems to have some\ndeformation right at the entrance that will seriously change the path of a\nreturning ball, sending it near the pivot end of one of the flippers.\n\nThe Collect Ramp is good to shoot whether lit or not; if not lit, it's an\neasy way to get into the CASH lanes, which can make a large end of ball\nbonus, as well as working towards an Extra Ball.\n\nThe Multi-Ball trick works especially well on Game Show.  Being a Bally\nmachine requires extra skill on the players behalf though.\n\nMulti-Ball trick background: After locking a ball, when the next ball\narrives at the plunger, it is possible on many games to push the plunger\ninwards, enough to push the ball off the trough switch, making the game\nthink the ball is no longer there. After some time, the game will perform\na 'ball search', eventually kicking out any locked ball to get the game\ngoing again.  This nets the player with a free ball in the plunger as well\nas (on some games) Multi-Ball mode scoring with only one ball on the\nplayfield. But Bally got a bit smarter; If a ball is served to the\nplunger, and it hits the trough switch, it will never perform a ball\nsearch even if you push the ball off the switch; it _knows_ the ball was\nput there.  So this just means you have to push the plunger in _before_\nthat second ball pops into the plunger, so it never triggers the trough\nswitch.  Easy to do, just push the plunger in as soon as you hit the\nCollect/Lock ramp when Lock is lit.  Plenty of time before the next ball\ncomes out.\n\nMulti-Ball trick awards something more on Game Show.  Holding the ball\nwith the plunger, the machine will ball search and eventually kick the\nlocked ball out of the Collect Saucer.  Once that ball hits any target,\nJackpot is ready at the Collect Ramp, meaning the diverter has been\nde-activated.  Simply plunging the ball now will pass right by the Skill\nShot playfield and drop immediately into the Collect Saucer- \"You just\nwon.. Showcase Bonanza!\" (without even trying to shoot for it, and at full\n$3,000,000 value! :).\n\nAs with any machine, for Multi-Ball trick to work, the trough switch must\nbe adjusted such that pushing in on the plunger will un-trigger it.  As\nmost games make some sound effect when the ball is plunged, you can tell\nif MB trick will work in advance.  Before plunging the first ball, press\nthe plunger in and see if the 'plunge sound' is heard.  If so, you're set\nfor MB trick later on.\n\nOn Game Show, it's possible to Lock a ball before the Lock is even lit, if\nyou want to get technical.  When the last prize is lit for Collect, if the\nLock Ramp is hit before the \"Collect the ???\" quote and animation is\nfinished, the Lock will not light, b ut as you made a valid lock shot,\nShowcase Bonanza will be awarded (after the \"You've just won..\" quotes are\nfinished).  I even recall the displays throwing in a quick 'Lock Ready'\njust after the awarding of prizes, but then it realizes you already locked\nand continues with Showcase Bonanza.  Try it sometime and you'll see what\nI mean, it's basically a noticeable lag in the update/display software.\n\nLast note- for the match, the wheel spins and gradually slows to a stop.\nHowever, the numbers on the Wheel do not relate to the match at all, it's\njust a visual clue that the match is taking place.  The actual match\nselection is shown on the displays.\n\nEnd of Game quote: \"How would you like to win fabulous prizes on Bally's\nGame Show?\"\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Game Show", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/gameshow.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Game Show", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

It can\nbe modified, updated, or revised, provided only that credit to the original\nauthor(s) remains intact.

It is something of a\nmess, however.\n\nThere are significant differences between earlier and later High Speed II\nmachines.  To the extent I can sort these out, I've tried to point them out\nin this guide.  I'm not sure, however, which differences are operator-\nsettable options, and which depend on the ROM revision.  I suspect, in fact,\nthat the rules have been changed back and forth across ROM revisions,\ninstead of necessarily progressing through a series of improvements.\n\nI use the abbreviations \"K\" for a thousand points, \"M\" for a million points,\nand \"B\" for a billion points.\n\nObjective Of The Game\nRelight the Kickback.\n\nJust kidding.  Actually, you're supposed to start Multiball by running red\nlights, and then collect Jackpots to escape from the pursuing police.\n\nImportant Things\n\nThis is a glossary of the shots and features that will be referred to during\nthe discussion of the game.  If you haven't seen the machine, this will\nprobably only confuse you.  Just take it on faith.  But then, if you haven't\nseen High Speed II by now, you truly live in Pinball Hell.\n\n\nFlippers  There are three flippers, the usual two lower ones, and an upper\nright flipper which is really only useful for shooting the left loop.  The\nright flipper button flips both right flippers at the same time - there is\nnot a two-stage mechanism to allow for holding one ball on the bottom\nflipper while shooting a Jackpot with the upper flipper.  This is a\ndisappointment compared to almost every other three flipper Williams game\n(Whirlwind, for example).  (Note: the newest revisions of the machine do\noffer a two-stage control mechanism for these flippers, and also raise the\nupper flipper automatically as part of a ball search.)\nPlunger/Shifter  This is an up/down shifter in place of the usual spring\nplunger.  It's an autolauncher, and where the ball lands in play depends\nentirely on its strength and the angle of the playfield.  It should go\naround the Left Loop and come to the upper right flipper.  All too often,\nthough, it doesn't make the loop and ends up screaming towards the Right\nOutlane.\nLeft Loop  This is a loop hit from the upper right flipper.  It loops around\nto the same flipper.  There is a Loop Champion for this shot.\nJet Bumpers  There are three Jet Bumpers at the top center of the playfield,\nabove which the two Orbit shots and the Left Loop pass.  The Jet Bumpers\nalways increase the Helicopter Bonus value, cumulative across all balls of\nall simultaneous players.\nStoplights  There are three rows of sensors, representing traffic lights.\nEach has three targets: red, yellow, and green.  Each target has a light in\nfront of it.  One row runs vertically to the right of the jet bumpers.  The\nother two rows lie along the entrance to the Left Loop.\nSupercharger  This is a large triangular loop mounted above the Jet Bumpers.\nThere is a steep ramp on the lower left portion of the playfield which\nleads into the Supercharger.  Whenever the Supercharger is \"active\",\noptical sensors and electromagnets inside a faux engine part accelerate the\nball through the loop repeatedly.  There is a diverter in the far upper\nleft corner of the Supercharger which will feed the ball to the Left\nInlane.\nLeft Orbit  This is the long shot up the left side of the machine and around\nto the upper right flipper.\nRight Orbit  This is the long shot up the right side of the machine and\naround and down the left side.  It is essentially the reverse of the Left\nOrbit, and the same non-directional sensors are used to detect both shots.\nTunnel  This is the saucer in a short lane just to the left of the Right\nOrbit shot.  It has a one-way gate to the right of it which should keep the\nball from entering the Tunnel from the Right Orbit.  Unfortunately, a\npowerful shot may bounce out of the saucer without registering.  The saucer\nkicks out to the right and feeds to the upper right flipper.\n1-2-3 Targets  These are two rows of sensors, one row above each outlane,\nturned inward at roughly a 30 degree angle.  Hitting the 1, 2, or 3 target\non either side lights that target on both sides, and targets which haven't\nbeen hit will flash.  Hitting all three before they time out (about eight\nseconds?) will relight the Kickback, whether or not it is already lit (no\nstacking the Kickback, though).  On some machines, the 1-2-3 Targets will\nalso increase the Supercharger Boost value by 1M for each hit.\nLeft Outlane  There is no rubber on the lane divider on this side.  There is\na gaping metallic scoop on this outlane, and a Kickback which should kick\nthe ball into the Tunnel.  There is a Special light here.\nKickback  This is just an excuse to have a gaping left drain.  Normal\nmachine settings do not relight the Kickback at the beginning of each ball.\nHit the 1-2-3 targets to do this.\nLeft Inlane  Going through this lane lights the Freeway on the Right Orbit.\nIf the 2X RPM light is lit (as it is at the beginning of each gear until\ncollected), the Right Orbit will award two RPM increments if hit while the\nFreeway is still lit (in fact, the grace period may be even longer).\nSlingshots  These are the usual two above the flippers.\nRight Inlane  Going through this lane lights the Freeway on the Left Orbit.\nIf the 2X Freeway light is lit (same as 2X RPM), the Left Orbit will award\ntwo Freeway increments if hit in time (except on Lock Shots, when it will\naward only one).\nRight Outlane  There is a thin metal lane divider on this side.  There is a\nSpecial light in the Outlane.\nBack Ramp  This is in the far back right corner of the game, and it comes\ndown only when a Lock or Jackpot is lit.  A firm and dead-on shot around\nthe Left Orbit or Left Loop will go up this ramp and down to the Hideout on\nthe right side of the machine.\nHideout  This is the small house on the right side of the game, above the\nplayfield, where locked balls are stored.  When Multiball begins, any balls\nhere are fed into the Right Inlane, and others are fired from the\nauto-plunger.\nFree Ride  There isn't really a playfield feature for this, except the large\nflashing light at the center drain.  If it's lit or has just gone out, you\nshould get the ball back, autolaunched from the plunger lane.  The length\nof time this is lit varies widely according to machine configuration.\nBalls which are launched after making a Lock are NOT subject to Free Ride!\n(Except for a bug on some machines...)\n\n\nGears\nThere are five gears your car can be in in High Speed II, and your current\nRPM value in your current gear determines your speed (displayed on the score\ndisplay most of the time).  You begin the game in 1st Gear, and advance to\nhigher gears by collecting RPMs or through random awards from Burn Rubber\n(see section on the Tunnel).  The RPM shots are the Right and Left Orbits,\nwhich are always lit except when you have finished a Gear and not yet shifted\nto the next Gear (this includes during Supercharger Mode).  On most machines,\nthe Speed Millions shot (which can be lit on the Left Loop) will also award\nan RPM increment, along with Million Plus.\n\nCompleting 1st Gear requires one RPM shot.  Completing 2nd requires two.\nCompleting 3rd requires three, 4th requires four, 5th requires five.  On some\nmachines (this is almost certainly operator-settable), going through the\ngears on subsequent attempts requires significantly more RPM shots for each\nGear, making it much more difficult to collect Gear Awards a second time\nthrough.\n\nThe Gear Awards are awarded as soon as you make enough RPM shots to finish a\nGear (or when the Gear is spotted by Burn Rubber).  They are:\n\n\n 1st Gear - 3 Million\n 2nd Gear - Hold Bonus\n 3rd Gear - Light Video Mode\n 4th Gear - Supercharger Mode\n 5th Gear - Light Redline Mania\n\n\nBefore you can collect any RPMs for the next higher gear, you must shift up\n(moving the shifter either direction works, and the game doesn't mind if you\nshift with your knee).  Shifting up (when lit) relights Burn Rubber.  Note\nthat if Burn Rubber is already lit, relighting it will essentially waste a\nBurn Rubber.  See \"Tunnel\" for details on Burn Rubber.\n\nShifting up increases your Bonus Multiplier, to 2X, 4X, 6X, and 8X.  The\nMultiplier resets if you do not have \"Bonus Held\" on the current ball.\n\nYou cannot shift up from 4th Gear until a couple of seconds after\nSupercharger Mode is over.  If you drain during Supercharger Mode, you\ncannot shift up (to increase your Bonus Multiplier) until the next ball.\n\nYou don't have to shift up from 5th Gear.  After Redline Mania is collected\nand over, the game will (should) shift back into 1st Gear for you.\n\nLeft Loop\nThe Left Loop is normally not lit for anything.  If you light a Lock, you can\nshoot this Loop to make the Back Ramp for the Lock.  If you go around this\nLoop once, the Speed Millions will be lit.  It will also be lit after any\nTunnel Shot.  Speed Millions starts at 1M, and remains lit for about six\nseconds (not counting grace period?) for 2M, and so on.  The Loop Champion is\nthe person who has obtained the highest value on this award.  Note that the\ngame does NOT suspend Speed Millions when it autolaunches a ball into play,\nalthough it does momentarily lift the ramp and suspend the Lock, if lit.\nThis means that with a liberal Free Ride setting, you can get a couple of\nfree Speed Millions if you dare let the ball drain quickly.\n\nOn most machines, Speed Millions also count as RPM shots, unless RPMs aren't\ncurrently available (we're at the top of a Gear).  If they don't, they become\nconsiderably less appealing to me.  This is a very difficult shot on most\nmachines, especially for repeated shots - the sweet spot is very narrow.\n\nHigh Speed II machines can develop a strange neurosis.  During Multiball,\nthey may award an indefinite Free Ride, usually three or four minutes worth.\nIt seems like you would want to shoot for Jackpots and Super Jackpots during\nthis time, but the better choice (on a machine which properly launches balls\naround the Left Loop) is to let all balls drain as quickly as possible.  Free\nRide will autolaunch them, and they will count as Speed Millions and towards\nthe Loop Champion.  You can probably get about thirty consecutive Loops this\nway before the game tires of it, which will almost certainly get you Loop\nChampion (I'm certain that this how someone got 32, by far the highest I've\nseen - I've only done seven), and it's worth about 450M.\n\nFreeway\nGoing through either inlane at any time lights the Freeway on the appropriate\nOrbit (Right for Left Inlane, and vice versa).  The Freeway Value starts at\nsome value from 1M to 4M, depending on the game's settings and the percentage\nof Extra Balls recently awarded.  If you complete the Freeway values (the\nfifth value is 5M+light Extra Ball), the Freeway will restart at 1M on\nsubsequent balls; otherwise, it restarts at the original value.  In order to\ncollect the 5M+light Extra Ball award, you must increase the Freeway value\nduring a single ball.  You can do this on every ball and collect an Extra\nBall on every ball (theoretically).\n\nMaking either RPM shot lights the Freeway shot on that side, encouraging\nrepeated Orbit shots.  This is much easier on the Right Orbit than on the\nLeft.  Note that the 2X Freeway light on the Right Inlane will award two\nincrements if you hit the Left Orbit in time.\n\nAfter collecting 5M+light Extra Ball, the Freeway is worth 5M whenever it is\nlit through the rest of that ball.\n\nRedline Mania lights an Extra Ball and sets the Freeway to 5M.  If you do\nthis before lighting an Extra Ball via the Freeway on that ball, you cannot\nlight it afterwards.\n\nStoplights\nThe Stoplights are a holdover from High Speed (so are the Freeway shots on\nthe Orbits, and the Tunnel, and the Kickback...) At the beginning of the\ngame, the green lights are flashing.  You must hit or spot all three of these\nbefore you can receive credit for hitting any yellow or red lights.  Lighting\nthe green lights will light one Lock (on the Back Ramp via the Left Orbit or\nLeft Loop), as will lighting all yellow lights and all red lights.  You can\nlight more than one Lock before collecting any of them.\n\nFor the first multiball, hitting either the Tunnel or the Supercharger (lit\nor unlit) will spot one of the current unlit Stoplights (starting with the\ntopmost bank, I believe).  This doesn't happen on any subsequent Multiballs,\nalthough there may be an operator-settable option for it.\n\nDuring Secret Mania, Supercharger Mode, and any variety of Multiball, all\nnine stoplight targets will be flashing.  Hitting all nine will normally\nlight the Extra Ball, and they will be flashing again.  I believe there's\nsome sort of limit, here - once recently I hit all nine and there were only\nvague explosion noises and the lights reset without lighting the Extra Ball.\nAnd Keefer claims he got 50M for completing the stoplights.\n\nThe Stoplight targets can sometimes become confused after Secret Mania, and\nsometimes after Redline Mania.  The worst case is when all nine lights are\nlit and the Lock is lit, but the Back Ramp refuses to come down so you can\nshoot the Lock.\n\nSupercharger\nDuring normal play, the behavior of the Supercharger is very different for\ndifferent ROM revisions.  Early machines (generally P-1 ROMs, I think) will\nincrease the Supercharger Boost value by 1M for every 1-2-3 target that gets\nhit, and completing 1-2-3 will relight the Supercharger (as well as the\nKickback).  The Supercharger Boost value in this case maxes at 10M.  I\nunderstand that the newest machines also have this rule set!  I think this\nmakes the 1-2-3 targets far too important.\n\nOn newer machines, the 1-2-3 targets have nothing to do with the Supercharger\n(they're important enough already for the Kickback).  The Supercharger is lit\nwith a 3M Boost value initially, and nothing changes that value.  Once\ncollected, hitting the inactive Supercharger (just the left ramp to feed to\nthe left inlane) twice will relight the Boost.  The Boost values are 3M, 5M,\n7M, 9M, 11M, 13M... indefinitely, cumulative over the course of one player's\ngame.  The graphics sometimes do not correctly indicate the total amount\nawarded, however.  During Multiball or other times when the Supercharger does\nnot offer Boost values, hitting it counts for the ramps needed to relight the\nBoost.  I believe you can stack these - if you need three ramps to relight\nthe Boost, and you hit eight, it will remain lit after the next time you\ncollect it.  The number of ramp hits required to relight the Boost increases\nindefinitely.\n\nThere is a Supercharger Mode at the end of 4th Gear.  This is 20 seconds\nduring which all flashing shots (loops, orbits, Tunnel, banks of targets)\nscore 5M, and the Supercharger scores 5M-PLUS.  That is, the first time\nthrough the Supercharger is 5M, the next 10M, and so on, to a limit (?) of\n25M.  These values are counted in your Supercharger Mode total, and the next\nSupercharger Mode restarts the Supercharger at 5M.  The Supercharger total is\nnotoriously inaccurate - it tends to display the points you scored plus\npoints that were scored in Supercharger Modes of previous players in previous\ngames.  It wraps around at 255M (it's an 8-bit counter), and then displayed\ntotals are 4M, 9M, etc.\n\nOn some machines, the Supercharger does not stop at 25M during Supercharger\nMode.  Go figure.\n\nHitting an inactive Supercharger (ie, the left ramp by itself) awards the\nSpeed Bonus, which is your current speed x 1K points.  If you've just\nfinished 5th Gear, you may receive 0,000 points for this, which is rather\namusing but harmless.\n\nDuring Multiball, the Supercharger behaves very differently.  See the section\non Multiball for details.\n\nStrange behavior from the Supercharger... depending on the tuning of the\noptical sensors and electromagnets in your game, the Supercharger may either\nbe a bit slow (no big deal) or a bit fast.  If it's a bit fast, a ball that\nloops many times may come around to the upper left before the diverter can\nopen the left return ramp.  This will send the ball back down the ramp,\neither towards the center drain or towards the top of the right slingshot.\n\nDuring Multiball, you can get more than one ball into the Supercharger at a\ntime.  This easily causes collisions which can send balls flying across the\nplayfield.  On some (older) machines, this can send balls flying into the\nback of the playfield, where there's a nice hole which lets them land in the\nbottom of the cabinet with a thoroughly depressing \"thud\".\n\nTunnel\nThe Tunnel is where Burn Rubber is collected, the Helicopter Bonus is\ncollected, Video Mode is collected, the Extra Ball is collected, Tunnel\nShots are counted, and balls can be held for roughly eight seconds during\nMultiball.\n\nYou begin the game with zero Tunnel Shots.  Every time you hit the Tunnel,\nfor whatever award, you are credited with a Tunnel Shot, cumulative over the\ncourse of one player's game.  Collecting some adjustable number of Tunnel\nShots (usually 8, but possibly as high as 14) will light the Special lights\non the outlanes.  Both outlanes light and they remain lit until your game\nends or either one is collected.  Another Special will be lit at an\nadditional fifty Tunnel Shots beyond the first Special.  On most older\nmachines, lighting any Special in a multiplayer game will make that Special\nunavailable to the other players.  This is true for all subsequent Specials,\nwhich are lit at every next fifty Tunnel Shots.\n\nBurn Rubber is a random award like those found on many Bally and Williams\ngames.  It is lit at the beginning of the game, and every time you shift up\nafter completing a Gear, it is relit.  The first time you hit it, you will\nsee an animation of a map, with a marked path headed towards your random\naward.  The map includes such stops as \"Chicago\" and \"Smallville\", but you'll\nnever collect these awards - they're just window dressing.  Subsequent Burn\nRubber awards will simply be displayed without a map.  Awards include:\n\n\n Relight Kickback\n Bonus Held\n 1M, 3M, 5M, 10M\n Lite Lock\n RPM\n Freeway\n Spot Gear\n Video Mode\n Multiball\n Extra Ball\n Special\n\n\nSome of these awards become \"invisible\" if hitting the Tunnel also completes\nthe current Stoplight color and lights a Lock for you; the machine will\ndisplay the stoplight status and \"LOCK IS LIT\" instead of the award.\nLuckily, most of the awards obscured in this fashion are RPMs and Spot Gear\n(never Video Mode, for example).\n\nSometimes the \"RPM\" award is labeled \"2X\" on the display.  This may be when\nthe Left Inlane is lit or has been triggered but not yet timed out.\n\nIf Multiball is awarded, Multiball begins immediately, launching any locked\nballs you or any other player may have, and autolaunching the other balls\n(for a total of three) from the plunger lane.  See Multiball.\n\nSpot Gear is an especially nice award when you've just gotten into 5th Gear.\nIt saves you quite a few RPM shots.  On the down side, if you haven't lit the\nExtra Ball on the Freeway values yet, you'll now have to go to a special\neffort to light it, while avoiding the reasonable temptation to just go ahead\nwith Redline Mania.\n\nThe Extra Ball can be lit on the Tunnel by completing the Freeway Values,\nhitting all nine Stoplights during any Mania or Multiball, or by collecting\nRedline Mania.  Contrary to my earlier beliefs (and again, this may vary from\nmachine to machine, like everything else about High Speed II, including its\nname, its playfield layout, and its tachometer!), any number of Extra Balls\ncan be lit here at one time.\n\nThe Extra Ball takes precedence over other awards, except the Helicopter\nBonus.  Next is Video Mode, followed by Burn Rubber, if lit.  If nothing is\nlit and there is nothing else to be displayed at the time, you will see an\nanimation of your car driving into a tunnel, followed by a display of current\nnumber of Tunnel Shots and number needed to light Special.\n\nFor information on the Helicopter Bonus, see the section on Multiball.\n\nVideo Mode\nVideo Mode is lit by completing 3rd Gear.  It remains lit until you collect\nit.  If you go all the way through to the end of 3rd Gear again without\ncollecting it, it does not \"stack\".  It can also be awarded at random by Burn\nRubber, although I believe it will not do so on the same shot that collects a\nlit Video Mode.\n\nIn Video Mode, you steer your car across three lanes filled with slow-moving\nVolkswagen Bugs.  Your current Gear determines the speed at which this\nhappens.  You start in 3rd Gear.  If you shift up to 5th Gear immediately and\ncomplete Video Mode, you will collect roughly 26.5-27.5M easy points.\nCompleting Video Mode in 4th Gear is worth roughly 16-20M points.  It's worth\nthe trouble to improve your skills to do Video Mode in 5th Gear.  Note that\n1st Gear is almost impossible!\n\nThe best and most common strategy is to straddle the line between the\nleftmost pair of lanes.  You can steer by holding the flipper buttons in\n(pressing more than one will give precedence to the most recently pressed\nbutton); there is no need to tap them repeatedly.  If the machine is set up\nfor it or has been giving out very few Extra Balls recently, there will often\nbe an Extra Ball target in the far lane, instead of one of the Bugs.  It's\nmore or less impossible to see this target and head for it; if you expect it\nwill come up, you may wish to anticipate its appearance (usually about 1/3 to\n1/2 of the way through the Video Mode).  Just drive through it to collect it.\n\nMultiball\nMultiball is mostly the point of High Speed II.  Although you can do very\nwell simply by hitting RPMs, Freeways, collecting Gears and Burn Rubbers,\nyou'll find that it's hard to avoid lighting Locks, and they can get in the\nway if you don't collect them.  With a well-setup machine and careful play,\nMultiball can be very lucrative.  Besides, it's extremely cool.\n\nThere are three ways to start Multiball.  The \"normal\" way is to light all\nthree Locks and lock all three balls.  Another way is through a random award\nfrom Burn Rubber, which I believe is much more likely if the machine has been\nhaving very few \"normal\" Multiballs during recent games.  The third way is to\ncollect Redline Mania after completing 5th Gear.  See the section on Redline\nMania for information on what makes it different from other Multiballs.\n\nThe first lock provides an animation of your car pulling up to a scantily\nclad female (presumably a hitchhiker) on the highway.  She usually says,\n\"Nice wheels\" or \"Nice car\" and you say \"Hop in\".\n\nThe second lock provides an animation of your car screeching to a halt in\nfront of Donut Heaven, where one to four police cars are parked.  If there\nare three... read the section on Secret Mania.\n\nThe second \"normal\" Multiball is slightly different.  On the first lock, your\ncar pulls up in front of Donut Heaven, and Car 504 says, \"This time I'm gonna\nnail that dirtbag.\"  Functionally, everything's the same, but this gives you\ntwice as many chances to start Secret Mania.\n\nLater Multiballs have no hitchhiker - just quick animations of Donut Heaven.\n\nWhen you have the red light completed and two balls already locked (virtually\nor actually), the game will repeatedly flash \"RUN THE RED LIGHT\".  When you\nlock this third ball, there is an animation of your car tearing through a red\nlight at which Car 504 is parked.\n\n\"Dispatch, this is Car 504.  Suspect ran a red light, over.\"\n\"Roger, 504, apprehend 'em.\"\n\nDuring Multiball (slightly different for Redline Mania), ten loops through\nthe Supercharger are required to light the Jackpot, which is always worth\n25M.  Putting a ball into the Supercharger will make it loop ten times.  If\nyou put another ball in far enough to hit the lower optical sensor, the game\nwill think there are two balls, and will loop the ball(s) for twenty loops.\nIf you actually have two in there, this usually registers twenty-one loops.\nIf you send the ball past the first optical sensor and then it trips it on\nthe way down as well (assuming any running balls don't get in the way), the\ngame will think that all three balls are in there, and you will receive\nthirty loops before the ball(s) are returned.  If you hit the Supercharger\nduring Multiball and the diverter fails to operate properly, the ball will\nreturn to the Left Inlane, and you will be immediately credited with having\nmade ten loops.\n\nNote that the game can be tricked into thinking there are three balls in the\nSupercharger even when you have only two balls in play!\n\nOn subsequent Multiballs, lighting the regular Jackpot will require ten more\nloops for each time you have collected it previously.  The maximum number of\nloops required to light any Jackpot is twenty.  The maximum number of loops\nrequired to light any Super Jackpot is fifty.\n\nWhen you light the Jackpot, the back ramp comes down and is worth 25M.\nCollecting the Jackpot will enable you to shoot the Supercharger to light the\nSuper Jackpot.  This will always require at least twenty loops.  The Super\nJackpot is (or should be) 50M, followed by 75M, 100M, and so on without limit\n(I know of 675M, and have personally collected 175M).  Note that you must\nkeep at least two balls in play while lighting and collecting Super Jackpot.\n\n\"Dispatch, this is 504.  Suspect got away.\"\n\"He WHAT?!\"\n\"HE - GOT - AWAY!!\"\n\n\"504, you are authorized to use lethal force.\"\n\"Damn, they're shootin' at us!\"\n\nIf all but one ball drain while you are still shooting to light or collect\nthe regular Jackpot, you will have 20 seconds (configurable?) of Getaway\nTime, during which you can light and collect the Jackpot as normal.  There is\nan extremely brief grace period for the Super Jackpot - if a ball is found in\nthe Hideout just after the other balls have drained, you will be awarded a\nSuper Jackpot of \"base value\", which may be less than the lit value if you\nare in Redline Mania.  It's all very complicated and inconsistent, but Keefer\nthinks he understands it.  Bug him at \"keefer@rahul.net\" about this.\n\nHitting a ball into the Tunnel during Multiball will credit you with a\nTunnel Shot, and the ball will sit there for roughly eight seconds.  When it\ndoes kick out, you have a relatively clean shot at the Jackpot on the Left\nLoop (top flipper).  If you are in Getaway Time, the ball will kick out\nimmediately so that you can shoot for the Jackpot (well, if it isn't lit\nright then, you can't really shoot for it...).\n\nHitting all nine Stoplight targets during Multiball, as in Secret Mania, will\nlight the Extra Ball.\n\nThere is a Free Ride on Multiball on most machines, although it is usually\nvery short.  (There's a bug, though, described above...)\n\nAfter you have collected the regular \"Getaway\" Jackpot and while you still\nhave at least two balls in play, shooting a ball into the Tunnel will award\nthe Helicopter Bonus.  This is when a police helicopter tries to follow you\ninto the tunnel, and crashes into the mountain.  I've seen the Helicopter\nBonus up to 75M, so this can be significantly more valuable than the Getaway\nJackpot itself.  Yes, points for blowing up police helicopters.  I guess it's\n\"OK\" because they shoot at you first, right?  Copkiller, indeed.\n\n\"Where'd he go?\"\n\"He went in the tunnel--\"\n\"HEY!  LOOK OUT!!\"\n<<crash>>\n\"Chopper, you out there?\"\n\nRedline Mania\nRedline Mania is lit by completing 5th Gear.  It's the red light on the\nSupercharger entrance.  Hit the Supercharger to collect it.  It awards the\nfollowing (not necessarily in order...)\n\n\n 10M\n Extra Ball is Lit\n Freeway at 5M\n All Targets 500K\n Kickback is Lit\n Jackpot is Lit\n Super Jackpot at 100M\n Multiball\n\n\nRedline Mania is a normal Multiball, except that no loops are required to\nlight the initial Jackpot, all targets are worth 500K, and the Super Jackpot\nbegins at 100M (with no corresponding increase in the number of loops\nrequired to light it).  It's generally best to collect Redline Mania after\nlighting the Extra Ball on the Freeway, because you cannot light it after\ncollecting Redline Mania.  Because the Super Jackpot is so much more valuable\nin Redline Mania, it's very important to get the regular Jackpot out of the\nway, preferably on one of the two free shots you'll get (either from the\nHideout or the auto-plunger, depending on whether or not any balls were\nactually locked), and then shoot for lighting and collecting the 100M Super\nJackpot as if it were the regular Jackpot.\n\nIf you've previously collected a 100M Super Jackpot or higher, the starting\nvalue for the Super Jackpot in Redline Mania will be 25M more than the\nhighest collected Super Jackpot value.\n\nSecret Mania\nSecret Mania is essentially a Frenzy mode that was thrown into the game, and\nit isn't integrated very well (IMHO).  Any time you see the animation of your\ncar in front of Donut Heaven and there are three police cars parked there\n(the number seems to have some pattern, and it also seems to be random - go\nfigure), shift Up and Down a couple of times quickly.  This will give you 20\nseconds of Secret Mania, during which all targets are worth 500K, as in\nRedline Mania.\n\nIn Tournament Mode, there are always three cars at Donut Heaven.\n\nThere are several problems with Secret Mania.  First of all, the lighting\nscheme is extremely tricky for twenty seconds - all lights flash in\nalternating pairs.  You may find it difficult to even survive Secret Mania.\nSecond, it's not especially point rich.  The most I've heard of is about 21M,\nand that's still less than a simple Video Mode, and Video Modes have no risk\nassociated with them at all.\n\nWorst of all, the game becomes confused about the state of the locks for\nMultiball after Secret Mania, especially in a multiplayer game.  Typically,\nthe machine completely resets the Stoplights to flashing green, although it\nremembers where you were on locks.  It's not uncommon to see the game saying\n\"RUN THE RED LIGHT\" while the green Stoplights are flashing.  Run the green\nlight, I'd say.\n\nThe advantages of Secret Mania are that you can light an Extra Ball by\ncompleting the stoplights, and you essentially get another lock lit for\nfree... sometimes.\n\nIt's possible to get the game into a state where Locks are lit but the Back\nRamp won't come down to accept the balls.  This is frustrating, to say the\nleast.  Another glitch is that after one player has a Multiball, other\nplayers may find that balls they lock, although counted, are always fed to\nthem out of the Hideout, whether that is appropriate or not.  This can be a\nbit startling if you've turned away to sign autographs or whatever ;)\n\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\nMy basic strategy is to go through Gears, unless the Locks are especially\neasy on the machine (ie, the Left Orbit and Left Loop are easy shots to make\nsolidly).  It's not unwise to collect Burn Rubber in between Gears, but don't\nfret if you miss a couple - the biggest points are in the top end of the\nGears, and if you get in a rhythm shooting Freeways, those are usually more\nimportant than one Burn Rubber (they light the Extra Ball).\n\nThe biggest cause of ball drains in High Speed II, without question (assuming\nyou don't just flail around and let them go out everywhere), is the gaping\nleft drain.  It's even worse on machines which have been thoughtfully set up\nwith a left lean (I think that if operators want to make a game harder, they\nshould fiddle with software settings, and to a certain degree, the Tilt\nsensitivity).  The worst thing about a left drain is that once it happens,\nyou're in immediate danger of having another on the next ball.  A game that\nis going fantastically well, with, say, five Extra Balls waiting, can be over\nin sixty seconds if you start having problems with the Left Outlane.\n\nTherefore, you should concentrate on shooting the 1-2-3 targets to relight\nthe Kickback, right?  Well, sort of.  If you're close to Redline Mania, shoot\nfor that instead (it relights the Kickback), because aiming for the 1-2-3\ntargets tends to put the ball into the most dangerous areas for outlane\ndrains - a ball which heads towards the 3 target on the left is pretty much a\ngoner.  Also, Burn Rubber can relight the Kickback sometimes.  It's probably\nintended as an insult, but I've come to be very appreciative of this award\nrecently.\n\nMy Video Mode strategy is described above, under Video Mode.\n\nMy Supercharger Mode strategy mostly depends on what I'm doing when I happen\nto complete 4th Gear.  Preferably, I have the ball on the lower right\nflipper.  Shoot the Supercharger for 5M.  Hold the left flipper up, push the\nmachine forward as the ball comes down, bouncing it over to the right\nflipper.  Shoot the Supercharger for 10M.  Repeat until you miss and have to\ndo something desperate, or until Supercharger Mode ends.  It doesn't truly\nend until you see the \"Supercharger Total\" message on the screen.  (The\nSupercharger Total is usually very, very wrong; ignore it.) If this isn't\npossible, try to do repeated Right Orbits - they're still worth the Freeway\nvalue plus the 5M per Orbit.  If you light the Extra Ball during Supercharger\nMode, there is no message.  If you shoot the Tunnel for a lit Extra Ball\nduring Supercharger Mode, it does pause and award the Extra Ball.  A third\nalternative for Supercharger Mode is to shoot Speed Millions on the Left\nLoop, although on some machines it will not track them for Loop Champion in\nthis mode!  Note that the Tunnel will not award Video Mode or Burn Rubber\nduring Supercharger Mode.\n\nI always try to light the Extra Ball before collecting Redline Mania, in\norder to get two Extra Balls for the price of one ball in play.  In Redline\nMania or Multiball, try to get balls to whichever right flipper you have an\neasier time shooting Jackpots with.  If the flippers come up steeply on your\nmachine, you can probably backhand balls into the Supercharger.  This can be\nextremely useful during Multiball (or for collecting Redline Mania).\n\nOne somewhat tricky shot worth perfecting is the Right Orbit, repeatedly.\nI've managed as many as nine of these in a row - it's a slightly easier shot\nthan the Left Loop for Speed Millions, it awards the same RPMs, and it awards\nand increases the Freeway value.  Plus, it's the shot to make for the 2X RPM\nduring each gear.  The safest way to roll through the Left Inlane is to hit\nthe Supercharger - it feeds to that inlane.  With enough practice, you should\nbe able to slap balls around the Right Orbit until it takes a funny bounce on\nthe way down.  Don't forget to shift while you're doing this at an insane\nspeed ;)\n\nThe problem with Speed Millions is that the \"sweet spot\" on the upper right\nflipper is extremely small.  Worse yet, a missed shot will usually dribble\nabout on the lower stoplight targets and head towards the right outlane.\nAlthough there's enough rubber over there to help you out, and Death Saves\naren't impossible, it's still dangerous.  If Speed Millions don't interest\nyou or aren't lit or you don't want to shoot a lit Lock, just let the ball\nfall when it passes the upper right flipper.  It should go past the right\nslingshot (without triggering it) and come to the lower right flipper in a\ngood position for shooting the Supercharger or Left Orbit.  A dead catch is\nworkable here, but be careful - with the ball headed towards the left\nalready, the ball will tend to spin towards the center drain.  Just holding\nthe flipper up may lob it up towards the right outlane you were trying to\navoid in the first place.  In short, it's best to master an on-the-run slap\nshot up the Supercharger or around the Left Orbit (harder).\n\nA slow ball from the upper flipper will catch the post beneath the entrance\nfrom the plunger lane and head towards the left flipper or the drain.\nWhoops.\n\nOn newer machines, Speed Millions and RPMs on the Left Orbit are NOT awarded\nwhen the Lock is lit.  Neither is the left Freeway value, but if you roll\nover the lit 2X Freeway target in the right inlane first, it will award ONE\nFreeway value when you make the Lock.  There's actually a very good reason\nnot to award RPMs when locking a ball - on older machines, it was possible to\nstart Supercharger Mode (at the end of 4th Gear) at the same time you ran the\nred light to start Multiball.  This would result in a mode where you couldn't\nlight the Jackpot, ever!  Or at least, that's what happened on the P-B ROM\nmachine I discovered this problem on.  You still had twenty seconds of\nSupercharger Mode, but the Supercharger never did any loops after that.\nEventually, Multiball comes to an end, nothing gained.\n\nOn some older machines, Redline Mania counts as a \"normal\" Multiball in the\nsense that it \"erases\" any locks you had previously.  On newer machines, it\ndoesn't do this.  This may be what is leading to unusual situations where the\nLock is lit but the Back Ramp won't come down.\n\nQuotes\n\n \"Dispatch, run a make on license plate KINGPIN.\"\n \"Choppers, can you see the suspect?\"\n \"Roger, dispatch, I see him.\"\n \"Choppers, head to 504's location.\"\n \"What kind of car IS that, anyway?!\"\n \"Alright, up against the car, buddy.

You shoot for all the lit ingredients, then shoot the\nramp a lot of times.  Really.  Sounds like as much fun as an (old) DE\ngame...*\n\nI think it's especially stupid that the ONLY way to get multiball is by\na lucky lagoon award.  At least multiball isn't worth that much (1M per\nramp shot while you have both balls).\n\nAlso, this is another game that suffers from unbalanced scoring...\nEverything is OK until you get to that stupid 50M shot...  sheesh.\nNow that I think about it, I think that a simple million+ (or say 2 or\neven 3 million+) would have been a much much better implementation.\n\nBut like I said, get the stuff for Kona and shoot the ramp.  However,\nthere are a couple of little tips I can give you, other than that\nrather obvious strategy:  Watch the kickback value!!!  This is\nprobably the second-most important thing, since you can get a bonus\nball from it.  Just keep a careful eye on which return lane a ball will\ngo into, and use the flippers to change the \"advance kickback value\"\nlight into that lane.  However, once you get to bonus ball, avoid\nhitting a lit return lane at all costs (or you have to start over).\nNotice that advance kickback can either be in the left return lane,\nthe right return lane, or off totally.  After getting it to bonus ball,\na good idea would be to leave it off as much as you can.  The only\nother important shot is the \"skill shot\" saucer, which you can also\nshoot into via a shot up the lane when the ramp is raised.  (Note that\nthat same shot all the way around the saucer is your bonus-x shot.)\nSometimes you can change the value of the saucer when the ball is\nheading for it.  Always choose (or aim for) light kickback.  If it's\nalready on, it'll spot recipe, like the 3rd light.  Don't worry about\nthe jungle runs...  They're bwee compared to the value of getting to\nKona or the kickback (they max at 5M and 2.5M).\n\nSo that's it.  Master the ingredient shots and the ramp, and the score\nis yours.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Gilligan's Island", "possible_shots": "lit ingredients, ramp, lucky lagoon award, kickback value, skill shot saucer, bonus-x shot, jungle runs", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/gilligansisland.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Gilligan's Island", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Gladiators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Gladiators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladiators by Gottlieb/Premier\n\n\nWell, here it is.  Just as I'm posting it I realized I didn't put in\na section on game quotes, but none of the quotes are particularly funny.\nThe game just tells you what to do (\"shoot the ramp\", \"shoot the spinner\",\n\"one more for multi\", \"shoot the ball\" if you don't plunge the ball within\nabout 10 seconds, \"make the right choice\" for the weapon choice, and\n\"shoot again\" if you activate the ball saver) and what you've done\n(\"jackpot\", \"super/ultimate jackpot\", \"50 million\" for hitting the catapult\nsaucer near the end of a timed catapult round, \"next round 2 x\" when\nthis is awarded, and all the mode names.) There are probably a couple more\nthat I've left out.\n\nPlayfield Layout:\nVarious things divide the playfield into an upper and lower half, and I\nthink that's a convenient way to describe it.  Across the top we have:\n\n\nThe M ramp.  At the far left side of the machine, the entrance to the\nM ramp is just below the upper half of the playfield.  The M ramp is the\nfirst of 5 shots needed to spell MULTI.  Hitting this ramp results\nin the ball coming down into the upper playfield through a habitrail\n\"crane\".  Sometimes this moves back and forth, but other times it is\nstill, and when it is still, sometimes the ball will drop into a saucer\n(which I will call the attack or catapult saucer.)\n\nThe loop.  To the right of the M ramp is a loop.  If the ball is hit hard\nenough into one side of the loop it will come out of the other side.  The left\nside of the loop is the U shot, while the right side is the L shot.\nThe crane swings back and forth above these two shots, and the catapult\nsaucer is right in front of the post separating the U and L shots.  There are\nalso 2 upper flippers.  The right flipper is situated to hit the L shot,\nwhile the left flipper lies parallel with the left side of the U shot, thus,\nyou can't normally use it to hit the U shot.  The U shot tends to be reachable\nfrom the lower right flipper, but not from the lower left flipper because\nthe upper left flipper doesn't get down fast enough to allow such a shot.\nI've also managed to hit this shot from the upper right flipper.\n\nThe T ramp.  To the right of that other stuff is a curved ramp which exits\nvia a habitrail that send the ball flying directly down toward the lower\nflippers.  Similar to the way the ball comes out of the raptor pit on\nJurassic Park, except that the T ramp never sends the ball SDTM.\nThe entrance to the T ramp faces toward the upper left flipper, and in\ngeneral this is the only way to hit the ball up this ramp hard enough to make\nit go all the way around.   The upper right flipper lies parallel with the\nbottom edge of the entrance to the T ramp.\n\nThe bumpers.  Just above the entrance to the T ramp is the entrance to an\nenclosed area containing 3 pop bumpers.  This is also the only exit from this\narea, although the skill shot and the I shot feed to the mystery saucer\njust above these bumpers, which kicks the ball out into the bumpers.\n\nThe I shot.  At the right side of the playfield is the entrance to the I shot.\nThis is a long lane (not a ramp -- it is level with the rest of the playfield)\nwhich contains a spinner, and leads to the mystery saucer.  Before the spinner\nthere is a path to the left which leads to the abyss saucer, and a funny,\nbouncy attempt at the I shot will sometimes send the ball there.  If the I\nis not lit for spelling MULTI, usually the saucer will be lit for a mystery\naward.  The plunger sends the ball into this lane at a point above the spinner.\n\nThe abyss saucer.  This saucer is located below the upper right flipper.\nIt can also be reached from the I lane, as described above.  Since the upper\nright flipper doesn't \"close\" all the way, an errant attempt at shooting the\nT ramp can instead pin the ball between the upper right flipper and the\npiece of the playfield below it, and raising the right flipper allows the\nball to fall into the abyss.  The abyss kicks the ball up into a habitrail\nthat leads down to the lower playfield.\n\nThe catapult saucer.  The saucer is just in front of the post separating the\nU and L shots.  It is \"open\", meaning that there is no shield which intends\nto hold the ball here when it passes by, so many attempts to hit the saucer\neither fly past it, or bounce off the post.  This saucer kicks the ball out\ndown and to the right, so that it lands on the upper right flipper.  If that\nflipper is raised, the ball may go below the flipper into the abyss, it may\nhit the flipper and go back to the catapult or just bounce away somewhere,\nor it may go _above_ the right flipper anyway.\n\nMB target.  At the left side of the lower playfield, below the entrance to\nthe M ramp, is the MB target.  Hitting this target lights 3 lights in front\nof it, labeled \"1\", \"2\", \"Light MB\".  When MB is lit the next mode will be\n2-ball multiball instead of 15-seconds timed, and will end when one ball\ndrains.\n\nDrop targets O'death.  To the right of the entrance to the U and L shots\nis a set of 3 drop targets. (They are in front of a playfield piece that\npartially surrounds the abyss saucer.) The left target advances a series of\n5 blue lights, and the right target advances a series of 5 yellow lights.\nThese lights are also advanced by hitting the slingshots.  When the lights are\nat the same level, the attack mode starts.  Direct hits on these drop\ntargets from the lower flippers tend to send the ball SDTM, thus my name\nfor them.\n\nMode saucer.  Above the right inlane is another saucer.  Unlike the catapult\nsaucer, this one is designed to try to catch the ball when it gets near.\nUnless you're already in a mode or multiball, hitting the mode saucer starts\nthe next mode (pyramid round).  This saucer kicks the ball out into the right\ninlane.\n\nSlingshots.  The slingshots are smaller than usual, but in the normal place.\nThe piece of the slingshot that kicks the ball is larger than normal.  Hitting\neither slingshot advances one set of the attack lights (see drop targets\no'death)\n\nInlanes.  There is a fairly normal looking set of inlanes and outlanes,\nexcept that the inlanes have little gates at the top that prevent the ball\nfrom going out through the top of the inlanes, so that it can't roll out into\nthe outlane.  This looks to me to be a design change just to keep the\nball from rolling over into the outlane; can anybody tell me if the beta\ngames had these?\n\n\nBelow the outlanes, on the panels containing the rule card, are two sets of\nLEDs which keep spell WEAPON and DOUBLE.  These carry over from ball to ball,\nand game to game.\n\nFinally, the play of the game!\n\nThe skill shot gives you a choice of three options, shown by three lights in\nthe plunger lane.  The ball goes into the I lane and around to the mystery\nsaucer.  The ball must stop in the mystery saucer to be awarded the skill shot.\nOn the machine I play, a full strength plunge is too strong, and the ball\nbounces back out of the saucer and down the I lane, while a 3/4 strength\nshot works fine.\n\nSkill shot choices:\n\n\n Advance weapon - advances one letter in WEAPON, lighting the weapon shot at the abyss if this completes WEAPON.\n Advance multi - advances one letter in MULTI, locking the ball and starting multiball if this completes MULTI.\n Start round - starts the next pyramid round.\n\n\nThere is a ball saver which lasts about 10 seconds at the beginning of each\nball.  If the ball saver is activated, you don't get a skill shot on the\nnew plunge.\n\nMULTIBALL:\nThere are 5 labeled shots that spell MULTI (as described above).  At the\nbeginning of the game the M shot is lit, and hitting it will light the U,\netc.  Hitting the lit I shot lights the mystery saucer for multiball, and\nsince the I lane leads to the mystery saucer, a good I shot starts multiball.\nThe spinner itself is the I shot, so it is possible to light the lock without\nlocking the ball - this is generally a bad thing, since you still need a\ngood I shot to start multiball, and the lit lock goes away when the ball\ndrains, leaving you to start over at M again.\n\nDuring multiball, the object is to first hit the M ramp for a jackpot\nworth 20 million.  The ball will be held while you try to send the second\nball up the M ramp for another 20 million.  If you take too long, the first\nball will be released again, and you can continue to try for jackpots on the\nM ramp.  If you succeed in getting both balls locked at the top of the M\nramp, they will then be released from the crane directly to the upper\nleft flipper.  If you send one ball up the T ramp, and it goes all the way\naround, this scores a super jackpot of 100 million.  If you also manage to\nsend the second ball up the T ramp, it scores an ultimate jackpot of 200\nmillion.  These last two jackpots are timed, so you will only get a couple\nof chances at them.  After all but one ball drains, multiball ends and the\nMULTI lights are reset.  Normally the MULTI lights stay on after the shots\nare hit, but after the second multiball, the lights go back one step if you\ndon't hit the next one within about 10-15 seconds, making it much harder to\nget multiball.\n\nPyramid rounds:\nHitting \"start round\" on the skill shot, getting awarded \"start round\"\nby the mystery shot, or putting the ball in the mode saucer when you\nare not already in a pyramid round or multiball will start the next round\non the pyramid.  There are six rounds in three rows: rain of terror,\ncatapult, and fire and ice on the bottom row, cataclysm and blade fight on\nthe middle row, and calm before the storm at the top.  Initially rain of\nterror is flashing, but the pop bumpers change the flashing round among\nthe uncompleted ones at the current row.  While in a pyramid round, you\ncan't add MULTI or WEAPON letters, but you can use almost all the other\nfeatures: combo shots, attack mode, abyss shots, and adding DOUBLE letters.\nEach of the first 5 rounds normally lasts for 15 seconds, but if MB has been\nlit (by hitting the MB target 3 times) then a multiball is started, and the\nround lasts until 1 ball drains.  Calm before the storm is always a multiball.\nAfter calm before the storm ends, the entire pyramid flashes.  The next round\nis the beast challenge, described below.\n\nThe rounds:\n\nRain of terror.  The abyss is lit for 5 million points, and the pop\nbumpers are worth 500,000 per hit (normally they're worth about 10 points).\n\nCatapult.  The M ramp is worth 2 or 3 million points.  The crane i\nswinging back and forth, and if by some miracle the ball lands in the\ncatapult saucer, you score 50 million points.  The 50 million can also\nbe scored by hitting the ball into the saucer without going through the\nM ramp, and it can be scored more than once.  Each catapult saucer shot\nalso advances DOUBLE, unless it's already complete. (This saucer normally\nadvances DOUBLE at any time.)\n\nFire and ice.  The M, U, L, and T shots are lit, and each one hit scores\n3 million.  Hitting all 4 before time runs out scores a 30 million bonus,\nand relights the shots.\n\nCataclysm.  Starting this mode adds 5 million to your cataclysm bonus.  Two\nof the 5 MULTI shots will be lit.  Each lit shot adds 5 million to the\ncataclysm bonus.  After each 5 seconds, the lit shots change.  The cataclysm\nbonus is cumulative throughout the game, and is added to your score in the\nbonus at the end of each ball.\n\nBladefight.  Each time you clear the 3 drop targets you score 5 million\npoints.\n\nCalm before the storm.  If this mode is started from the mode saucer, it\nwill be a 3 ball multiball, and the first plunged ball will be locked\nin the mystery saucer before the balls are released.  If the mode is started\nfrom the skill shot or mystery \"start round\" award, it is only a 2 ball\nmultiball.  The mega-bonus starts at 30 million, and each time one of\nthe MULTI shots is hit, 3 million is added to the mega-bonus.  Like all\nmultiballs, calm before the storm ends when only one ball is left in play.\nThe mega-bonus is awarded after each successful beast shot in beast\nchallenge, and is added to your score at the end of the game if you\nplayed calm before the storm at least once.\n\nBeast challenge.  There is a 3-headed flying beast attacking you, and you\nneed to hit 3 hard shots in order to chop off its 3 heads.  The first shot\nis the mystery saucer, the second is the abyss, and the third is the\ncatapult saucer.  Each shot adds your mega-bonus to your score.  If you\nhit all 3 shots you have killed the beast.  After your mega-bonus counts\ndown, you get to enter your initials (during the middle of the game!)\nas a beast slayer, and a SPECIAL is awarded.  The round ends, and the pyramid\nis cleared, so you start over with rain of terror, etc.  If the ball drains,\nthe round ends, and only the top 3 modes on the pyramid are cleared.  I don't\nknow if lighting MB will give you a 2-ball beast challenge or not.\n\n\nAttack mode:\nEach hit of the left drop target or left slingshot advances the blue light\none position in a set of 5 lights.  The right drop target and right slingshot\nsimilarly advance the yellow lights.  When the lit blue and yellow lights\nare side by side, the \"attack\" mode begins.  As you would expect, this happens\nquite often.  In the attack mode, the M ramp is worth 3 million, and it locks\nthe ball.  Pressing a flipper releases the ball through the crane (which is\nswinging back and forth), and a carefully timed release will drop the ball\ninto the catapult saucer for 30 million.  The 30 million can also be scored\nby simply hitting the saucer without going through the M ramp.  The mode\nends when the 30 million is collected, or after a timer (I think 15 seconds)\nexpires.\n\nDOUBLE:\nEach hit of the catapult saucer advances the DOUBLE lights.  When DOUBLE is\ncompleted, then \"everything doubled\" is lit, and all scoring for the rest of\nthe ball is doubled.  Extra balls are also doubled, and perhaps the\nspecial from beast challenge would also be doubled.\n\nAbyss:\nDropping the ball into the abyss adds 1 abyss shot.  For every 2 abyss shots,\nthe next-round multiplier is advanced - the game says \"next round 2 x.\"\n(or 3x if you advance it twice before playing a round.)  All the scoring in\nthe next pyramid round will be doubled.  If \"everything doubled\" is also lit,\nyou can actually get 4x or 6x during a round.  Some HUGE catapult scores can\nbe made this way.\n\nWEAPON:\nThe U and L shots light alternately to advance WEAPON.  When WEAPON is\ncompleted, the weapon shot is lit at the abyss.  When the weapon shot\nis hit, a menu of choices appears.  The first time the choices are\nmultiball (the same as if you completed MULTI), 10 million points,\nor cataclysm (the same as if you started cataclysm round from the mode\nsaucer or the skill shot - if you had not already completed cataclysm then\nit is lit on the pyramid).  The second and third times the options\nare \"? score\", 30 million, or \"? feature\".  I don't know what the ? feature\nis; I've chosen it and nothing happened except for the next round 2 x\nfrom hitting an abyss shot.\n\nCombo shots:\nIf no combo shot was lit, then hitting any of the MULTI shots lights another\none (which should be reachable after the first shot) as a combo shot.  Hitting\nthe combo shot adds one to your combo shot total, and scores 500,000 points,\nand lights another combo shot.  Hitting consecutive combo shots doubles the\npoint bonus for each shot, so it is possible to get a 16 million point combo\nshot, or maybe better - I don't know what the limit is on this doubling.\nA certain number of total combo shots for the game awards an extra ball.\nThe factory default is 26, but this is too high and auto-adjusts to values\naround 11 to 17.  After this, a 50 million point bonus is awarded for\ngetting twice that many combo shots, and finally 70 million is awarded at\n90 combo shots (this number does not vary).\n\nMystery saucer:\nUsually, if you're not in a round or multiball, and the I shot is not lit,\nthen the mystery saucer will be lit for a mystery award.  Awards I've seen\ninclude \"Start round\", \"next round 2x\", \"start multiball\", point values\nsuch as 1 million, 5 million, \"hurry-up extra ball\" (at the abyss), \"hurry-\nup special\" (at the T ramp), and ZERO.  ZERO usually comes up if you're\nalready doing quite well in the game.\n\nM-T extra ball:\nThere are sets of LEDs over the entrance to the M ramp and behind the T ramp\nthat track how many times you've hit them in this ball.  If you hit\neach one 4 times in the same ball then an extra ball is lit at the abyss.\n\nAcu-spin:\nSometimes the spinner lights for acu-spin.  When the ball goes through the\nspinner the total number of spins and the acu-spin number is displayed.\nIf the spinner stops after exactly the right number of spins, then an\nextra ball is awarded.  If it doesn't make enough spins, you can hit it\nagain to try to get the right number of spins.  The only time I actually\nmanaged to get this extra ball was a weak I shot, which gave about 3 more\nspins when it came back down, making the right number of spins.\n\nOutlane bonus:\nWhen a ball goes out one of the outlanes a mystery point bonus is\nawarded. I've seen 500,000, 1 million, 2M, 3M, 4M, 5M, 10M, 20M, and 50M.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nThere is an extra ball buy-in for 1 quarter/token/whatever coin.  Unlike\nearlier games with an extra-ball buy-in, you cannot use credits for the\nbuy-in.  The game I play costs 50 cents per credit, but only a quarter\nfor the buy in.  Also, the buy-in is offered more than once - I know it's\noffered at least three times, but if you get into the top 5 scores, you\nmust end your game and enter initials.\n\nAt the end of the game, the DOUBLE letters are advanced once.  If this\ncompletes DOUBLE, then your score for the entire game is doubled.  However,\nif this doubling would give you a replay, or put your score into the high\nscore list, then it will not advance DOUBLE.\n\nIf the ball is in the pop bumpers, you can get it out by holding both\nflippers - this turns off the bumpers.  This is a good idea when a timed\nround has just started, and you can also hold the next round this way,\nif, for example, you have 2x or 3x next round lit, and you want the next\nround to be catapult.\n\nSometimes, the game will get confused, and the display will go blank for\na few seconds, and when it returns it will be scrambled.  The text is usually\nin German, and the score is either not displayed at all, or is jumbled.\nAfter a while, or at the end of the ball, the display will usually return\nto normal, although it once happened to me on my last ball and the\nextra ball buy-in screen was asking me to insert 1 mark for an extra ball.\n(Seriously!)  This tends to happen after a game has gone on for a while,\nso you're usually just noticing that the game is going well when it happens.\nIt seems (from discussion on rgp) that all Gladiators games do this.\n\nIf there's anything I left out let me know.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Gladiators", "possible_shots": "M ramp, loop (U shot, L shot), T ramp, bumpers, I shot, abyss saucer, catapult saucer, MB target, drop targets O'death, mode saucer, slingshots, inlanes, outlanes, LEDs spell WEAPON and DOUBLE", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb/Premier", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/gladiators.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Gladiators", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

The theme is licensed from the latest\nJames Bond movie Goldeneye, the first which features Pierce Brosnan\nas 007.\n\nThe major toy in this game is a rotating Satellite with a magnet in\nits center capable of catching and holding a pinball.  The player\ncan load the Satellite via a Pop-Up Ramp which rises up from the\nplayfield.  Also of note is the Ball Saver, which consists of a\nmagnet system which catches and flings the ball away from the\nouthole and back into play.  The effect is similar to that found in\nthe lock mechanism of the Williams/Bally game The Shadow.\n\nThe playfield contains 3 relatively easy ramps, which is a departure\nfrom earlier Segas which typically contain fewer and more difficult\nramps.  As a result, the game flows better and contains a more\nattractive shot selection.  My biggest gripe with this game is the\nRight Ramp return's tendency to allow the ball to hop into the\noutlane rather than the inlane.  There is currently no compensation\nfor this.\n\nOverall, I believe this game to be one of Sega's best efforts to\ndate.  The Satellite is genuinely fun, the Ball Saver effect is\ncool, and the rules are innovative (see Satellite Multiball, Eject\nor Die).  The sound system on this game could have been better; the\nmusic is repetitive and cheap sounding.  The display is the smaller\nsize used on Apollo 13, but it still can show movie clips and\nactors' faces believably.  The game is also chock full of Easter\nEggs if you look hard enough.\n\nMachine Vital Stats\nThese rules are based on a machine with 4.02 ROMs.\n\nPlayfield\n\nFlippers\nTwo in the standard positions.  They seem to have Goldeneye-\nspecific markings, which is a little unusual.\n\nSlingshots\nYawn.\n\nOuthole\nCollect Bonus :)  Also the location of the coolest ball saver\never, even if it was \"inspired\" by The Shadow.  The ball is\ncaught and held by a magnet, and then flung into play.  This\nworks even if the ball went down an outlane first.  If the ball\nis not caught by the magnet for whatever reason, the game plunges\nanother ball.  There even seems to be a custom animation for just\nthis occasion; Boris is frozen (\"Freeze!\") and cracks into bits.\n\nSeveral other events will trigger the ball saver, such as an\nimmediate drain off of the Center Eject Target or the standup to\nthe right of the Lock Ramp.  There's also a short ball saver\nafter the Mode Start Lane kickout, and maybe some others.  Not\nenough is done, IMHO, to notify the player that their ball is\nbeing saved.  There's no quote, no animation, and not even the\n\"Shoot Again\" light comes on.  Be sure and check that your ball\nis well and truly drained before walking away.\n\n\nNow moving clockwise around the playfield:\n\n\nLeft inlane\nUnder certain conditions, this will trigger a Pop-up Ramp that\ngives you a shot at the Satellite.  The best way to get the ball\nto this inlane is the Far Left Ramp.\n\nThis inlane has 2 switches; one parallel to the inlane\nand one parallel to the flipper.  The higher switch\nis the one that activates the Satellite Ramp when ready.  \n\nLeft outlane\nEject or Die when lit.\n\nShootout Bank\nThis bank consists of 4 standup targets; 3 large white and 1 small yellow\nbetween the 2nd and 3rd white targets.  During single-ball non-\nmode play, shoot all 3 white targets to light Shootout at the\nsmall yellow target.  Shoot the small yellow target to start\nShootout.  Completing Shootout is required to advance towards the\nWizard Mode.\n\nFar Left Ramp\nA shallow ramp which feeds the Left Inlane.  This is the best\nway to set up a shot at the Satellite.  This is also a Jackpot\nshot.\n\nThis ramp can be backhanded (!) on the 2 machines I've\nplayed.\n\nRamp Standups\nTwo green targets on either side of the Lock Ramp entrance.\nAlong with the four targets on the Satellite Bank, these make up\nthe 6 Guard targets.  Immediately draining off of the right\nstandup will be compensated with a ball saver.\n\nLock Ramp\nA less shallow ramp which feeds the Right Inlane.  When lit, this\nawards a Virtual Lock.  Two Virtual Locks are required to light\nSatellite Multiball.  This is also a Jackpot shot.\n\nThis ramp can also be backhanded.\n\nMode Start Lane\nA small lane most easily hit from the right flipper.  The lane\nends in a small hole, from which the ball is then kicked out.\nThere is a short ball saver after this kickout, I think.  This\nlane is used to start 007 Encounters (i.e. modes) and collect\nMystery.  This is also a Jackpot shot.  Completing all 5 modes is\nrequired to advance towards the Wizard Mode.\n\nCenter Eject Target\nA large circular, mirror-like standup located in the\ncenter of the game.  It is used to\ncollect Extra Balls, light Vitural Locks, light Tank Multiball,\nand can save your life in Eject or Die.  There is a short ball\nsaver for draining immediately after hitting this target.\n\n007 Top Lanes\n3 top rollovers, \"0\" \"0\" \"7\".  Complete all three to increase\nBonus X.  Note that there is a large delay between collecting a\nlane and being able to collect another, and that you can't\ncollect a lane during any multiball.  Completing the rollovers\nis required to advance towards the Wizard Mode.\n\nThe only way to hit these rollovers other than from a launched\nball is to shoot the bumpers and -hope- the ball goes\nup a lane.  This is important if you do something like\ncollect all the Wizard items except 007 on your first ball.\nKind of a shame.\n\nBumpers\n3 bumpers, worth 250K / hit.  Balls leaving the bumper area will\nexit between the Center Eject Target and the Satellite Bank.\n\nSatellite Bank\nA bank of 4 green Guard targets and a white Satellite Value\ntarget.  Not that the Satellite Value target has anything to do\nwith the value of shots to the Satellite.  It toggles the value\nof the award you get when completing the Guard targets in single\nball play.\n\nPop-Up Ramp\nA steep ramp that raises up in front of the Satellite Bank in\ncertain situations.  It is triggered by the Left Inlane.  After\nhitting this ramp, the ball will sail through the air and\nhopefully get stuck on the center of the Satellite.  If not, it\nwill probably hit the glass and could land just about anywhere.\n\nSatellite\nA large white rotating dish with a magnet in the center.  Shoot\nthe magnet via the Pop-Up Ramp, and the ball will stay there\nuntil either the magnet lets it go or you knock it away with\nanother ball (see Satellite Multiball).\n\nRight Ramp\nA large ramp which loops all the way around the playfield, and\ncan either drop the ball into the bumpers (on a weak shot), load\nthe tank (during certain modes), or feed the left inlane.\n\nUnfortunately, it could also potentially feed the outlane.  On\nfast shots (and even medium shots), the ball can pop out of the\nball return and roll down the outlane, not even hitting the\noutlane switch.  There is no compensation for this at this time.\n\nQ Targets\nA white and a blue target on the lower right side of the game.\nHit the white target 3 times to start Q's Pen mode.  Finishing\nQ's Pen is required to advance towards the Wizard mode.\n\nCollect Bonus Lane\nA small lane above the right in/out lanes which leads to the\nplunger lane.  Making this lane in single ball play will award\nthe multiplied Bonus value.\n\nRight Outlane\nEject or Die when lit.\n\nRight Inlane\nLights Mystery at the Mode Start Lane for a short time.\n\n\n007 Encounters (Modes)\n\nThere are 5 modes which can be started at the Mode Start Lane.\nYou cannot start one mode while in another.  In non-mode single ball\nplay, the bumpers cycle the currently lit mode.  I believe that\nthere is a short ball saver right after the mode kickout.  10M\nis automatically added to your Mode Total, displayed after the mode\nends (with the exception of Xenia Extra Ball).\n\nYou need only to start and end each mode in order to advance towards\nthe Wizard Mode; you don't actually have to complete any of them.\n\nIt's interesting that during Goldeneye's modes, successive shots\nscore -less- points, instead of -more- points like they do\nin preceding Sega games.\n\n\nXenia Extra Ball\nThe Center Eject Target is lit for a hurry-up extra ball.  You\nhave 15? seconds to hit the target, which is usually more than\nenough.  One shot to the Eject target ends the mode.\n\nThe graphics during this mode are, well, graphic, regardless of\nwhether you complete it or not.  Xenia is strangling someone to\ndeath during the hurry-up, and completing it means that his\neyeball pops out, which not completing it means that his entire\nhead pops off.  Yum!\nSatellite Hurryup\nThe Left Inlane raises the Pop-Up Ramp for a shot at the\nSatellite.  The value starts at 90M, and counts down by 5M's\nuntil 10M? and then quits.  One shot to the Satellite ends the\nmode.  One thing to note: I've made a shot at the last possible\nmoment, and it stuck to the Satellite but didn't give me the\naward.  Harumph!\n\nNerve Gas Plant\nComplete all 6 Guard Targets, and then shoot the Lock Ramp within\n30 seconds.  The 1st target is worth 25M, the second 20M, and\nsubsequent targets are worth 15M each.  Targets you have already\nhit seem to be worth 1M each.  Once you make all the targets,\nshoot the lock ramp for a whopping 30M.  This is a lot of work\nfor a possible 150M points or so.\n\nTrain/Tank Multiball\nA 2-ball multiball with an initial ball saver.  The Far Left Ramp\nstarts lit, shooting it lights the Right Ramp, and making that\nlights the Far Left Ramp, and so on back and forth.  Note that\nshots to the Right Ramp are loaded into the Tank and then fed\nback to the Right Inlane, so the two ramps feed each other.\n\nThe first shot is worth 30M, the second 25M, then 20M, 15M, and\n10M.  Not sure what happens after that, but the pattern can't go\nfor much further before your score starts to go down :)\n\nSend Spike\nShoot either the Lock Ramp or the Right Ramp to send a \"spike\"\nand make connections to more cities on the displayed world map.\nBoth ramps are loopable, so it is best to just pick one and shoot\nit over and over.  You have 30 seconds to complete the mode, and\nI am guessing that 7 shots or so would be enough.  I can't recall\nright now how much shots are worth, but they are in the 20-30M\nrange I think.\n\n\nShootout\n\nComplete all 3 white standups on the Shootout Bank in non-mode\nsingle ball play to light the yellow \"Shootout\" target.  Shoot the\nyellow target to start Shootout.\n\nFunky music starts, 3 strange-eyed guards appear on the display, and\nJames encourages you to \"Shoot to Kill!\"  It's up to you to figure\nout how to finish the mode; I'll leave instructions for the\nimpatient in the Spoilers section.  You'll kick yourself.\n\nFinishing Shootout is worth 30M?, but more importantly lights the\noutlanes for Eject or Die, which can come in very handy indeed.\nYou also need to finish Shootout in order to advance towards the\nWizard Mode, which is even handier.\n\nEject or Die\n\nCompleting Shootout lights Eject or Die at the outlanes, which can\nonly be collected during single ball play.  If you drain down the\ncenter or during multiball, Eject or Die will still be there on your\nnext ball.  If you drain down either outlane with Eject or Die lit\nduring single ball play, the ball is grabbed by the ball saver\nmagnet and the fun begins.\n\nThe ball is flung into play, and you have -6- seconds to hit the\nCenter Eject Target or your ball is -over-.  You're only going to\nhave to time to make one, maybe two attempts at the target, assuming\nthat the ball makes it to the flippers in 6 seconds.  Thankfully,\nthe timer seems to stop while in the bumper area.\n\nRegardless of whether you \"Eject\" and your ball continues, or you\n\"DIE\" as clearly indicated on the display, that uses up 1 Eject or\nDie.  You can stack them by getting multiple Shootouts, which may\nnot be such a bad idea.\n\nOn a strange note, I once saw someone hit the Eject target -just-\nafter the timer had expired.  The ball sailed SDTM, but was saved\nby the rebound-from-center-target ball saver.  But this wasn't very\nhelpful, because the flippers had already been disabled and DIE was\nflashing on the backglass.  Sounds like a bug-ish feature to me...\n\nGOLDENEYE\n\nYou're probably noticed, if you've played the game, that the word\nGOLDENEYE is spelled in lamps just below the display.  Don't worry,\nthis isn't an Apollo 13-style indicator that holds over between\nplayers and games; it's separate for each player and each game.\n\nShoot the ramps during single ball non-mode play in order to spot\nletters in GOLDENEYE.  The letters start to flash once you get\nclose, which I think is a nice touch.\n\nSpelling GOLDENEYE starts hurry-ups at the 3 ramps.  You are given\n10M for starting the mode.  They all start at 50M, and count down\n1M per second down to 20M before expiring.  If you collect all 3,\nthe Left Inlane will raise the Pop-Up Ramp for a shot at the\nSatellite.  Do it quickly, because it won't give you much time.\nMaking the shot will award your hurry-up points (+10 M) -again-.\nSo completing the whole sequence is worth a maximum possible 320M.\nYou're going to lose a few million on the hurry-ups, so your\nrealistic best is going to be around 310M.  Still, this is a very\nlarge sum in comparison to most of the other game features.  You\nneed to spell GOLDENEYE to advance towards the Wizard Mode.\n\nCombos\n\nIn single ball non-mode play, making a ramp lights one or more of\nthe others for a possible Combo.  Making the Far Left or Right Ramp\nlights the Right Ramp for a Combo, and making the Lock Ramp lights\nthe Far Left and Lock Ramps.\n\nThe first combo is worth 10M, and successive combos are worth an\nadditional 2M each time (12M, 14M, 16M, etc.).  The values start\nover at 10M once the sequence of ramps is broken.\n\nGuard Award\n\nIn single ball play, collecting all 6 Guard Targets awards the\ncurrent Satellite Value.  The Satellite Value is toggled by shooting\nthe Satellite Value Target, and can be 10M (unlit), 25M, 50M, 75M,\nor 100M.  I think this works in all modes except Train/Tank\nMultiball and Nerve Gas Plant.\n\nMystery\n\nDuring single ball non-mode play, the Right Inlane lights the Mode\nStart Lane for Mystery.  Shoot the Lane within a few seconds to\ncollect Mystery.\n\nI've only seen Mystery be 10M or 2X.  Note that 2X does not give you\nthe 007 Top Lanes light to advance towards Wizard Mode.\n\nQ's Pen\n\nAt the start of each ball, the white Q Target is unlit.  Shoot once\nfor it to be lit, shoot again for it to blink, and shoot a third\ntime to start Q's Pen mode.  This only works during single ball\nnon-mode play.\n\nOnce Q's Pen is started, you have 14 seconds to hit the Q Target\nBank 3 times.  If you make the 1st or 2nd shot with 0-2 seconds\nleft, you'll get a very brief extension (3 secs?).  You get 10M for starting\nthe mode, 10M for the first hit, 20M for the second, and 30M for the\nthird.\n\nYou need to successfully finish Q's Pen in order to advance towards\nthe Wizard Mode.  This is the most common (for me, anyway) item to\nbe missing.\n\nLighting Multiball\n\nThere are two ways of lighting multiball; one involves shooting the\nCenter Eject Target to light the Lock Ramp for Virtual locks, and\nthen collecting Virtual locks.  The other involves draining without\ndoing any work until Ball 3 starts.  If you haven't gotten multiball\nby the start of Ball 3, the game will light both Satellite and Tank\nMultiball.\n\nIf you want to do it the hard way, shoot the Center Eject Target\nuntil the Lock Ramp is lit for a Virtual Lock.  You only need one\nhit for your first two multiballs; then you need 2 hits to start the\nthird.  Not sure after that.\n\nCollect two Virtual Locks to light Satellite Multiball.  The top left\ninlane switch will raise the Pop-Up Ramp for a shot at the rotating\nSatellite dish.  You need to get the ball on the magnet in the\ncenter of the dish in order to start Satellite Multiball.\n\nWhile Satellite Multiball is lit, if you hit the Center Eject\nTarget, the Right Ramp will be lit for Tank Multiball.  If you hit\nit again, the Mode Start Lane will also be lit for Tank Multiball.\n\nTank Multiball\n\nTank multiball is a 4? ball multiball with a short ball saver.  The\n3 ramps and the Mode Start Lane are lit for Jackpot, which is cycled\nby hitting any of the Guard Targets.  The Jackpot value can be 10M\n(unlit), 25M, 50M, 75M, or 100M.  The best way to get high-scoring\njackpots is to get the value up to 100M and then not miss any\njackpot shots :)  Upon collecting all 4 jackpots, they are relit\nfor another go.\n\nIf you manage to drain all but one ball before making -any- jackpot\nshots, you can restart Tank Multiball by shooting the Right Ramp\nwithin 20? seconds.\n\nSatellite Multiball is cooler.  And more lucrative.  So starting\nTank Multiball can be kind of a drag.  Fortunately, you can -cancel-\nit by pulling the trigger during the tank animation.  Satellite\nMultiball will continue to be lit.  You can relight shots to start\nTank Multiball by shooting the Center Eject Target, in case it turns\nout that you really did want to play it for some reason.\n\nSatellite Multiball\n\nSatellite Multiball is a 4? ball multiball (not counting the one\nstuck to the Satellite) with a short ball saver.  The 3 ramps and\nMode Start Lane are lit for Jackpots, and score just like in Tank\nMultiball.\n\nIf you complete all 4 jackpots without dropping below 2 balls in\nplay, the Left Inlane will raise the Pop-Up Ramp for a shot to knock\nthe ball -out- of the Satellite!  This is pretty cool, and is worth\na very cool 200M if you make it.\n\nAlso, upon finishing your game, you get to put in your initials as\nthe last player to collect the Satellite Jackpot.  The initials are\nshown during attract mode, and maybe somewhere else too...\n\nIf you get down to 1 ball before completing the jackpots or knocking\nthe ball out of the Satellite, then the Satellite ball is returned\nto you to automatically continue multiball!  This is amazingly\nhandy, and I'm kind of surprised that nobody had ever thought of\ndoing something like this before.\n\nOnce you knock the ball out of the Satellite (or it comes out on its\nown and you complete the jackpots), then the Super Jackpot is lit.\nIt's a roving jackpot that automatically cycles between the four\njackpot shots.  It's worth 150M, which seems strange right after\npicking up 200M for the Satellite shot.\n\nAfter the Super Jackpot, the four regular jackpots are lit, and\ncompleting them leads to another SJ, and so forth.\n\nIf you somehow manage to miss all the jackpots, drain all but one\nball, get the extra Satellite ball, and drain -another- ball before\nshooting a jackpot, you get ANOTHER restart chance.  Shoot the Right\nRamp to start Tank Multiball.  You can't abort it.  You should be\ngrateful to be in multiball at all :)\n\nBonus\n\nYour base bonus is the sum of your ramp shots plus your Mode Start\nLane shots, multiplied by 1M.  If you fail to make any of these\nshots, you are given a 1M pity bonus.  Your base bonus is multiplied\nby your bonus multiplier for your bonus value, which is displayed at\nthe end of your ball or after getting Collect Bonus.  You don't get\nto see what your base bonus or your multiplier is, you are only\nshown the final product.\n\nInteractions\n\nYou can light and start multiball during any 007 Encounter,\nShootout, Goldeneye ramp hurryups, and/or Q's Pen.  The running mode\nwill pause and resume once multiball is over.\n\nYou can play Shootout, Q's Pen, and/or the Goldeneye ramp hurryups\nduring a 007 Encounter, but you can only start them during non-mode\nplay.  You can start and play Shootout, Q's Pen, or the Goldeneye\nramp hurryups while any of the others is running, assuming that no\n007 Encounter is running.\n\nThe Train/Tank Multiball 007 Encounter will pause other running\nfeatures just like Satellite or Tank Multiball.\n\nAll features also continue to run during Eject or Die.  I'm not sure\nif you can start features, but you should be spending your time\ngoing for the Eject Target anyway, so it shouldn't matter to you :)\n\nIf you are prone to high blood pressure, do not start Eject or Die\nduring the Extra Ball hurryup -- one target means 0 balls or 2 balls\nand you have only a few seconds to hit it ... no pressure ...\n\nWizard Mode (the difficult-to-achieve award)\n\nTo light Goldeneye's wizard mode, you must complete the following in\nany order:  Start and end (but not necessarily successfully\ncomplete) all 5 modes, complete the 007 Top Lanes, finish Shootout,\nsuccessfully complete Q's Pen, and spell GOLDENEYE.  You'll know\nwhen it's lit when the 5 mode indicators start flashing.  Start the\nwizard mode at the Start Mode Lane.\n\nWhat happens now?  Find out yourself!  Once you've done it, feel\nfree to check the Spoilers below for more info.  But not until then.\nIt won't be as exciting or feel as good your first time through\nif you've already read about how the mode works.\n\nNovice Mode / Regular Game\n\nUpon starting the game, you have 8 seconds to decide between\nNovice Mode and Regular Game.  Novice Mode means that you are\nguaranteed an infinite number of balls (no penalty for drains) for\n2 minutes.  Then your next drain will be your last (unless you have\nan extra ball or Eject or Die).  Regular Mode is a more conventional\nstyle game, and is automatically selected if you don't pick one.\n\nWizard Mode (not the award, the type of game you can start)\n\nTo enable, press the left?/right? flipper while pressing Start.\nI didn't notice anything different, but I only tried it once.\n\nLeague Play\n\nTo enable, press the right?/left? flipper while pressing Start.\nI haven't been able to pin down if this does anything other than\nshow the sum total of players 1 & 3 and 2 & 4 during a 4-player\ngame.  I wonder if Mystery award are the same, not that it would\nreally matter that much.\n\nThwacker\n\nThere isn't one, presumably to cut costs.  When you get a replay,\na very loud BLOP sound comes from the speakers.  The first time I\nheard it, I thought the sound system had crashed or the speakers had\nblown or something.  It was, and continues to be, somewhat\nunnerving.  It does get the message across to the rest of the arcade\nthat you've won a credit, and specifically that you won it on\nGoldeneye.  I'll be interested to see if Twister, Sega's next game,\nalso uses this feature.\n\nBuy-ins\n\nThere don't seem to be any.  I'm not sure if this is an option the\noperator can enable or not.\n\nCredits\n\nCredits for the creation of this rule sheet are due for:\n\n\n Chris Hehman\n Steve Lane\n Lea Armentrout \n others in the Triangle Pinball League\n and those on rec.games.pinball who helped answer questions.\nThanks, guys!\n\n\nCredits for the creation of the pinball game are available in the\nattract mode.  I'd like to include them here, schedule permitting.\n\nMore Work Needed\n\nThere are a number of as-of-yet-unanswered questions in this rule\nsheet, some numbers which are not entirely known for certain, and\nprobably some outright errors.  Please mail corrections to me, or\npost them or rec.games.pinball .  If you have corrections to the\nspoilers, please include a spoiler warning as below when posting to\nr.g.p.\n\nEaster Egg Hunt\n\nGoldeneye is chock full of hidden or subtle tidbits.  Yes, there is\na cow.  Here's a checklist of things you should look for:\n\n\nA cow\nYour initials -during- the game, not in the Attract\nMode or in the Instant Info.  Well, they're somebody's\ninitials.  They could be yours if you've done well\nrecently.\nThe word POW!\nA dinosaur\nThe word CHICAGO\n\n\nThere's more, too, but this should get you started.  If you've found\nthem all, give yourself a large pat on the back.\n\nSpoilers\n\nBelow I've included how to complete Shootout, a description of the\nWizard Mode (the difficult award), a strategy guide, and the answers\nto the above Easter Egg Hunt (along with a bunch more not on the\nchecklist).\nI included 25 or so blank lines or so between each item so you can\navoid spoiling the surprise on certain features.  Now go away, and\ndon't come back until you've made a good-faith effort to figure this\nout all on your own.\n\nI said go away!  If you don't leave now, you'll see how Shootout\nworks...\n\nEditor's note: 25 blank lines removed.\n\nShootout\n\nJames is telling you to \"Shoot to Kill\" ... well, what do you shoot\npeople with ... the game comes equipped with one ...\n\nYou'll need 6 presses to finish Shootout, 2 for each guard.  The\nfirst shot is 2M, then 4M, 6M, 8M, 10M, and then Eject or Die is\nlit.  I -told- you that you would kick yourself.\n\nWizard Mode spoiler approaching...\n\nEditor's note: 25 blank lines removed.\n\nWizard Mode\n\nThe difficult-to-achieve Wizard Mode is called *GOLDENEYE!*, with\nasterisks and an exclamation point, I presume, to distinguish it\nfrom the GOLDENEYE ramp hurryup thingy.  All 5? balls are kicked\nout, with a short-if-any ball saver.  *GOLDENEYE!* ends when you\nare down to 1 ball.\nAll switches are worth 3M/hit, and ramps are worth 20M.  But the\nmost important thing is that every 50 switches, a new ball is\nadded into play.  There is no spinner in this game, so pop\nbumpers are the best way to rack up lots of switch hits.  Keeping\nthe balls in play seems to be more important than making ramp\nshots.\n\nOnce *GOLDENEYE!* is over, you can start 007 Encounters again.\n\nStrategy hints following this spoiler...\n\nEditor's note: 25 blank lines removed.\n\nStrategy\n\nStarting *GOLDENEYE!* should be your primary goal in the game.\nSatellite Multiball is a nice source of quick points, but the wizard\nmode can be worth quite a bit more.  And since Xenia Extra Ball is\nthe only source of Extra Balls in the whole game, and you can only\nplay the modes again after the wizard mode, there is an added\nincentive.\n\nEject or Die can save your life many times over, and is especially\nimportant given the absence of a kickback.  Since you can stack the\nEject or Die awards, completing Shootout a few times can be a very\ngood idea.  During Eject or Die, concentrate your efforts on making\none good shot at the Center Eject Target.  It's not that hard of a\nshot, so don't rush it more than you have to.\n\nTank Multiball is less valuable than Satellite Multiball, so you\nshould usually abort it.  If you desperately need only a few points,\nit might be safer to just play Tank Multiball than risk the chance\nof not getting Satellite Multiball.\n\nThe GOLDENEYE ramp hurryup sequence can be worth quite a lot, if you\nmake the finishing Satellite shot.  300M is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nDon't play Q's Pen any more than you have to.  It's difficult, it's\nnot worth much, and it's potentially hazardous.  If you need to make\na shot at the Q Target Bank from the right flipper, try banking the\nball of the lower part of the Shootout bank into the Q targets.\n\nMost of the modes aren't worth the effort.  If one of the other\nfeatures is running (that you started before starting the mode),\nit's almost always better to do that first.  The obvious exception\nis the hurry-up extra ball mode.\n\nAvoid hard shot to the Right Ramp if your machine is prone to\noutlane hops.\n\nIn Multiball, don't spend too much time worrying about the current\njackpot value.  Especially in Satellite Multiball, when you have a\nguaranteed 150M SJ shot available after every 4 jackpots.\n\nEaster Egg spoiler follows....\n\nEditor's note: 25 blank lines removed.\n\nEaster Egg Hunt Hints\n\n\nAt the beginning of the game, before Player 001 plunges his/her\nfirst ball, James walks across the display, turns, fires, and\nkills whomever was looking through the camera lens.

Riot is now explained in full detail.\n\nMultiball Completed chart of jackpot values.\n\nOther Corrected how to relight the Kickback.  Added info on the ball saver,\nthe SNAKE sequence, and bumper scoring.\n\nStrategies Wrote some!\n\n\nThanx to Mark Phaedrus and Noel Steere for their help with this revision!\n\nIntroduction\nThese rules are based on version 2.00 CPU/2.00 Display.\n\nGuns 'n Roses (GnR for short) is the Data East pin following \"WWF Royal\nRumble.\"  It is a widebody machine, and has a tall plastic GnR logo on top of\nthe backbox.  The gameplay rules are pretty straightforward, following the\ntrend of WWF, but there are more side awards to go for during the game than in\nWWF.\n\nThe distinctive feature of the game is the Rose Plunger, which is placed\nsimilarly to the left-side plunger in FunHouse.  Its handle is made in the\nshape of a rose, which, along with the gun shaped autoplunger, ties in nicely\nwith the GnR theme.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nI'll start at the lower left corner and go clockwise.\n\n\nLeft Outlane Has a kickback.  When the kickback is on, the white light labeled\n\"Patience\" will be lit.  This is the fairest kickback scoop I've ever seen!\nSince the kickback sends the ball up the middle of the board to the Bumpers,\nthe outlane is only gently curved.  There's rubber on the lane divider, and\nthe outlane itself isn't huge, so nudging a ball out of the outlane is\nfairly easy to do.\n\nLeft Inlane This lane lights the right ramp for a short time during normal\nplay.\n\nLeft Drop Targets These are placed above the Left Outlane.  Their position is\nsimilar to the standups on TNG, but the drops are turned counterclockwise a\nbit to face the middle of the board, rather than the slingshot.\n\nUpper Flipper This flipper is in exactly the same spot as the upper flipper on\nTommy, that is, at the entrance to the Left Orbit.  It can hit the Captive\nBall, Mini Loop, and the Center Scoop.\n\nLeft Orbit This is only a half-orbit, since a ball shot up this lane will be\ndeflected down to the Rollover Lanes by a one-way gate.  There is a switch\nnear the curved part of the Orbit, which you must hit to get credit for a\nshot to the Orbit.\n\nGuitar This is a saucer obscured from view by the big G Ramp.  It's the mode\nstart shot.  If you duck down, you'll see that there is a very narrow metal\nlane that starts about halfway past the entrance to the G Ramp, which tries\nto guide the ball into the saucer.  I've found that hard shots from the\nright flipper sometimes bounce out of the saucer.  The ball is kicked into\nthe Left Orbit and rolls to the Upper Flipper.\n\nCaptive Ball area The ball rests to the left of the G Ramp entrance.  It rolls\nup a short lane to a small round open area.  Along the curved top wall of\nthat area are the D-U-F-F standups.  There is a slingshot in the left side\nof the area, and the left Bumper forms the right wall of the area.  So, the\nball can often stay up among the kickers for quite a while.\n\nG Ramp This ramp is made of light yellow plastic, molded in the shape of a\n\"G\".  It's very steep, with a narrow entrance.   It's the same width all the\nway around, so it doesn't have the problem of rejecting balls that WWF's\nleft ramp had.  The plastic loops above the Left Orbit, which unfortunately\nobscures the Guitar saucer and some of the mode lights.  There are two globe\nlights above the entrance: the yellow light indicates the Ramp will feed the\nRose Plunger, and the red light indicates the Ramp will award a mode\njackpot.  When the ball is not diverted to the Rose Plunger, it is fed to\nthe Left Inlane.\n\nSnake Pit A green plastic bowl, placed above the curved part of the Left\nOrbit.  Picture the Spinout skill shot in Taxi, move it to the other side of\nthe board, and that's what the Pit looks like.  The Rose Plunger sends the\nball here.  When the ball drops out, it lands in the orbit.  The bottom of\nthe bowl is fairly flat, so a full-strength plunge can send the ball\nspinning for quite a while.\n\nRollover Lanes (J-A-M) These three lanes lead down to the Bumpers.  The\nautoplunger/Right Hole habitrail drops the ball just above the lanes.\n\nBumpers Three yellow bumpers.  The left Bumper forms the right wall of the\nCaptive Ball area.  The ball exits the bumper area down the center-left of\nthe board, and can roll anywhere between the left flipper and the left\noutlane.\n\nMini-Loop This is a loop that is hit from the Upper Flipper.  It runs past the\nright of the bumper area, then joins up with the Orbit and leads back to the\nUpper Flipper.  There is a rollover switch about 1/4 of the way up the lane,\nwhich you must hit to get credit for a shot.  Since there's only one switch\nin the loop, you can get credit for two shots if the ball is not hit\ncompletely around the loop but instead crosses the switch, stops, and rolls\nback over the switch again.\n\nCenter Scoop This is a rather large scoop that can be hit from any flipper.\nThe kickout sends the ball straight at the left flipper.  A red globe light\nabove the scoop lights when Mystery or a mode jackpot can be collected here.\n\nR Ramp This ramp is made of red plastic, in the shape of an R.  It's easier to\nhit than the G ramp; in fact, backhanding it with the right flipper is not\nhard at all.  The ball is always fed to the Right Inlane.\n\nRight Hole This is a saucer at the end of a long straight lane.  It can be hit\nfrom either lower flipper.  The ball is kicked up onto the autoplunger\nhabitrail, which feeds the Rollover Lanes.\n\nRight Orbit Balls shot up the Right Orbit will travel all the way around to\nthe left side, or fall to the Rollover Lanes if they were traveling slowly.\nDepending in the situation, you may have to shoot the entire orbit or just\nthis side to collect an award.\n\nRight Drop Targets Similar to the targets on the left side.\n\nRight Inlane This lane lights the G Ramp for a short time during normal play.\n\nRight Outlane This lane has an adjustable post (with rubber) that can be moved\nsideways.  Even if the post is all the way to the left, this outlane is\npretty wide, so practice your nudging!  Draining down this outlane during\nnormal play awards an odd-change bonus called \"Michelle.\"\n\nSlingshots & flippers Two of each, normal places.\n\nMagnets Whenever more than one ball is in play, the magnets will be active.\nThere are three magnets, which can be activated independently (like the\nmagnets in TAF).\n\nAutoplunger This is a silver gun.  The trigger is used to launch balls and\ntoggle the lock on the currently lit mode.\n\nRose Plunger This manual plunger is on the left side of the cabinet.  The ball\nis dropped here when the G Ramp is lit for Multiball start, Snake, or Super\nSnake.  Plunging sends the ball spinning in the Snake Pit.\n\nGlobe status lights There are four globe lights, one above each plunger, and\ntwo above the rules card.  The gun plunger light is red, and is lit when the\ncurrently lit mode is locked.  The Rose Plunger light is yellow, and flashes\nwhen the G Ramp will feed the ball to the plunger.  There is a white light\njust above the rules card, which is lit when the current player has one or\nmore extra balls.  Finally, a red globe near the white one flashes when the\nMagnets are active.\n\n\nPlunger Awards\nThere is no skill shot in GnR.  Instead, you can choose from 4 awards at\nthe start of each ball:\n\n\nAdd Member Spots a band member.  If you use this to spot the 6th band member,\nMultiball will start immediately, with 6 balls and the jackpots' base value\nat 50M.\n\nStart Guitar Feature Starts the currently lit mode.\n\nSuper Pops Bumpers are worth 2M per hit for the rest of the ball.\n\nMystery Value Gives a random award.  See the section on Mystery for details.\n\n\nThese awards are always the same.  Select the award you want with the\nflippers, and collect it by launching the ball.  The lit award will also slowly\ncycle to the right if you don't press a flipper.\n\nYou can launch the ball by pulling the autoplunger trigger, or holding in\nthe right flipper button and pressing the left flipper button.  If you choose\nthe second method, pressing the right flipper will change the award, but\npressing the left won't.\n\nThe Ramps\nDuring normal play, the G Ramp spots letters in \"GUNS N\" and the R Ramp\nspots letters in \"ROSES\".  Your progress is shown by lights in the GnR logo in\nthe center of the playfield.\n\nEach shot to a ramp (whether or not you've completed the associated\nletters) is worth 5M.  If the ramp was lit by the opposite Inlane, it's worth\n10M.  If you alternate the Ramps without missing, the value increases by 5M per\nhit until you miss.  So you could shoot 4 ramps and get 10M, 15M, 20M, and then\n25M.  When a ramp's timer runs out, the value drops back to 10M.\n\nWhen you light all 10 letters, a 50M hurry up stars.  Shooting either ramp\ncollects the current value of the hurry up and freezes the countdown for a few\nseconds.  The round ends when the value reaches 30M.\n\nEvery shot to a ramp adds to your end of ball bonus: 200K for each G Ramp,\nand 100K for each R Ramp shot.\n\nMystery Award\nThe Center Scoop and autoplunger can award a Mystery Value, which is\nusually something good.  Awards include: 25M, 50M, Super Kickback (unlimited\nkickback for the rest of the ball), 20x bonus, Super Pops (2M per hit for the\nrest of the ball), Mega Pops (3M per hit for the rest of the ball), extra ball,\nspecial, Multiball.\n\nLight the Center Scoop by hitting the Mini-loop.  It takes 2 loops to\nlight the Scoop the first time, then 3 loops the second time, and so on.\nChoosing Mystery Value from the autoplunger will also increase the number of\nloops needed to light the Scoop.  So, if you choose Mystery at the start of\nball 1, you'll need 3 loops to light the Scoop the first time.\n\nEach time you hit the Mini-loop, the display tells you how many more hits\nare needed to light the Scoop.\n\nR-O-C-K\nDuring normal play, completing the Left Drops spots \"R\" and \"O\", and the\nRight Drops spot \"C\" and \"K\" (that's one letter per completion).  Spotting a\nletter is worth 10M.  When you complete all four letters, a 100M hurry-up is\nlit at the Left Orbit.  The value freezes while the ball is in the Bumpers, and\ntimes out at 20M.\n\nIf a mode ends while the ROCK countdown is still lit, you cannot start\nanother mode until you collect ROCK or it times out.\n\nGuitar Modes\nGnR has 9 modes, plus the Wizard Bonus.  At the start of the game, Matt\nScoring will be lit.  Each bumper hit moves the lit mode up one (skipping over\ncompleted modes, of course).  During multiball, the lit mode does not change.\n\nA really great and useful feature is the ability to \"lock\" to currently\nlit mode.  When you lock the mode, it will not change when the Bumpers are hit.\nPulling the autoplunger trigger toggles the lit mode between locked and\nunlocked.  When the mode is locked, the red globe above the autoplunger lights.\n\nAt the start of each ball, and at the end of each mode, the currently lit\nmode is automatically unlocked.  However, if you start a mode while it was\nlocked, at the end of the mode, the globe light will remain lit even though the\nnext mode is unlocked at first.  (This has been fixed in later ROM revisions.)\nPulling the trigger while a mode is running or during multiball has no effect.\n\nIn general, only one mode can run at one time.  The exception is: if you\nhve a non-Multiball mode running and Coma is lit at the Right Hole, you can\nstart Coma during the first mode.  This not only makes both modes run\nsimultaneously, it also effectively makes the first mode a Multiball mode,\nwhich can greatly increase scoring (especially in Matt Scoring).\n\nYou can also start Multiball at the Right Hole during a one-ball mode.\nDoing this does not affect the mode, but Multiball displays and animations take\nprecedence over the mode's displays, so you'll have to rely on the playfield\nlights to know when the mode ends.\n\nAnother cool feature is the Double shot.  When you start certain modes at\nthe Guitar, shooting the Mini-loop increases the value of the mode (it isn't\nalways a true doubling of the mode's value, though).  The loop is only lit for\na few seconds.  Modes started from the autoplunger cannot be doubled.\n\nDuring count-up and hurry-up modes, the count pauses when a bumper is hit,\nand remains paused for a few seconds after.\n\n Extra Ball \n\nAwards an extra ball, NQA.  This can't be doubled.  :(\n\n Gilby Rolls \n\nA video mode.  The display shows a 3/4 overhead view of Gilby riding a\nmotorcycle down a three-lane road.  Steer the bike with the flipper buttons.\nRunning down a pedestrian is worth 5M, and passing a car is 1M. Crashing into a\ncar ends the mode.  The mode also ends if you survive long enough.  There is a\nstring of about three pedestrians at the very end of the mode.  (The sequence\nof cars and pedestrians is always the same.)\n\nThe Double shot is lit at the end of the mode.  Hitting it doubles the\npoint total.\n\nAfter the mode ends, you will probably want to lock the next mode.  The\nmode above Gilby is EB.  If you've already collected that, the next mode is the\nhigh-scoring Axl 3 Ball.  If you've collected THAT too, the next mode is Dizzy\nBall, which is a bit tougher but still has high scoring potential.\n\n Lite Coma \n\nThis doesn't immediately start a mode, it lights the Right Hole to start\nComa.\n\nComa starts as a 2 ball multiball, with a jackpot of 10M.  Each bumper hit\nadds 250K to the jackpot.  Shoot the Right Hole to collect the jackpot.\nThere's also a 20 second timer.  Hitting the Right Hole before it runs out\nlaunches another ball into play.\n\nComa ends when the timer runs out and only one ball remains in play.\n\nDouble does not light for this mode.\n\n Slash Solo \n\nThis is a count-up round.  The value starts at 20M.  Shoot either orbit\n(you only need to hit the switch in the Right Orbit) or the Mini-loop to\ncollect the current value of the count-up.  The mode ends when the count-up\nreaches 50M.\n\nShooting Double makes the count-up go from 40M to 100M.  [Note: the values\nmay differ on other ROM revisions.]\n\n Matt Scoring \n\nThis mode's jackpot starts at 10M.  Each switch scores 250K and adds 250K\nto the jackpot.  Every few switch hits increases the switch value by 250K.\nShooting the Left Orbit collects the jackpot and doubles the switch value.  The\nmode lasts 20(?) seconds.\n\nHitting Double makes the switch value start at 500K.\n\n Super Snake \n\nA 50M hurry-up is lit at the G Ramp.  Hitting the Ramp collects the\nhurry-up value and feeds the ball to the Rose Plunger.  Each spin in the Snake\nPit advances the display 1x-2x-3x.  When the ball falls out of the Pit, you are\nawarded the hurry-up value multiplied by the lit multiplier.\n\nThe mode ends when the hurry-up counts down to 15M or you collect the\npoints.\n\nHitting Double raises the hurry-up starting value to 100M.\n\n Duff Rocks \n\nYou have 30 seconds to get 10 hits on the DUFF targets in the Captive Ball\narea.  Doing so awards 100M.\n\nHitting Double raises the value to 200M.\n\n Dizzy Ball \n\nThis is a 2 ball multiball.  Each ramp hit scores 10M + 1M for each drop\ntarget hit.  Hitting a ramp also increases the value of the next ramp by 1M.\nThe ramp value has a maximum of 50M.  The mode ends when one ball drains.\n\nHitting Double raises the initial ramp value to 20M.\n\n Axl 3 Ball \n\nThis is a 3 ball multiball.  The Center Scoop awards Mini-Jackpots, worth\n10M plus 1M for each drop target hit, to a max of 30M.  The mode ends when 2\nballs drain.\n\nHitting Double raises the starting value of the jackpot to 20M.\n\n Riot (Wizard Bonus) \n\nThis is a 6-ball multiball mode.  The object is pretty simple: keep the\nballs in play as long as possible. :>\n\n\nobjectivegives youand it's worth\n40 switches       \"R\"            40 million \n60 switches       \"I\"            60 million \n80 switches       \"O\"            80 million \n120 switches      \"T\"           100 million \nMini-Loop      Riot Jackpot       1 billion!\n\n\nIn addition, hitting either ramp at any time scores 10M.\n\nAfter collecting the Riot Jackpot, it starts over.  You need more switches\nfor each letter (I think the second \"R\" needs 140) and the letter value\nincreases by 20M each time, with no maximum.\n\nEach time you reach an objective, a ball is autoplunged (unless there are\nalready 6 balls in play).  The mode ends when only one ball remains in play.\nMatt Scoring will be lit after Riot ends.\n\nMultiball\nTo light Multiball, hit the Right Hole to add band members to the stage.\nEach hit is worth 10M and adds one member.  When you get 5 members on the\nstage, you have a choice.  Shooting the Right Hole again will start a 6-ball\nMultiball with the jackpots starting at 50M.  Shooting the G Ramp will send the\nball to the Rose Plunger.  Each spin in the Snake Pit advances the display\n35M-65M-35M-65M-35M.  The lit value when the ball falls out will be the base\nvalue of jackpots.  4 balls are then autoplunged.\n\nHitting a Ramp collects a jackpot and unlights the ramp.  After you hit\nboth ramps, the Right Hole is lit for a 100M jackpot.  After you collect the\n100M, another ball is launched and both ramps relight for jackpots.  Hitting\nboth ramps again lights the Right Hole for 100M.  Once you collect the second\n100M jackpot, another ball is launched and the Mini-loop is lit for the Super\nJackpot, which starts at 250M and increases 1M for each bumper hit.\n\nWhile the regular jackpots are lit, each switch adds 200K to the jackpot\nvalues.\n\nIf you drain all but one ball without hitting either Ramp, you can restart\nMultiball by hitting the G Ramp or the Right Hole.  Jackpots are reset to their\nbase value when Multiball is restarted.\n\nFor the first two Multiballs, the band members you collect are saved\nbetween balls.  But starting with the third Multiball, you must collect all 6\non the same ball.\n\nIf, at the start of ball 3, you haven't started Multiball, it will be lit\nfor you.  However, the number of balls you will have and the base value of\njackpots depends on how many band members you lit during balls 1 and 2.\n\nAt the start of ball 3, both Multiball start shots will be lit.  The Right\nHole will still add a band member before starting Multiball.\n\nHere's a list of info regarding multiball when it's lit for you:\n\n\n# members# ballsRight Hole jackpot valueG Ramp jackpot values\n    0         2          n/a           10M/40M \n    1         2          25M           15M/45M \n    2         2          30M           20M/50M \n    3         3          35M           25M/55M \n    4         4          40M           30M/60M \n    5         5          45M           35M/65M \n    6         6          50M             n/a   \n\n\nOther Scoring and Miscellaneous Stuff\n\nKickback The Kickback is lit at the start of each ball.  Relight it by\nshooting the Mini-Loop or both banks of Drop Targets.\n\nBall Saver The ball saver is active at the start of each ball, but there is no\nlight to tell you that it's on.  It is also active at the start of a\nmultiball mode or Multiball itself.  You will also be saved if you lose the\nlast 2 balls of a multiball round at the same time: the round will end but\none ball will be saved (this is a nice new twist to ball savers).\n\nMultiball note Multiball and multiball modes end as soon as the next to last\nball lands in the outhole.  There is never a grace period.\n\nAxl Combo During normal play, shooting the entire Right Orbit and then the\nCenter Scoop awards the Axl Combo, which is worth 5M plus 1M for each shot\nto the unlit Scoop during that ball, to a max of 30M.  On some machines, you\ncan score this by holding up the upper flipper when the ball is shot quickly\naround the Orbit.\n\nMichelle This bonus seems to depend on how long you've kept the ball in play.\nI once got a Michelle bonus of 51M after a particularly successful Riot\nBall!\n\nSNAKE During normal play, shooting the entire Right Orbit adds a letter in\nS-N-A-K-E (and spots one of the JAM lanes).  Completing SNAKE lights the G\nRamp to feed the Rose Plunger.  Once you load the Plunger, four awards will\nbe displayed.  Launch the ball to collect one of the awards.  Awards\ninclude: 25M, 50M, Bonus 20x, Add Band Member, Super Kickback, and maybe\nothers.\n\nFun With Bonus (1M + 200K for each G Ramp hit during that ball + 100K for each\nR Ramp hit during that ball + 1M for each Guitar mode played during the\ngame) * bonus multiplier.\n\nBonus Multipliers Completing JAM advances the bonus multiplier from 1x to 2,\n4, 6, 8, and 10x.  After reaching 10x, completing JAM awards 20M per\ncompletion.  Collecting a JAM 20x award also makes JAM worth 20M per\ncompletion.\n\nBumper scoring If you don't collect a Super/Mega Pops award, the bumpers start\neach ball at 100K per hit.  Every ten bumper hits raises the value by 100K,\nto a max of 1M.  Once the value reaches 1M (or when you collect a Super/Mega\nPops award), the bumper value cannot be increased.\n\nMatch sequence The animation shows a woman pulling her shirt off over her\nhead.  The picture then scrolls down, and she's covering herself with a big\ncard (on which is displayed the match number).  If you don't match, you get\nthe very neat quote, \"aww, dude!\"  If you do match, WAIT!!!  You should know\nby now that you have to wait until the match animation finishes before the\ncredit is actually awarded.  This delay seems very long, compared to other\nrecent DE pins.\n\nThere is an option in the menus called \"Modesty Option.\"  Switching\nthis OFF changes the match animation.  The girl still pulls her shirt off,\nbut when the picture scrolls down, she's not covering herself, and one match\ndigit appears on each breast.\n\nEB Buy-in You can buy one ball at the end of ball 3.  You don't get any extra\nawards when you buy a ball.  BUT--you must press the EB button sometime\n*during* the game in order to get the option of buying-in.  Once, I finished\nwith 4.2B but since I forgot to hit that button during the game, no buy in!\nD'oh!  Moral: hit that EB button as soon as the first ball is served to the\nplunger.\n\nDuff Jackpot During normal play, completing the DUFF targets awards a jackpot,\nwhich is worth between 20M and 100M.  When the captive ball hits a DUFF\ntarget, a special display is shown on the DMD.  While this display is up,\neach hit to the bumper adds 1M to the jackpot.  This jackpot carries over\nbetween players and games.\n\n\nStrategies\n Getting extra balls \n\nThe ability to lock the mode pretty much guarantees you one extra ball.\nIf you do not choose Start Guitar Mode when you start a ball, check the mode\nlights and make note of how many bumper hits it will take to get the lit mode\nto EB.  Listen to the bumpers, and lock the mode after the right number of\nhits.\n\nIf you lock EB but don't collect it before draining, just select Start\nGuitar at the beginning of the next ball to collect it.\n\nIf Gilby Rolls is the lit mode, catch the ball on the lower left flipper.\nFrom that flipper you have a clear shot at the center bumper.  Shoot that\nbumper and lock the mode (which will change to EB) immediately.\n\n Backhanding \n\nGnR has three shots that are perfect for backhands: the Guitar Saucer, the\nR Ramp, and the Right Hole.\n\nThe Guitar Saucer is the hardest of the three to hit, but it's worth doing\nif your Saucer tends to reject quick shots from the right flipper.  You need to\nflip very early, almost as if you were doing a slingshot post pass.  The ball\nshould hit the right side of the metal lane and be guided into the saucer.\n\nThe R Ramp can be worth tons of points if you can consistently backhand\nit, especially during Dizzy Ball and the Ramp hurry-up round.  Since the R Ramp\nfeeds back to the right flipper (for another backhand shot), you can collect\nmany awards with little effort. :>\n\nThe Right Hole is nearly always a good target.  If there's a mode running,\nor if EB is the lit mode, then those are better shots, but otherwise I hit the\nRight Hole whenever I can.  Where backhanding comes into play is in how easy\nthe shot seems (to me at least) from the right flipper.  It seems much easier,\nand if you miss, the ball will be moving slower and will be easier to control.\n\n Mode Choices \n\nMy usual strategy is to choose Start Guitar every time.  Adding band\nmembers is easy to do during play, and if you're consistent on hitting the\nMini-Loop, you'll have Mystery lit in no time.\n\nAfter Matt Scoring finishes (that's always the first mode) of course go\nfor the EB.  If Gilby Rolls is the lit mode and you have the ball caught, go\nahead and play Gilby, and as soon as the ball is kicked back into play, lock\nthe EB mode.\n\nAfter getting the EB, I don't really have a preferred choice of modes.  If\nyou have been hitting the Orbits well that game, you should go for Slash Solo.\nIf the captive ball area seems bouncy, go for Duff Rocks.  If you can hit the\nRamps consistently, go for Dizzy Ball.  (Do you see a pattern here?)\n\nBasically, any mode can be worth a lot, but take the modes whose shots\nyou're good at first.  If you're just having an overall bad day, there's always\nthe video mode, which is worth about 65M (or 130M doubled).\n\n Riot Ball \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago I made a change in the way I play Multiball rounds that\nhave more than three balls, and I think it's helped me a lot.  In my normal\nplaying stance, the center of my palms rest on the corners of the lockdown bar,\nand my middle fingers rest on the flipper buttons.  I have my left foot placed\nforward of my right one, and I'm bent over a bit at the waist.  I found that I\ncouldn't react quickly enough when several balls were near the flippers.\n\nSo, the change I made was to stand more upright, feet together, and take\nmy hands off the lockdown bar.  The only place I was in contact with the\ncabinet was the tips of my middle fingers, which rested on the flipper buttons.\n\nThis new stance made it easier to flail at balls when I needed to, and\nalthough my accuracy suffers (since I'm not comfortable playing upright),\naccuracy isn't that necessary in Riot Ball.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Guns 'n' Roses", "manufacturer": "Data East", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/gunsnroses.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Guns 'n' Roses", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

For it's\ntime period,\nit is a throwback to the old days. There are\ngates that\ncan be lifted to allow loops past the top\nlanes, but\nthere are no ramps of any kind on the table.\nThis is\na good bar pinball, that doesnt' require much\nmaintenance.\nJust the thing for a real harley rider to\nstep up and play. The flippers don't need much power to\nplay the game well.\n\nHow to score points.\n\nCompleting U-S-A lanes (red, white, and blue,\nwith single\ndirection lane change) advances bonus X, which\ngoes up\nto 6x, and is never reset on factory\ndifficulty. Clearing\nthe lanes at 6x lights outlane extra ball.\nThereafter,\ncompleting USA gives you a USA bonus that\nstarts at 100k,\nand increases by 100k each time it is\ncollected, without\nlimit, as near as I can tell. If there is a\nlot of good\nbumper action, getting a replay off of the\nUSA bonuses\nis not out of the question.\n\nThere are two sets of drop targets. one bank\nin te center,\n(L-E-Y) and one on the far left (H-A-R)\ncompleting HAR\nlights the left spinner for 3k/spin, and\ncompleting\nLEY lights the right. Completing both scores\nand advances\nthe HARLEY bonus (50k 100k, 200k, 300k\n500k)\n\nThen there are the DAVIDSON standups. D is on\nthe very\nleft below the drops, A is between the left\norbit and\nleft eject, V is in the same spot on the\nright, and\nthe rest are along the right wall. Completing\nDAVIDSON\nlights the speed bonus at the right eject, a\nhurryup\nthat starts at 1 million, and increases by 1\nmillion\neach time collected. Completing DAVIDSON\ntwice on one\nball lights the extra ball at the right\neject. Jackpot\nis also lit here, when you travel across\nAmerica.\n\nThe left eject is lit for 25k at start of\ngame. HItting\nthis eject scores and advances the eject hole\nvalue\n(10k,25k,50k,100k,150k+lock) Upon locking a\nball, right\neject lights for lock. Hitting right eject\nwhen lit\nfor lock starts multiball. During multiball,\ncompleting\nHARLEY *and* DAVIDSON scores 5 million, and\nlights the\norbit shots for 1 million each for the rest\nof multiball.\nThe jackpot is NOT related to multiball.\nAfter your\nfirst multiball, the eject hole resets to 10k\n(no lights)\n\nThere is a third eject on the field, this one\nis below\nthe IDSON standups, and is impossible to\nshoot directly.\nA ball can only bounce in by accident. This\nawards Speed\ntrap (\"He's gettin away!\", provided it didnt'\nland in\nfrom a weak plunge, a random mystery value.\nThis can\nbe a score bonus, bonus advance, lighting the\nspeed\nbonus, loosing a tilt warning (\"Lemme see\nyour license..\nhey, that's a nice bike. now go on. Git!\") a\ntraffic\nticket (-10k!) or advance city i think. Speed\nbonus,\ntraffic ticker, and tilt warning seem to be\nmost common.\nNote that it will ALWAYS award instant\nmultiball if\na ball is locked. Locked balls can be stolen\nin this\ngame. Speed trap is usually awarded only once\nper ball,\nbut there is a way to relight the speed trap.\nI'm not\nsure what it is, though.\n\nLike Fathom, the inlanes are where the\noutlanes should\nbe, and vice versa. The inlanes and outlanes\nspell B\nI K E. Lighting BIKE (lane change works here\ntoo) spots\na city (\"Harley spotted in\n<cityname>\"), and scores\nthe BIKE bonus (50k). B and I light the right\norbit,\nand K or E lights the left. Hitting a LIT\norbit lets\nthe ball go all the way around the loop, and\nawards\na city+50k, just like spelling BIKE. It also\nlights\nthe orbit you just shot for one million (\"One\nMillion....\").\nShooting an unlit orbit feeds the jets, and\nlights that\norbit. Lit orbits and millions time out after\n10 or\n15 seconds or so. A ball that goes up a LIT\norbit and\ntrickles back down usually awards two cities,\ndepending\non speed (one for the return trip) A ball\nthat goes\nup and down an unlit orbit will award one.\nThus weak\nflippers don't hurt you too much. A clean\nshot when\nboth orbits are lit will score two cities,\nand light\nboth orbits for million.\n\nLighting all cities lights jackpot (\"Harley\nspotted\nin Laconia, heading for jackpot\"). Jackpot\nhas a minimum\nof 5 million, and is progressively increased\nby the\njet bumpers. Subsequent jackpots are\nmultiplied. Thus\nyou second jackpot is a double jackpot, your\nthird is\na triple jackpot, etc. Jackpots are probably\nthe best\nway to score points. Not to mention the\nmillion point\nshots you'll pick up from loops, and the USA\nbonuses\nyou'll pick up from the USA lanes.\n\nHitting an unlit eject hole (other than the\nleft one)\ngives you a rest stop bonus, which starts at\n30k or\nso and goes up 5k each time. Not very\nworthwhile, unlike\nthe USA bonus.\n\nThere are three basic strategies. Advance\ncities, and\ncollect jackpots. Spell harley and davidson\nand score\nharley bonuses and Speed values. Or play\nmultiball.\nMultiball is difficult, but can be very\nlucrative, and\nyou can still get cities during multiball. you cannot\ncollect harley and speed bonuses, though. Still it's\nworthwhile to learn both eject shots. Even if you hate\nmultiball, you need to shoot the right one to collect\nspeed bonuses and jackpots, as well as the odd Extra\nball, and the two are mirror images of each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Harley Davidson", "possible_shots": "U-S-A lanes, two sets of drop targets (L-E-Y and H-A-R), DAVIDSON standups, left eject, right eject for lock and multiball, third eject for Speed trap, inlanes and outlanes spell B I K E, lit and unlit orbits, unlit eject hole for rest stop bonus", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/harleydavidson-bally.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Harley Davidson", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Freely distributable.\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\"High Speed\" is a pinball game by the fabulous Mr. Steve Ritchie, and\nis dated February 1986 (according to the manual).  It is a fast-paced,\nhigh-testosterone game, with pretty lights and shiny chrome rails.  I\nmet mine in June of 1986 and it sparked the beginning of my descent into\nthe fascinating world of pinball.  High Speed turned out to be a very\npopular game, based on the estimated run of over 13,000 units.  \"Hot\nAction Pinball\", indeed!!!  The game credits are as follows:\n\n\n Design and Concept: Steve Ritchie\n Software: L.E.D.\n Sounds: Bill Parod, SSR, and Eugene Jarvis\n Graphic Design by Mark Sprenger\n\n\nSteve Ritchie is known for numerous pinball machines, such as:  Airborne\nAvenger, Superman, Flash, Stellar Wars, Firepower, Black Knight, Hyperball,\nHigh Speed, F-14 Tomcat, Black Knight 2000, Rollergames, Terminator 2,\nHigh Speed 2: The Getaway, Star Trek: The Next Generation and finally,\nNo Fear.\n\nSteve Ritchie took a break from pinball in 1995/1996 and is (at the\ntime of this writing), working on video games somewhere in California.\nWe most certainly anticipate his return in the (hopefully) not too\ndistant future.\n\nQUICK REFERENCE CARD (straight off the game)\nHigh Speed\n\n\n Make Stoplight Targets to change Ramp Stoplight from Green to Yellow to Red.\n Eject Hole and Ramp spot Stoplight Lamp.\n Shoot Ball up Ramp to run Red Stoplight, starting Police Chase.\n Shoot Ball up Ramp DURING Police Chase to Escape from Police and Begin\n*Multi-Ball* Play.\n Shoot Ball up Ramp DURING *Multi-Ball* Play to WIN Hideout Jackpot.\n\n\n\n Flipper return lanes light timed Freeway Arrow.\n Shooting up Lit Freeway scores and advances  Freeway value toward Extra Ball.\n Each ball: 1st Freeway Shot lights Flipper Lanes; 2nd lights Spinners; 3rd\nlights Hold Bonus.\n Flashing 1-6 Targets Advances Ramp value and lights Kickback.\n\n\nMAXIMUM CREDITS - 30\n\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\nAdvance the traffic light to red, run the red light and get away at\nHigh Speed!  Once you have gotten away, during Multi-Ball, hide in the\nhideout for the bonus jackpot!\n\nSTARTING THE GAME\nOne to four players can play.  Traditional High Speed games support\nthe 1-game, 3-balls per quarter (Factory Settings).  50 cent High Speed\ngames will not display half-credits.  New players can enter the game by\ninserting coins and pressing Start until the end of the first ball; after\nthat, pressing Start aborts the current game for all players and begins\na new one.\nPLUNGER SKILL SHOT\nHigh Speed does not truly have a plunger skill shot.  While it is\npossible to shoot a ball up the ramp and have it slide down the guide\nrails into a hideout, but no extra points are awarded for such a feat.\nDepending upon the difficulty level, the game will spot a stoplight\nfor you for just making it up the ramp off the plunger (see STOPLIGHTS\nand RAMP SHOTS).\n\nAnother possible skill shot would be to hit a flashing stoplight target\nopposite or above the opening of the plunger slot.  No special points are\nawarded, but it gets you out of hitting the target later.  Use this only\nif you don't get a free stoplight for a plunger ramp shot.\nSTOPLIGHTS\nThe main stoplight is located above the opening to the ramp.  You\nbegin with a green light.  Around the board are three sets of stoplights\nlights with red, yellow and green targets.  The game begin with a green\nlight.  Each light begins with its light flashing on each of the three\nstoplight targets.  Complete each light by spotting each flashing target\nby hitting it with the ball, or using the ramp (see RAMP SHOTS) or the\neject hole (see EJECT HOLE).  When the all targets of the current light\nhave been spotted, the light is advanced to yellow, then to red.  When\nyou reach the red light.  You must now send the ball up the ramp to begin\nthe police chase.  This can either be done from the playfield or off of\nthe plunger.  During the police chase, spot all nine stoplight targets\nin any order to light the \"Escape\" lamp at the eject hole.  During\nMulti-Ball and *after* scoring a jackpot, all nine target lights may\nagain be spotted in any order to light the Extra Ball.  Ramp shots and\nthe eject hole will not help you here.  Whenever a stoplight is spotted,\nthe game adds 1,000 points to your bonus total (see BONUS POINTS).\n\nThe three traffic lights around the board can be hit/marked in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n\n    Hitting the target next to the light with the ball.\n    Sending the ball up the ramp (see RAMP SHOTS).  Depending\nupon the difficulty setting, you may or may not be awarded\na stoplight target for a plunger ramp shot.  3-ball settings\ntypically do, 5-ball settings typically don't.\n    Landing the ball in the eject hole (see EJECT HOLE).  Again,\ndepending upon the difficulty setting, this feature may be\ndisabled.  3-ball settings typically do, 5-ball settings\ntypically don't.\n\n\nIf the game has a choice, it will always spot the lower bank\ntargets first, then the upper bank targets, and finally the center\nbank targets.  If more than one target is valid on a bank, the game\nwill spot the red first, yellow second and green last.\nRAMP SHOTS\nDuring normal gameplay, when a ball is sent up the ramp, the game\nwill push the ball down one of the guide rails and into one of the side\nhide-outs.  You are also awarded the Ramp Bonus, plus a Bonus Multipler.\nRamp Bonus can be 50,000 to 250,000 points, in 25,000 point increments\n(increased by the 1-6 Targets).  The Bonus Multipler can be 2X thru 5X.\n\nEach ramp shot will also spot a stoplight target and advance the\ncurrent light, if necessary.  Depending upon the difficulty setting,\nthe game may or may not spot a stoplight for a plunger ramp shot.  The\nramp value and bonus multiplier are not awarded for a plunger ramp shot.\n\nIf the main traffic light is red, you will be awarded the usual\nrewards but it will start the \"Police Chase\".  This mode is entered\nwhether the ramp shot is from the playfield or the plunger.  A shot\nto start Police Chase does not divert the ball into a hideout, and\ninstead exits at the right-end of the ramp, dropping back onto the\nplayfield, just above the upper-right flipper.\n\nSending a ball up the ramp during the \"Police Chase\" constitutes a\n\"Getaway\" and will lock the ball in one of the hideouts.  A second ball\nwill be served up which will be locked in the other hideout.  A third\nball will be served which when it registers anywhere on the playfield,\nwill release the other two balls, beginning Multi-Ball play.  In the\nevent you miss the ramp on the second ball, the game will abort to\ntwo-ball multiball by ejecting the other locked ball.  However, if you\nhaven't touched anything, some games will allow you to drain the ball\nand try again.  Others will drain the ball eject the locked ball,\nstarting you over at a green light.\n\n\"Escape\" is pretty much the same thing, except that the first ball\nis locked in the Eject Hole saucer, and the other two in the hideouts.\nMulti-Ball starts, but the ball locked in the Eject Hole is released\nlast.  :-(\n\nDuring Multi-Ball play, sending a ball up the ramp will lock it in a\nhideout and will award a jackpot bonus (see JACKPOT BONUS).  Sending a\nsecond ball up will lock it in the other hideout and but only awards a\nstandard ramp bonus.  Sending a third ball up awards a standard ramp\nbonus and kicks out one of the other balls, and locks the one you just\nshot up the ramp.  When the last playfield ball is drained, all locked\nballs are released and play continues.  If you have more than one ball\nlocked, you continue Multi-Ball play.  When you are down to one ball,\nyou start over at a green light.\nEJECT HOLE\nAbove the upper right-hand flipper, there is an eject hole.  During\nnormal play, landing a ball there will temporarily lock the ball.  The game\nmay also award you by marking off a light target, depending upon the\ndifficulty setting.  The biggest advantage is the ball is kicked out to\nthe lane where the upper right-hand flipper is located.  This makes for an\neasy ramp shot (if you are skilled enough and have a decently powered\nupper-flipper).\n\nDuring \"Police Chase\" mode or Multi-Ball, the eject hole will mark off\nan unmarked target for you.  If all targets are marked, the ball lock will\nconstitute an \"Escape\".\n\nIf lit, the eject hole will award an \"Extra Ball\".\nTHE FREEWAY\nThere are two freeways and three freeway spinners.  Two are on the outer\nlanes around the upper half of the board, the third leads to the eject hole.\nThe two outer lanes award the Freeway Bonus, when its Freeway Arrow is lit.\nFreeway scoring is as follows:\n\n\n  When nothing is lit: 100 points for each time the freeway signs\n(spinners) spin when hit by the ball.\n  When nothing is lit, riding both outer-lane freeways in succession\n(ie: one big loop) will light the timed Freeway Arrow on the side\nyou entered first.  If you're good at making this loop, it's a great\nway to pick up points and bonuses (ie: Hold Bonus, Light Extra Ball).\n  The lower flipper inlanes will light the opposite-side timed\nFreeway Arrow.\n  The lower flipper inlanes, when lit, will also award 20,000 points\nand will re-light the Kickback, if necessary.\n  When the Freeway Arrows are flashing, the freeway awards:\n\n  50,000 points and lights the flipper inlanes.\n  75,000 points and lights the spinners.\n  100,000 points and lights Hold Bonus.\n  100,000 points and lights Extra Ball.\n\nThe above is for 3-ball games.  5-ball games start you at 25,000\npoints.  All other awards are the same, except that Light Extra\nBall shows up on the fifth run.\n  When the spinners are lit, they award 1,000 points per spin when\nhit by the ball (plus a really cool sound).\n\n\nThe Freeway Bonus indicators only flash for a short period of time.  They\ngo out when the time has elapsed or the Freeway Bonus is collected.  The\n20,000 bonus/light kickback and 1000 point indicators will last till the\nend of the ball.  The Extra Ball lamp will last until collected on 3-ball\ngames, or till the end of the ball on 5-ball games.\nTHE SIDE 1-2-3 AND 4-5-6 TARGETS\nOne of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 targets will be flashing at all times.\nHitting the target will advance the Ramp value and will re-light the\nKickback light, if necessary.  These targets score 20,000 points when\nflashing, or 1,000 points when unlit.\nBONUS POINTS\nVarious targets will award bonus points and your total is kept tallied\non the main playfield (designed to look like a tachometer).  You start each\nball with 1,000 bonus points.  Each stoplight adds 1,000 points to your\nbonus total.  The outlanes add 3,000 bonus points to your bonus total.  At\nthe end of each ball, the game awards you these bonus points, multiplied by\nyour bonus multiplier (you start at 1X, advance using the ramp, see RAMP\nSHOTS).  The game will start you over at 1,000 bonus points unless Hold\nBonus has been awarded (see THE FREEWAY).  If you have finished your last\nball with a Hold Bonus, the game holds both your bonus points, as well as\nyour bonus multiplier, otherwise, bonus multipliers are not carried over\nfrom ball to ball.\nJACKPOT BONUS\nThe jackpot bonus starts at 250,000 points and climbs from game to\ngame.  Every point earned in Multi-Ball, *before* scoring the jackpot,\nis added to the jackpot bonus.  Once awarded, the jackpot bonus resets\nitself to 250,000 points (kinda like the lottery), but does not begin\nto accumulate more Multi-Ball points until the *next* Multi-Ball.  The\nmaximum Jackpot value is 2,000,000 points.\nOUTLANES\nThere are two special lights, one for each outlane.  When lit, they\nwill award 1 credit.  When only one is lit, the slingshots/bumpers move\nthe light from one side to the other.  You light the outlanes by making\nit to the red light (you don't need to run it) twice in a 3-ball game,\nor three times in a 5-ball game.\n\nWhen the special light is not lit, the outlanes will add 3,000 points\nto your bonus total.\nSTRATEGY\nGet good at the freeway shots, the ramp shot and the eject hole shot.\nThe freeway shots are probably easiest and if you can collect the Freeway\nBonuses often enough, this strategy easily outruns multiple ramp shots,\nplus you get bonuses like Hold Bonus and Light Extra Ball.  The ramp shot\nis best to spot a hard-to-reach stoplight.  The ramp bonus isn't bad either\nand bonus multipliers are always a good thing to have.  The eject hole is\nreally only worth it on games that will spot a stoplight for you.  All games\nwill spot stoplights from the eject hole when all stoplights are off and\ncan be hit in any order.  Also, if a playfield ramp shot cannot be made for\none reason or another, the eject hole is your only hope of getting away\n(starting Multi-Ball).\nMISCELLANEOUS INFO:\nPLAYFIELD\nThe spinners/freeways are labeled as follows:\n\n\n    Left Spinner:  Bayshore Freeway\n    Right Spinner: Santa Monica Freeway\n    Eject Spinner: San Diego Freeway\n\n\nSCORING\nHigh Speed target scoring is as follows (summary):\n\n\n    Slingshots:       10 points.\n    Spinner:         100 points per spin.\n    Lit Spinner:    1000 points per spin.\n    Bumpers:         500 points\n    Freeway Scores:\n\n  1/ 25,000;\n  2/ 50,000;\n  3/ 75,000;\n  4/100,000;\n  5/Light Extra Ball\n\n    Ramp:\n\n  1/ 50,000;\n  2/ 75,000;\n  3/100,000\n\n\nBONUS TOTAL SCORING\n\n    Plunger (starting): 1,000 points\n    Stoplight Target:   1,000 points\n    Outlanes:           3,000 points\n\nTRIVIA (from the Steve Ritchie IRC chat):\nHigh Speed was based on the true story of Steve Ritchie being chased\nby the cops, while doing 146mph in his 1979 Porsche 928.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "High Speed", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronics, Inc.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/highspeed.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: High Speed", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I retain any and all rights\nto this guide.  You may take this guide and redistribute it and/or make\nchanges to it as long as it remains freely distributable and this policy is\nstated at the beginning of it.  No charge may be made for the distribution\nof this guide and no one may make a profit from it.  Send comments/updates/\nsuggestions/corrections to me.\n\nHurricane is probably a registered trademark of Williams Electronics, etc.\netc.  So there.\nImportant Things\nThis section describes key elements and/or shots to be made in Hurricane.\nThey will be constantly referred to in the play discussion.\n\n\nHurricane  This is the main ramp in the game.  The entrance is on the right\nside of the field, and the ball goes around the back, down the left,\naround the front of the field, and finally into the left return lane.\nNote the ball also enters the Hurricane ramp (though no credit is given\nfor hitting the Hurricane) via the plunger shot and the Ferris Wheel.\nComet  The ramp right in the middle of the field.  It can easily be shot\nfrom either flipper, and the ball is returned to the right return lane.\nFerris Wheel  The entrance to the Ferris Wheel is the furthermost left lane\ntowards the back of the field.  The ball goes on the first wheel, then\nthe second, then onto the Hurricane ramp to the left flipper.\nDummy  This is the bull's eye target in between the Hurricane and Comet\nramps.\nJuggler  The big blue box in the middle of the back of the field.  Shoot it\nup the lane between the Comet and the Ferris Wheel lane.  Usually much\neasier to backhand it with the left flipper than to \"normally\" shoot it\nwith the right.\nCats  The 4 stand-up targets with green lights on the right side of the\nplayfield, below the Hurricane shot.\nDucks  The 3 drop targets on the left side of the field.\nBumpers  The 3 pop bumpers hit when the ball comes out of the Juggler.\nPalace  Letters earned by hitting the skill shot or by Hurricane millions\nor by hitting the Hurricane shortly after completing the Ducks or Cats.\nLighting PALACE lights the jackpot.\nJackpot  Starts at 5M, maxes out between 15M - 16M.  Shoot the Juggler to\nget the Jackpot when lit.\nClown's Face  There are 6 different things to hit to light up the Clown's\nFace.  Hitting all 6 lights Clown Time.\nClown Time  When lit, hit the Hurricane to start Clown Time.  This is a\nfrenzy-type scoring time for 25 seconds, where all targets are worth\n50K.  MAJOR shots (i.e. Hurricane, Comet, Ferris Wheel) score 500K for\nthe first one, 750K for the second one, and 1M for each one thereafter.\nQuick Score  Given for shooting the ball into the Ferris Wheel directly\nafter the ball goes over the switch in the right return lane.\nMystery  When this is lit, shoot the Juggler for a \"random\" mystery score.\nBall Locks  When these are lit, shoot the Juggler to lock a ball.\nMultiball  After 2 balls are locked, launching the 3rd ball starts\nMultiball.  Hurricane is worth 1M, 2M, and 5M in order, then starts over.\nSkill Shot  After launching the ball around the Hurricane, shoot the ball\nback up the Hurricane ramp to get a Palace letter and the skill shot\nvalue (which is 500K and goes up 500K each time you make it up to 2M).\nSpecial  Awarded by hitting the Hurricane when it's lit.  Lit by Mystery\nScore or by starting your 3rd Multiball.\nStatus Report  Hold down a flipper to get some neat information.  After a\ncouple of seconds, it will tell you how many extra balls you have,\ncredits, replay score, bonus x's, # of ramps for Hurricane millions, # of\nmultiballs that special is lit on (is it ever different from 3?), and the\nhigh scores.  While holding one flipper, you can hit the other one to\nspeed through the report, just like every other WMS/BLY game since about\nWhirlwind (and, for some reason, except CFTBL).\n\nWhat Lights What\nThe Hurricane, Comet, Mystery Score, and Ferris Wheel are all lit at the\nbeginning of the game.  Furthermore, the Comet is relit at the start of each\nball.\n\nHitting the Hurricane during normal play awards 200K, 225K, unlimited\nmillions.  This is a timed shot, so if you miss it, you still have a chance\nto get it back up there for the next value.  After you get the first\nmillion, the Hurricane is lit for 1M AND a Palace letter.  So no more than 7\nHurricane millions will light the Jackpot for you.  After you finally miss a\nmillion shot, and the Hurricane times out, it will stay unlit until you hit\nall of the cats.  After you relight the Hurricane, it will take one more\nramp than last time to light the million shot.  So the second series of\nshots will go 200K, 225K, 250K, millions.  The number of ramps need for the\nmillion is kept in the Status Report.\n\nIf you perfect the Comet, you can easily score millions of points.  The\nComet starts the game lit at 100K.  The next 2 shots are scored 200K then\n300K.  These are timed shots, like the Hurricane.  Every shot after the 300K\nresults in 1M points.  However, the Comet unlimited millions is not only a\ntimed shot, but an accuracy shot.  If you touch anything other than the\nComet or the right return lane switch, AFTER getting your first million,\nthen the million shot is turned off.  And if you don't shoot it for awhile,\nit'll time out like the rest of the shots.  If you don't get the million,\nthe Comet will reset to 100K.  After you've gotten just a single million,\nwhenever the ramp resets, it'll start at 50K, making it one shot harder to\nget a million.  After a million is scored, and eventually you miss or it\ntimes out, it'll stay unlit like the Hurricane until you hit the Ferris\nWheel.  If you lose the ball, though, it resets the Comet for you.\n\nThe Ferris Wheel scores the Ferris Wheel Bonus when it is lit.  The bonus is\nlit by hitting all 3 ducks and at the start of the game.  Base value is\n250K, but that increases by 15K every time you hit a bumper or a duck.  The\nmaximum value the Ferris Wheel can get to is 1M.  Scoring the bonus turns it\noff until the ducks are hit again.  The base Ferris Wheel value does not go\nup if it isn't lit.\n\nAlso on the Ferris Wheel lane is the Quick Score.  If you hit the Ferris\nWheel directly after the ball goes down the right return lane, you score the\nQuick Score.  It starts at 250K and goes up 100K every time you get it.  I\nbelieve the maximum is 750K.  You can get the Quick Score even if the Ferris\nWheel isn't lit.\n\nAfter shooting the Ferris Wheel, as the ball goes down the left return lane,\nit will light the Dummy shot.  The Dummy stays lit for around 20 seconds.\nIf you hit him, you advance your bonus multiplier.  If you get your bonus\nmultiplier up to the blinking value (usually 3x for the first time), you\nlight the return/out lane extra ball.  If the Dummy is unlit, shooting it\nwill light it for the same 20 seconds.\n\nBoth the cats and ducks serve multi-purposes.  The cats, in addition to\nlighting the Hurricane, will light the Juggler Mystery Score.  The ducks\nlight the Juggler Ball Locks for Multiball.  For the first Multiball,\nhitting the ducks will light BOTH ball locks for you.  After that, you must\nhit the ducks once for each ball to lock, though you don't have to lock a\nball before lighting the next lock.\n\nAs previously stated, the Clown's Face has 6 different targets to hit.  They\nare:\n\n Left eye - the Ferris Wheel.\n Right eye - the Hurricane.\n Nose - the Dummy.\n Left cheek - the Ducks.\n Right cheek - the Cats.\n The mouth - the 300K shot of the Comet.\n\nWhen all 6 are hit, the face starts blinking, and the next shot up the\nHurricane starts Clown Time.\n\nClown Time and the Palace Jackpot are kept between players and between\ngames.  That is, if you had PALA lit one game, if you started another game\nright after that, PALA would still be lit.  So sometimes you get lucky and\nstart a game where PALAC is lit and the Jackpot is worth like 15.5M.  If one\nplayer lights Palace, then that person has 30 seconds to shoot the Juggler\nto get the Jackpot.  If he/she misses, then Palace reverts back to PAL and\nthe Jackpot stays the same.\n\nThe real kicker about Clown Time is that if one person goes and hits all 6\ntargets then loses the ball, then the next player need only shoot the\nHurricane, and HE gets Clown Time.  Whatever was lit on the face at the end\nof a game carries over to the next game.  The only exception is if the whole\nface was lit, but no one got Clown Time.  The next game, the face is lit\nexcept for the nose (the Dummy shot).\nMisc. Scoring\nThe Cats are worth 100K the first time you hit all 4 of them, and the value\nincreases by 100K each hit up to 1M.  The ducks score no big amount of\npoints.\n\nHitting the dummy after maxing out bonus (6x) scores 1M.  BTW - the maximum\nbonus for any one ball is 500K x 6 (3M).  Kinda bwee if you ask me.  (Can\nyou imagine a BoP with a bonus cap?  No more 11.9M bonuses!)\n\nHitting either ramp increases the Jackpot by 130K.  It starts at 5M.  If\nthe total hits 16M or more, it \"wraps-around\" to 15M again.  For example, if\nthe jackpot is at 15,900,000, the next ramp puts the jackpot at 15,030,000.\n\nIf you get more than one Clown Time in the same ball, the Clown Time score\nyou had before is put up and you keep adding to the total.  Major shot\nscores continue where you left off.  I.e., you don't need to hit the 500K -\n750K shots first this time...  All shots will be worth 1M.  The best Clown\nTime total I've had is about 25.75M, which was 3 really good Clown Times on\nthe same ball.  The game keeps track of the best Clown Time (resets as often\nas high scores 1-4) for a single ball.  There's no award for getting the\nbest Clown Time (i.e. no credits), but you DO get to put your initials in.\n\nHitting the Mystery Score shot will award you one of the following:\n\n 1M, 2M, 3M, or 5M.\n Light Extra Ball, Extra Ball.\n Light Special, Special.\n Palace Letter (NEVER gives you the last 'E', though).\n 2x, 3x, 5x playfield scores for 20 seconds.\n Clown Time.\n Instant Lock.\n Bonus Multiplier (can lead to lighting Extra Ball).\n Absolutely Nothing (IMHO, less insulting than Dr. Dude's \"A measly 10\npoints\").\n\nSo, in total, you could earn 1 of 16 different awards.  They should all be\nself-explanatory.  Getting Instant Lock is just like shooting all of the\nducks just before hitting the Juggler.  Very nice sometimes, when your\naiming just sucks for some reason.\n\nThe rest of the major scoring shots were discussed above.  All that's left\nto cover is...\nMultiball\nAs stated, shoot the ducks to light the locks, and shoot the Juggler to lock\nthe balls.  After 2 balls are locked, multiball starts.  If your machine is\nmissing a ball, locking the second ball starts Multiball right away (no\nwarning).\n\nThe main thing in Multiball is the Hurricane ramp.  The first shot is worth\n1M, the second 2M, and the third 5M.  Then it goes back to 1M and starts all\nover again.  So every 3 Hurricane shots is worth 8M.\n\nDuring Multiball, the Comet is just a timed shot.  So once you light the\nmillion, you can keep it lit for a long time and not worry about shooting\nsomething else.  A couple things to note:  Holding a flipper while shooting\nthe Comet seems to reset the value after getting a million.  They probably\ndon't want you to just hold a ball and continuously shoot the Comet.  BUT,\nif you shoot a ball into the Juggler, then while you're shooting for Comet\nmillions, it won't pop the ball out.  So you don't really NEED to hold a\nball on the flipper if you can get it to the Juggler.  The ball WILL pop out\nif you're not up to the million on the Comet yet.  Also, after the million\ntimes out, it resets to 50K right away.  So you don't have to shoot the\nFerris Wheel to relight it.  Plus, the Comet is lit at the beginning of\nMultiball if it was previously turned off.\n\nShooting the Ferris Wheel during Multiball will award you 750K.  If you get\na second ball up there fairly quickly, you'll get 1M.  And if you get the\nthird ball up into the Ferris Wheel, you get 2M points.  No Ferris Wheel\nbonus given during Multiball.  (But with Quick Scores like that, who cares?)\n\nIf you hit the ducks and cats during Multiball, you can still shoot the\nHurricane for the Palace letter, and you can still light the Jackpot.  If\nyou light the Jackpot by shooting the Hurricane right at the start of\nMultiball, you won't be awarded the Jackpot until ALL balls have left the\nJuggler.  Thankfully, the timer won't start until after all the balls have\nleft as well, so it evens out.  Basically, you can't backhand the ball into\nthe Juggler until the 3rd ball has been shot out.  If you do, then you must\nwait until THAT ball has cleared out as well.\n\nKeeping Multiball active for a long time is a really good thing to do,\nbecause after you lose 2 balls (or 1 for a 2-ball game), you go into\nmultiple-scoring mode.  For each second of Multiball you had, you get a\nsecond of multiple scoring (minimum 15 seconds, not sure of a maximum).  The\nplayfield multiplier seems totally random, though I could be wrong.  At any\nrate, there is a possible 2x, 3x, and even 5x playfield scores.  This means\nthat anything and everything that scores points is multiplied by that\namount.  This even includes the Skill Shot, but EXCLUDES the Jackpot.  (5x a\n15M Jackpot might be a little unfair.  %) )  So all millions, all Mystery\nawards, etc. are multiplied.\n\nOne other word about holding the flippers up during multiball:  Any time a\nflipper is up, the multiball timer for multiple scoring does NOT increase.\nIt won't reset your timer, but if you're holding a ball or something, the\ntimer stays where it is.  I've had upwards of 30 shots on the Hurricane\nduring multiball, then after losing a ball right after missing, only gotten\n15 seconds of multiple scoring.\nStrategies\nALWAYS shoot for the ducks.  Multiball is the key to high scores in this\ngame (as well as the multiplied scoring).  If you hit the ducks right, then\nyou'll wipe out the bottom 1 or 2 ducks, then catch the ball with the right\nflipper again, shoot the last target, and usually it'll bounce right into\nthe Juggler.  Ball locked.  If this works, then the Skill Shot will be worth\n*TWO* Palace letters (one for Skill Shot, one for just hitting the ducks).\nYou can light the Jackpot very quickly this way.\n\nDon't actively shoot for the Dummy.  It's usually a death shot if you miss\nit.  DO aim for it if the next bonus x's will get you extra ball lit.\n(Don't forget that the bonus x's number that's flashing is what you need to\nlight the extra ball.  On every game I've seen, it starts on the 3x, and\nafter you get that goes to 6x.  After 6x, it doesn't light anymore.  So off\nthe Dummy, you can get 2 extra balls.  Don't forget that when extra ball is\nlit, the flippers change the lane the extra ball is in, so shoot a ramp and\nmove the extra ball to the return lane where the ball will go.)\n\nDon't shoot the Comet millions until your first multiplied scoring.  It will\ntake you one less ramp to start getting 2, 3, or 5 million.  After you've\ngotten your first million run, though, it can't hurt to hit it whenever you\nfeel good or lucky.\n\nIf your next-to-last ball is about to drain in Multiball, start shooting the\nComet right away.  That way, you'll almost have million lit when multiple\nscoring kicks in.  If you cut off the million shot somehow, you have a\ncouple of choices:  Shoot the Ferris Wheel to light the Comet again (if you\nhave a LOT of time left!) or thrash at the ducks again.  If you can lock a\nball with a couple of seconds left on multiple scoring, you can get a\nmultiplied skill shot.  And this can be quite nice if your skill shot is up\nto 2M...\n\nALWAYS ALWAYS shoot for the Mystery Score in the Juggler if it's lit during\nmultiple scoring.  If you haven't done anything else at the start of\nmultiple scoring, then this should be your first target.  If you're shooting\nthe Comet, you should leave enough time to take a whack at the Mystery\nScore.  What many people fail to realize is that chances of getting millions\non the Mystery Score are pretty high, and when it's multiplied by 2, 3, or\n5, it can be very nice indeed.  A lot of people think that the Jackpot is\nthe highest-scoring single shot in the game.  Wrong.  If you're on 5x\nplayfield scores and shoot the Mystery Score and get 5 million, that's 25\nmillion points!  And even if you only get the 1, 2, or 3, that's still a\npretty good haul.  And if you don't get a points award at all, well, you\ncan't win them all.  Personally, in all the times I've played Hurricane (and\nthat's a lot), I've only gotten the 25 million shot twice.  But it's so neat\nwhen you do get it!  :)\n\nDuring Clown Time, the best strategy is to shoot the Comet as soon as the\nball returns from the Hurricane and just keep hitting it over and over.  If\nyou NEVER miss, you should be able to rack up around 12.5M during a single\nClown Time.\n\nIf you can hit the Hurricane easily (our machine has a *great* left flipper,\nwell, great for hitting the Hurricane ramp), don't bother going for the\njackpot.  Just keep hitting the Hurricane.  If you miss, then go ahead and\nshoot for the jackpot.  If you keep hitting it, eventually the jackpot will\ntime out.  After the jackpot round is over, you need to hit the ramp once\nmore to light if for letters again, then 3 more shots to re-light the\njackpot.  ONLY keep going for the ramp if you are getting millions.  If you\nlight it right away from, say, a skill shot, then go for the jackpot to get\nyour easy points, and save the extra ramp hit that you'd need to relight\nthe millions.\n\nHurricane is a great game to learn multiball ball control.  Once you get a\nball or two on the right flipper, just sit back and keep hitting the\nHurricane.  If you miss, and 2 or 3 balls wind up on the right flipper, just\ndo a quick flip to (hopefully) send 1 ball airborne so that it might bounce\nover to the left.  Then hit the Hurricane some more.\n\nWhen you get bored of constantly hitting the Hurricane, you can send a ball\nthat's sitting on the right flipper up into the Ferris Wheel, which will\ncome to the left flipper, where you can shoot BOTH (or all 3) balls at the\nHurricane to increase scoring 2X as fast.  :)  It's more exciting than\nshoot, wait, shoot, wait, etc.\n\nUsing these strategies, you should be able to do pretty well.  I've gotten\n269M on our local machine, which was probably a little liberal in the tilt\ndepartment at the time, but not overwhelmingly so.  Just remember to hit the\nducks for Multiball and wail on the Hurricane when you get there.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Hurricane", "possible_shots": "Hurricane, Comet, Ferris Wheel, Dummy, Juggler, Cats, Ducks, Bumpers, Palace, Jackpot, Clown's Face, Clown Time, Quick Score, Mystery, Ball Locks, Multiball, Skill Shot, Special, Status Report", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronics", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/hurricane.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Hurricane", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Thus, this little FAQ file.\n\nThis quasi-faq was assembled by me, with invaluable input from:\n\n\n bill\n Bill Anderson\n Michael Burke\n Federico \"Wiz\" Croci\n Andy Oakland\n Alan Whittle\n Uncle Willy\n\n\nPlus: the fine folks at pinGame journal\n\nAnd: a conversation with: Steve Ritchie\n\n\n Hyper-FAQ History\n Description\n Design Team & History\n Rules\n Mechanical and Repair Notes\n Flyer Text\n Conclusion\n\n\nHyper-FAQ History\n\nVersion 3.23 - Changes the description of  Steve Ritchie to\nEsteemed  :)\n\nVersion 3.22 - Corrects mislabeling of FAQ (Was labeled 3.1, should've\nbeen 3.2)\n\nVersion 3.2 - Corrects number of players from 4 to 2, adds additional\nflyer text, plus some notes on Steve Ritchie's past credits.\n\nVersion 3.0 - New Format: Corrects release date, adds design team\ninformation from Steve Ritchie\n\nVersion 2.0 - Adds text of Williams Brochure, courtesy F Croci\n\nVersion 1.0 - Incorporated input from Anderson, Burke, & Whittle\n\nVersion 0.5 - My original post on Hyperball.\n\nDescription\nHyperball was *NOT* a pinball machine. It *was* housed in a standard\npinball body/backglass. The best way to describe it is a shooting game in\na pinball housing with videogame rules.\n\nHyperball fired small ball bearings up the playfield. from a gun turret\nlocated where the middle drain would be on a pinball machine. The\ngame used 55  balls, .750\" diameter (3/4 of an inch). The center of the\nplayfield was open, with lights and artwork.  Up each side of the\nplayfield were holes where you could shoot the balls. The holes had\nletters (a,b,c,) Across the top were a series of hanging targets which\ncould be hit with the balls.\n\nYou controlled the game from two hand-grips with triggers, which\nrotated left  to right and back. In between the  hand grips was a\n*Z Bomb* button which would destroy all the attacking lights. You\nusually had three of those per game.\n\nDesign team & history\nHyperball was designed by the esteemed Steve Ritchie, longtime\nWilliams designer. Steve's design credits include many of my personal\nfavorites. In addition to Hyperball, he has given us:\n\n\n Airborne Avenger\n Superman\n Flash\n Stellar Wars\n Firepower\n Black Knight\n High Speed\n F-14 Tomcat\n Rollergames\n Black Knight 2000\n Terminator 2\n Getaway\n Star Trek the Next Generation\n No Fear\n\n\n(Thanks to Uncle Willy for the list!)\n\nHyperball was programmed by Ed Suchocki (pronounced:\nSUH-HOCKEY). Jerry Hendricks served as the mechanical engineer.\n\nSteve apparently wanted to design a video game, but it was not meant to\nbe. (Steve did design two video games that were never produced,\nDevastator (a 3-D space  game) and  Chicken ala King.) If you've\nplayed Hyperball, there is a definite Space Invaders feel to parts of it.\n\nHyperball was released by Williams Electronics originally at the 1982\nAMOA show. This initial version was apparently a mechanical\nnightmare. The game was substantially reworked in time for the 1983\nspring ACME show. One of the major problems was with the ball\nfeed/cannon firing system (see section <5>). The initial cannon\nproblems were solved by Mike Stroll, the president of Williams. In\naddition to being the president, Mike is also a talented engineer. The\noriginal four-inch barrel was shortened and flared, which greatly\nimproved the firing. Eventually, after a 14 month development cycle the\ngame was released as Game # 509, with a production run of 4,444.\n\nRules (From Michael Burke)\nGame Notes:\n\nThe object of the game is to shoot targets with the 'Hypercannon' (a\ncentre mounted gun solenoid thing) and avoid losing your 'Energy\nCentres' (of which you have 3 in the default setting). You also have a 'Z\nBomb' (a Defender type smart bomb) button on top of the machine\nwhich destroys all of the 'Lightning Bolts' as they \"walk\" around the\nplayfield.\n\nYou also have the option of spelling words as the display indicates and\nthis rewards you with huge amounts of points (if you spell it in the right\norder).\n\nEach time you complete a wave you move onto a more difficult level\nwhich means the lightning bolts attack you faster and move aggressively.\n\nOn waves 5, 10, 15 and so on, you have 'Reflex Waves' which involve\nshooting the lightning bolts in a pre-defined timespan (typically 2-3\nseconds) this awards you with a 50,000 bonus if you complete these\nwaves (its hard). If you don't complete these waves a\"YOU MISSED\"\nis displayed.\n\nSound effects:\n\nIt uses the classic Williams sounds from that era, including many\nDefender sounds and the walking sounds from Robotron (another\nfavourite of mine).\n\nNote from Scott - Steve Ritchie was a conceptual contributor to\nDefender, so this is only fitting.\n\nAn absolutely awesome game that has huge amounts of \"Firepower\"\n(another great Williams game) and takes quite a number of years to\nmaster...\n\nMechanical and repair notes\nHyperball was a great deal of fun, but it's main problem appears to have\nbeen that it was a maintenance nightmare. Bill Anderson has the best\nread on this.\n\n(Begin description from Bill)\n\nAs part of a deal I rebuilt a couple of Hyperballs Rick Schieve owned.\n\nThe ball feed mechanism took the greatest amount of time\nduring the restorations due to disassembly and reassembly.\nThey needed bead blasting to be cleaned, and I removed all\nburrs on the spindle used to lift the balls.\n\nIn regards to the post by Robert Cole:\n\n\"I actually liked it.  Not as a game per se, but for the\ntechnical aspects.  It used a linear accelerator to fire\nballs with a theoretical speed of four balls per second\nwith an initial speed a metre and a half a second.  Because\nof the impulse power required to fire the balls, the surge\nprotection on the power lines was a problem and the power\nsupply to the coils was incredible.  I would love to get\none of these and see if I could build it into a shooting\ngallery type game.\"\n\nIt's simply a coil whose plunger has a special tip extension.\nYou can fire as fast as the hopper can load the balls through\ngravity feed, and a fan cools the coil.  I wound up using\nthe plunger from an extra playfield as in one machine the\nplunger was not hitting the center of the ball.  This deformed\nthe plunger tip, causing the ball hit the barrel of the gun\ninstead of coming straight out, thus affecting the speed.  I'd\nsay that under aligned conditions after the rebuild the ball\nspeed well exceeded 1.5 meters/second.\n\nFlyer Text\nThanks to Federico Croci, here is the text from the giveaway instruction\nbook/flyer.\n\nHYPER-TACTICS\nTHIS is the new way to play!\n\nHYPER-ACTION\nArmed with a Hyper-Cannon(TM) that can fire an incredible 250 balls\na minute, the player must manipulate 2 trigger mechanisms to protect\nthe Energy Center, the vital core of HYPERBALL(TM), from lightning\nbolts bent on draining its strength. 1 or 2 players can command this\nhyper-action. For standard 25c play and 2 Energy Centers, press 1 or 2\nplayer start button once; for extended 50c play and 5 Energy Centers,\npress 1 or 2 player start button twice. Each Energy Center is powered\nby 5 Energy Units.\n\nTARGETS SIGNAL ATTACK\nLights sequence from target to target on both sides of the playfield. The\nHyper-Cannon(TM) must score a direct hit at the lit target to stop the\nattacker from reaching the top.\n\nFROM LIGHTS TO LIGHTNING BOLTS\nIf the sequencing lights reach the top of the playfield, they become\nlightning bolts which, if not blasted by the Hyper-Cannon(TM), streak\ndownward to drain power from the Energy Center. Each bolt that\nstrikes the Energy Center drains 1 Energy Unit.\n\nBEWARE THE BAITER\nThe most dangerous of enemies that must be destroyed at all costs is the\nflashing Baiter. The elusive Baiter appears randomly and not only fires\nbolts at the Energy Center to drain Energy Units, but also dodges from\nside to side, making it more difficult to destroy. If the Baiter itself\nreaches the Energy Center, it will drain all remaining energy.\n\nPLAY BY THE \"LETTERS\"\nTo extend play, hitting the flashing letter target specified on the\nalpha-numeric display earns Z Bombs, Energy Units or Bonus Points.\n\nTHE LATEST \"WORD\" IN SCORING\nSpelling the word flashed on the alpha-numeric display awards even\nmore Z Bombs, Energy Units or Bonus Points. To earn this high\nscoring bonus, the specified word must be spelled in sequence. If the\nword is not completed before the end of a wave, what has been spelled\ncomes back on the next wave and the word can even continue to be\nspelled when it is no longer showing on the display.\n\nCONDITION: CRITICAL\nWhen only 1 Energy Unit remains, \"critical\" is flashed on the alpha-\nnumeric display.\n\nFOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY\nWhen destruction of the Energy Center is imminent, a limited number\nof Z Bombs can be activated to eliminate all enemies from the playfield.\nZ Bomb will also score the bonus of any flashing letter target.\n\nTHE SCORE AND MORE\nScoring is awarded for hitting lit targets or bolts. Smashing 30 bolts\ncompletes an attack wave and awards a bonus equal to the number of\nremaining Energy Units times the wave completed times 1000. An\nadditional Energy Center and Z Bomb are awarded for every 400,000\npoints.\n\nFLEX YOUR REFLEXES\nEvery 5th wave is a Special Reflex Wave. A target lights randomly and\na rapidly decreasing score value is entered on the display. Hitting the\ntarget stops the countdown and the remaining score is awarded. There\nare 20 lit targets per wave. After the first 5 targets, failing to hit a lit\ntarget in the time allotted ends the wave with a \"you missed\" on the\ndisplay. Completing a Reflex Wave earns an additional bonus and a\n\"great reflex\" on the display.\n\nCLAIM TO FAME\nWhen a new high score is achieved, \"great score-enter your initials\"\nregisters on the display. With the trigger mechanisms, the left one\nselecting letters from Z to A and the right from A to Z, the player can\nenter his initials, locking them in with the Z Bomb button. The player's\ninitials, high score, number of waves completed are all displayed to tell\nthe world he's champion of the bold, new way to play!\n\nThis next section came from another flyer, which was reprinted in\npinGame journal, #11, page 14.\n\n1st page  - A game encounter of the 3rd kind\n\nAcross the 2nd-3rd pages - First pin... Then video   Now the next\nevolution in games  hyperball\n\nEvolution\nNeither pin nor video, Hyperball evolves from an advanced technology\nthat goes beyond these concepts to create a bold, new way to play.  The\ndynamics, excitement and \"feel\" of pinball and the intense, demanding\nskill of video come together in a new generation of game that will be\nplayed for generations to come!\n\nRevolution\nArmed with the incredible firing power of 250 balls a minute, Hyperball\nis revolutionizing play with shots heard 'round the world.  The Energy\nCenter is the throbbing, vital core of the game that must be protected by\nsuper skill and quick coordination from the lightning bolts bent on\ndraining it's strength!\n\nRevelation\nThe unique play and technological innovations of Hyperball are a\nrevelation! For \"hyper-action\" that never quits, there's the first ever\nalpha-numeric display that demands entirely new strategies and\nreactions, making Hyperball a constantly changing arena for constantly\nchallenging play!  For ultra-reliability, micro-switches and opto\nswitches are deployed in all critical areas.  And the wear-resistant\nplexiglass playfield won't give out before the players do!\n\nConclusion\nHyperball's maintenance is often cited as the main reason it didn't\nbecome a smashing success, spawning a slew of similar games. Another\nreason Hyperball never survived is that it never fit neatly into a\ncategory. The vid-kids left it alone, and the pinheads weren't quite\nsure what to do with it. I enjoyed it, and it does have something of a cult\nfollowing. We here at r.g.p. have sort of  adopted it as a prodigal\ncousin. (Hey, it looked like a pin, had two players, it used steel balls, it\ncame from Williams) .\n\nThere you have it.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Independence Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Independence Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence Day\n\nVersion 2.2 4/10/98\n\nCompiled By Robert Macauley\n\nHTML conversion by Chris Bonney\n\n\nThe following is an attempt at a rule sheet for Sega's\n(alias Data East's) latest creation Independence Day. First\nthe legal stuff. Independence Day, ID4 and any other reference to\nthe movie is copyright 20th Century Fox and I don't need any\nhassles from them so just imagine tm after each mention of their\nname. Sega are licensed to release the ID4 pinball. Multiball and\nI guess several other features mentioned here are copyrighted by\nsomebody out there. This is of no interest to me (I just play the\ngames, I don't own em). This rule sheet is released as\nfreeware and as such may be used in any manner you wish, just as\nlong as no profit is made from it's use and we still get\nsome credit for it's existence. And now on with the show.\n\nThe Story So Far\n\nIn the beginning it was a dark and cold night when something\ncaught my eye as I was driving home. In the front window of a\nlocal machine operator's showroom I saw it: the Independence\nDay pinball. After drooling on the window for a while (not a good\nlook I admit) I didn't give it much more thought at that\nstage.\nThe scene now shifts to mid September while playing Theatre of\nMagic. I was told that ID4 was on site at an indoor sports Centre\nand I decided to check it out. It wasn't there when I\narrived but was back on site 3 days later. After 2 hours playing\nthe idea for this sheet was born.\n\nChanges for this Version \n\nSection on League Mode and Wizard Mode added. All text moved\nto the left a fair way to allow all words to appear when printed.\nSorry to anyone who printed copies of version 1.0 and found it\nhard to read. I'm new to all this. Bragging section added.\nSome new awards added. A little bit of a tidy up. This version\nshould be the last.\nThe Movie\n\nSaw it, liked it but thought it was a little over the top in\nthe realism department but entertaining none the less. At least\nnow some modes in the game make more sense.\nPlayfield Layout\n\nStarting at the drain and going around clockwise:\nOutlanes- Normal. They seem reasonably forgiving. Can be lit\nfor Special.\nInlanes- Normal. Always lit for Light Combo. \nFlippers- 2 lower and 1 upper on the right like Getaway. All\nnormal length.\nSlingshots- Normal size and shape.\nArea 51 targets- 3 targets in the same spot as the relight\nkickback on Getaway. Lighting all 3 lights Alien Scan.\nLeft Orbit- Standard orbit shot. When lit for combo the ball\nloops right around. Unlit shots feed to the bumpers. Orbits\nadvance the bumper value. Also awards Hurry up and jackpot.\nLeft Ramp- Awards 5M, 10M and 20M towards Red Alert and awards\njackpots. Weak shots fall back into a sinkhole behind the lock.\nFeeds to the right flipper.\nF-18 targets- 3 targets in the same spot as the Itt targets on\nAddams Family. Light all 3 to start Hurry-up.\nUpper Orbit- A loop shot like on Getaway, shot from the upper\nflipper. Awards Rockwell 1947 which is 5M + 5M per loop. Also\nstarts Area 51 Multiball and awards Area 51 jackpots in this\nmode.\nYellow Target- Spots an ID4 lane. \nCombo Target- A smaller version of the train wreck on Addams\nFamily. Awards combo jackpot when lit. When not lit spots one of\n5 or 6 Aliens. Spotting them all awards 50M.\nLock- An Alien head which opens when hit to reveal a sinkhole.\nShoot the hole to lock the ball. Also awards the first jackpot.\nAlien Ramp- Feeds the ball to above the upper flipper. Lights\nExtra Ball at 5 ramps and awards it at 6. Also awards 10M at 10\nramps, 15M at 15 ramps and 20M after 20 ramps. I assume this\ncontinues on in this manner. Also awards jackpots.\nID4 Lanes- 3 lanes set at a slight angle which are hard to see\nat times. Light all 3 to advance bonus X to a max. of 10X.\nGreen Alien Targets- 3 targets spaced between the lock and the\nramps. Light all 3 for 10M.\nRight Ramp- Spots 5M, 10M and 20M towards Red Alert. Also\nawards jackpot. Feeds to the right flipper.\nJet Bumpers- 3 bumpers in the usual triangle formation. Each\nhit advances the hurry-up value.\nRight Orbit- Same as the left except it doesn't award\nHurry-up.\nComputer Virus- A sinkhole similar to the altar on Dracula but\nin a lower position. Each shot advances the virus by 20%.\nReaching 100% lights the right orbit for 100M.\nRules and Modes\n\nNot really much in the way of modes thankfully:\nRed Alert- 3 shots up the left an right ramps starts Red\nAlert. This is a Payback Time type of mode where each shot up the\n2 ramps is worth 50M for 30 seconds. This can be worth a lot.\nHurry Up- Light the upper 3 bank to start hurry-up. The\nbumpers advance the hurry-up value from a minimum of 20 mil. Each\nhit increases the value by 250k and each orbit shot increases\nthis by 50k. After lighting hurry-up you have 30 seconds to shoot\nthe left orbit to freeze the value. After you hit the first shot,\neach shot to the left orbit awards that value again until the\ntimer expires. Each hurry-up requires you to complete the 3 bank\nan additional time.\nArea 51- Light the lower 3 bank to light Alien Scan. Hit the\nbank again to collect. Alien Scan awards include: Light Area 51\nMultiball, Alien Frenzy, 50M and Hold Bonus. There must be other\nawards.\nArea 51 Multiball- The Centre orbit starts the mode. Each shot\nto the loop awards a jackpot which starts at 50 mil. Hitting any\nflashing target advances the jackpot value to a maximum of 90M.\nThe green targets add a ball the first time they are hit. Ends\nwhen 1 ball remains.\nCombos- The left and right return lanes light the orbits for\ncombos. A combo is worth 5M and increases by 1 mil per shot. This\nalso lights the combo target for a combo jackpot of 15M.\nMultiball- Hit the alien to open the lock. Shoot the sinkhole\nto lock the ball. Locked balls are fed to the right flipper from\na vuk like the one on Jurassic Park. Each lock must be lit\nindividually but Multiball is lit at the start of ball 3 if you\nhaven't had it. Lock 3 balls to start Multiball. The aim is\nto score as many jackpots as you can. The first jackpot is a shot\nto the lock worth 40M. This lights the orbits for double jackpot\n80M. The 3rd wave of jackpots are the 3 ramps for triple jackpot\n120 mil. During the triple jackpot wave hitting the Area 51\ntargets adds a ball once for each target. Getting all 3 triple\njackpots lights the combo target for super jackpot 160M. After\ncollecting the super jackpot the values reset to 40 mil and the\ncycle starts again, however balls can't be added in wave 3.\nFor subsequent Multiballs the Alien must be hit an additional\ntime to open the lock. There may be a limit but it is at least 5\nhits for each lock.\nRear Sinkhole- Weak shots up the left ramp fall back into a\nhole. This advances the date starting at July 2 and gives a quote\nfrom the movie. I can't work out if there is any\nsignificance to this. The dates advance one day at a time up to\nJuly 4, then shows July 4 (later) before going on to July 5 and\nawarding 25M.\nBonus Count- As far as I can tell the end of ball bonus is\nworked out like this:\nArea 51-- 1 mil per hit\nAlien Bonus-- 1M per Alien ramp\nID4 Bonus-- 1M per rollover.\nAlien Frenzy (1M jets) if started\nAll X bonus X value (max. 10X)\nI could be wrong as it all happens so quickly.\n\nRandom Notes\n\nAll modes pause during Multiballs. Therefore it is not\npossible to have more than one thing going at a time.\nThe Extra Ball and Replay animations are good. EB shows the\nWhite House exploding while Replay shows the building in L A\nwhere the party was happening in the movie. Most animation is OK\nbut I'm not sure about the word Multiball appearing on the\nAlien ship.\nThe double jackpot plays a very bad Elvis impersonation from\nthe movie. Below the bottom flippers are a pair of Alien eyes\nwhich light up when you flip. White lights for a flip and green\nlights if you hold the flipper. this is a nice touch.\nThe ball can be launched by pressing both flippers which is\nnot very nice. I hope this can be disabled.\nSometimes on an outlane drain you get the animation of a fat\nlady with pigtails hitting a high note. This is a reference to\nthe movie and a saying It's not over until the fat lady\nsings. Not a bad touch.\nMost games these days display the anti drug message just say\nno to drugs . ID4 displays the message Just say no to Alien\nInvasion.\nThe last person to get super jackpot gets their name on the\nhigh score table as the ID4 Super Jackpot. It feeds the ego but\nthats about all.\nIs it my imagination or does the 20th Century Fox logo in\nattract mode look like Pox not Fox. No legal action please.\nThe 4 player game is a team game like Baywatch or Batman\nForever. Bad Idea\nThere is no grace period for scoring jackpots, all modes end\nimmediately the timer reaches zero and ball save ends as soon as\nthe light goes off.\nA shot to the right orbit before getting the first jackpot\nadds 5 million to the jackpot values. It's a hard shot during\nmultiball and not worth the effort.\nWizard Mode and League Mode\n\nHolding in the left flipper button when you press start\nenables League Mode. I don't know what the difference is to\nregular play but I can't see anything yet. Holding in the\nright flipper enables Wizard Mode. The only difference I can see\nhere is that it takes 3 hits to open each lock the first time and\nI think 6 hits the second time. There must be other changes but I\nwasn't playing too well at the time so I haven't found\nany. During one game I had 2.9M at the start of ball 3 but hadn't\nhad multiball. Despite that the machine didn't light lock 3 which\nwas not very nice at all. This could be a feature but I'm not\nsure.\nQuotes\n\nJust a few from memory:\nHurry-up-- Kick the tires and light the fires big daddy.\nStart of Multiball-- All right Mr President here we go.\nDouble jackpot-- Thank you very much. (Done in an Elvis voice)\nDestroy Alien ship-- In the words of our generation..UP YOURS!!\nRed Alert-- I have GOT to get me one of these.\n100M in a mode-- You da man big daddy.\nJuly 2-- They're gonna kill us all.\nJuly 4-- Today, we celebrate our Independence Day.\nMatch-- Look at you. Ship all banged up.\nGame over-- Now thats what I call a close encounter.\nStart of Extra Ball--Enjoy this Extra Ball it may be your last.\nTips\n\nNot much to think of really. Red Alert is the only really high\nscoring mode, although the game is fairly big on points. If you\ncan master the left ramp and the machine allows you to pass the\nball to the right flipper, keep shooting the left ramp for 20 mil\nper shot. This ramp is as narrow as the one on Indy so be\ncareful.\nDeath Saves are definitely possible especially on a right\noutlane drain. In fact this is the first machine that I ever\nsuccessfully pulled off a Death Save on.\nMilk the hurry up value for all it's worth. This tip was\nobserved by Koi Morris at the Flip Out '96 tournament. His\ndiscription is as follows.\n1. Shoot the left orbit when combo shot is not lit on that orbit.\n2. This feeds the ball to the bumpers and increases the bumper\nadvance value by 50k. You may want to shake the machine a bit to\nkeep the ball in the bumper area.\n3. When the ball eventually leaves the bumpers, hold the right\nflipper up and the ball should roll along the raised flipper and\ngo to the left flipper.\n4. Raise the left flipper and the ball should roll off the left\nflipper and go to the right flipper for a trap or a catch.\n5. Shoot the orbit again over and over as much as possible. Koi\nsuggests collecting the hurry up at 500M+. Light the hurry up and\ncollect it as often as possible within the time limit. I've also\nbeen able to let the ball bounce from the left flipper to the\nright or do a drop catch and shoot either the right orbit or the\nalien ramp from the left flipper. Balls coming off the alien ramp\ncan also be passed to the left flipper this way as the ball is\ntraveling at the same speed as if it had come out of the\nbumpers. So far I haven't built the value up to 500M but I'm\nworking on it. The only problems with trick is that at first it\ntakes a while to build the value up and it is annoying if you\nstart hurry up after all that work and drain without collecting\nall the points.\nBragging \n\nMy best so far is 6.7 Billion. My best Red Alert total is\n750M.\nHighest hurry-up collected is somewhere near 250M\nShameless Plug\n\nA Plain text version of this sheet can be found at the Temple of Pinball\nIf you have any corrections or additions please e-mail them to\nme via chrisb@enternet.com.au\nand I may include them in a later version.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Indiana Jones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Indiana Jones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian's Guide to\nIndiana Jones the Pinball Adventure\n\nVersion 2.3\n\n\nThis rulesheet has been compiled and is maintained by me (Adrian)\nwith a substantial amount of input from a lot of r.g.p readers and\nis kept on the pinball archive at rahul.net.  If you find anything\nthat is incorrect or missing, mail me and I'll make an effort to\ninclude it.\n\nDisclaimer: The usual; Indiana Jones the Pinball Adventure is surely a\na trademark of Williams Electronic Games Inc., and is\nlicensed from Lucasfilm.  Multi-Ball is also a Williams\ntrademark.\n\nPreliminary Notes:\n\nThe machine I play, and consequently what this sheet is largely\nbased on, is running L-6 ROM's which is the latest revision I've\nheard of.  There are a lot of differences between the various\nrevisions which suggests that the initial P-x ROMs were riddled\nwith bugs.  Wherever possible I have tried to list the\ndifferences in the software, but I doubt I know them all so\ndon't be surprised if your mileage varies from what is written\nbelow.\n\nAs well as the software differences, it should also be noted\nthat nearly everything is operator settable making it almost\nimpossible to compile definitive rules although I understand\nthat some of these settings have disappeared in later ROMs.\n\nAlthough game play is fairly straight forward, there is a lot\nto be uncovered in a prolonged game. I doubt you would be able\nto say you had got everything until you had at least 3B points\nracked up.\nPlayfield Layout\nNote that this is a widebody machine of the same proportions as\nThe Twilight Zone.  I will only state briefly what is there for now,\nmore detail will be contained in the description of play.\nStarting from the left flipper and going anti-clockwise things on the\nplayfield are as follows:\n\n\nLeft Inlane/OutlaneThe inlane lights Hand of Fate when lit and Special\ncan be scored from the outlane when lit. As is common with most\ncurrent machines the outlane can be adjusted but nowhere near as\nfar as on TZ.\nA-D-V TargetsA group of three stand up targets - the first of three such\ngroups which spell out the word ADVENTURE.\nLeft OrbitDepending on the mode the player is in, a shot around here\nwill either continue around and feed back to the right flipper,\nor be stopped by a gate at the top of the playfield.\nMode SaucerJust to the right of the orbit is a short (2\") tunnel with\na saucer at the end.  This is where Modes, the Hand of Fate and\nExtra Ball are collected when lit.\nADVENTURE PlayfieldThe Indiana Jones equivalent of TZ's Battle the\nPower, this is a raised section of playfield which can be\ntilted left or right by the flippers to guide the ball over\nsome of the 8 rollovers and collect The Pit or Extra Ball. It takes\nat least two shots to the upper playfield to score all the\nrollovers.\nBeta cabinets have metal walls on this section - production ones\nhave red plastic walls.\nLeft RampFairly steep ramp feeding to the left inlane via a habitrail.\nUsed extensively by the Modes and to light the Jackpot shot in\nMulti-Ball.\nE-N-T TargetsThree drop targets spelling the ENT bit of ADVENTURE.\nBetween them, they cover a Raise Jackpot target and the entrance\nto the Lock/Hurry Up.\nRaise JackpotA small target located behind the E-N drop targets used\nduring Multi-Ball, Dogfight and others.\nLock & Hurry UpA sinkhole located behind the E-N-T targets which can be\nshot with just the 'T' down.\nPop BumpersThe traditional triangular arrangement of 3 situated behind\nthe sinkhole and under the left ramp. The ball can be fired up\nback through the I-N-D-Y rollovers or leave down from the left\norbit or down from the Captive Ball.\t\nI-N-D-Y RolloversBehind the Pop Bumpers. Spell INDY to advance Bonus X\nand light a Friend. Lit rollovers can be moved left/right by the\nflippers.\nCaptive BallA lane just to the right of the 'T' leads to a single drop\ntarget which protects the captive ball. Hit the ball for Quick\nMulti-Ball and Super Jackpot.\nNote: The Captive Ball has two switches, one at the front and\none at the back. The one at the back generally awards higher\npoints but not much else.\nRight RampAnother steep one. Used a lot by the Modes and can be lit\nfor Jackpot and Path to Adventure. Normally feeds to the right\nflipper but will go to the left from Jackpot and Adventure.\nRight OrbitUsed mainly during certain Modes. Works in the same way\nas the left orbit.\nU-R-E TargetsThe third group of targets making up ADVENTURE. These\nface opposite the A-D-V targets and are also the stand up type.\nThe IdolSort of like a horizontal version of FT's fishing reel, this\nis where up to three locked balls are kept. Balls released from\nthis go across the right outlane to the right flipper.\nThere is a sound effect of an elephants' trumpet before each\nball is released - very useful during Multi-Ball.\nRight Inlane/OutlaneSame as the left, the inlane lights Hand of Fate\nand the outlane is good for a Special when lit.  The divider\nfor these two lanes has a one-way gate at the crook which allows\nballs fed from the Idol to get to the flipper, and at the crook\nof the outlane there is a post which will give skilled players\nto opportunity to bounce the ball back into the inlane. It can\nbe opened up a loooonnnggggg way though (further than TZ's left\noutlane!!).\nFlippers/SlingshotsJust the two of each in the usual places - flippers\nare full length and apparently will stay that way as the machine\nis not shipped with the small ones. Also, the gap between them\nis quite small.\n\nPlayfield Awards\n\nSkill ShotThere ain't one ..... :)\n\nI-N-D-Y RolloversAs with most things in IJ, the INDY rollovers serve\nmore than one purpose: increasing the bonus multiplier, lighting\nIndy's Friends and (of course) scoring points.  Completing them\nincreases BonusX (2x, 4x, 6x & 8x) and lights one of Indy's\nFriends (see Orbits: below), and relights the inlanes for Hand\nof Fate.  Once you have reached 8x, subsequent INDY's are worth\na 10M 'Maximum Bonus' award (not P-3 ROMs) but there is a twist :)\nAt 8x, Extra Ball is also lit at the Mode Saucer.  Collecting it\n(or a 'Max Bonus') will cause BonusX to be reset to 1x on the\nnext ball.  This is probably the easiest way to get lotsa EB's.\n\nSuper PopsEnough hits on the pop bumpers will start Super Pops where\nall hits are worth 1M each.  75 hits is the magic number, but it\nis (of course) operator settable. Once lit, Super Pops is active\nuntil end of ball which could lead to monster scoring. Each\nsuccessive Super Pops starts after 50 more hits than the previous\none (ie 125, 175, 225 etc).\n\nNarrow EscapeScores 1M after a right outlane drain which is saved\nthrough the gate to the inlane. Second Narrow Escape is worth\n2M, third 3M and so on. This value is held throughout the game\nand apparently has no limit (Kevin has had it up to 52M!).\n\nNote: The game recognises a Narrow Escape when the first rollover\nin the outlane is hit, but not the second. Therefor, it is quite\ncommon to score it even when you actually drain - especially when\nthat post is open to the max.  Also, it is possible to trip the\noutlane switch while the ball is deciding which lane it is going\nto go down - this will also score a Narrow Escape\n\nOrbitsLeft and right orbit shots are worth 1M + (2M x Lit Friends) when\nlit. This provides a minimum of 3M per loop since you get one\nfree Friend lit and a max of 11M per loop.  Consecutive lit\nloops are worth 2X, 3X, 4X the base with no known limit (7x is\nthe highest I've heard of).  If you are good at loops, you can\nget some pretty huge scores from lit loops .. :)\n\nLoop JackpotThis could also be called a 'Friends Jackpot' and is\nscored in the following manner:  Light all friends from the INDY\nrollovers (lit Friends are denoted by a flashing light between\nthe slingshots), shoot lit loops to light each Friend solidly\n(as opposed to flashing) then shoot the right ramp to collect\nthe jackpot.  Scoring is the total of all lit loops collected\nbefore the Jackpot is collected, to a maximum of 200M.  The base\nat the start of the game is 5M.  If you fail to collect the Loop\nJackpot before the end of the ball when you light it, both the\nFriends and the Loop Jackpot value are reset (value becomes 0M).\n\nNote: If the right ramp is lit for Multiball jackpot and Friends\njackpot, one hit will collect both but only the animation\nfor Friends is displayed..\n\nRampsMaking a lit ramp is worth 1M and lights the alternate ramp\nvia the inlane. Hitting alternating ramps in succession\nwill score 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M and so on....\n\nDogfightShooting left and right ramps when lit will also spot a green,\nwinged light (seen amongst the Mode lights on the playfield).\nCompleting all six will start a Dogfight. Hurry Up is lit and\ncounts down from 40M, shoot the sinkhole behind the E-N-T\ntargets or the Raise Jackpot target to collect.\n\nNote: The countdown will not start if the T target is still\nstanding so it is possible to score the whole 40M in\nthe same way that you might get a 'You cheat Dr Jones',\nor hitting the Raise Jackpot.\n\nQuick Multi-BallThree successful shots to the the drop target protecting\nthe Captive Ball will cause it to stay down and the captive\nball be lit for 2 ball Multi-Ball for  20 secs. During this\nMulti-Ball shoot the Captive Ball to collect items.\nDrop target hits are worth 1M, 2M, 3M for the three hits.\nThere are five items which can be collected from the Captive\nBall during Quick Two Ball Multiball as follows:\n\n\n The Idol of The Incas   (10M)\n The Diamond of Shanghai (15M)\n The Remains of Nurhachi (20M)\n The Cross of Coronado   (25M)\n The Fish of Tayles      (30M)\n\n\nEach subsequent hit is worth a 40M 'All Treasures Collected'\nscore with the first of these lighting the outlanes for Special.\nIf you do not get all the treasures on the first 2-Ball, they\nremain spotted next time you get the Quick Two Ball.\n\nNote: A good solid hit on the Captive Ball which causes the back\nswitch to close adds an extra 10M to the above values. This is\nalso sometimes called the Totem Multiball.\n\nDuring Quick Multi-Ball, all values on the Path of Adventure are\ndoubled.  I don't know if this includes the Pit value.\n\nThe Hand of Fate Lit from the inlanes and scored by hitting the Mode\nsaucer. Lighting the inlanes is done by collecting INDY. If it\nis not collected at the saucer within a certain time it will\ntimeout. The inlanes start out lit for 'Light Hand of Fate' at\nthe beginning of each ball.\n\nThe  animation  is  similar  to  the  Mystery  award  on\nWhiteWater and is displayed twice - first showing a list of 4\nawards and then choosing and awarding one of them. The list of\n4 is selected from a larger list which includes:\n\n\n 10M points, 20M points, Lite Extra Ball, Eternal Life,\n Quick Multi-Ball, Bonus X, Dogfight, Loop Person,\n Lock Ball, Lite Path , Super Pops.\n\n\nNotes: Loop Person spots one of Indy's friends, and the Eternal\nLife timer is operator settable. Lock Ball will increment\nthe count of balls locked regardless of whether there are\nballs in the Idol or not.\n\nIf Light Extra Ball is on the list of 4, it is always the\none which is awarded for some strange reason.\n\nPath of AdventureThe letters from the word ADVENTURE can be spotted in\non of two ways: either a direct hit on the corresponding target,\nor a hit on any of the three groups (ADV, ENT, URE) once that\ngroup is lit which will spot the next unlit letter. To explain\nthe latter, if you have ADV_Ent_uRe, a hit on the ADV bank will\nspot 'N' for you.  The 'Raise Jackpot' target will spot a letter\nif ENT are down.\n\nCompleting all the ADVENTURE targets lights the right ramp for Path\nof Adventure. When complete, shooting the right ramp gets you with\nthe chance of playing on the raised mini-playfield. The objective\nhere is to tilt the field left and right in an attempt to steer\nthe ball over the lit rollovers (indicated by yellow lights) or\ninto one of the holes (The Pit & Extra Ball). The number of lit\nrollovers increases by one each time you complete the Path\nwithout collecting The Pit, up to a max of 6.\n\nAwards are as follows:  First set of rollovers completed lights\nExtra Ball. Subsequent completed Path's light and then raise\nthe Pit value by 25M to a max of 150M.  Each lit rollover is\nworth 5M with a further 1M for each time you completed ADVENTURE\nwithout actually playing PoA. (limit of 10M per rollover)\nOnce you have collected The Pit, PoA is still lit, but now the\nlit rollovers are traveling (this is new for L-3) - I assume\nthe value of The Pit is reset. Hitting the first set of\ntraveling rollovers relights the EB hole on the raised playfield.\n\nPath of Adventure will remain lit until the 15 sec timer expires,\nor you drain. Complete ADVENTURE again to relight.\n\nThe Modes\nIt would have been nice to see these with a better definition than just\nMode - some sort of big concept that they are based around. Admittedly,\nI can't think of anything that might fit the bill though.\n\nAnyway, there are 12 of them based on significant scenes from the three\nmovies (4 modes for each movie) which are displayed in the big open\nspace in the centre of the playfield. They are collected by hitting the\nStart Mode saucer which is always lit unless there is another Mode or\nMulti-Ball running (it needs to be - the shot is harder than TZ's Slot\nMachine IMHO).\n\nThere is a 5M bonus just for starting any of the 12 Modes which are\nlisted below in the order you would read them off the playfield:\n\n\nCastle GrunewaldHit the drop target, then pound away at the Captive\nBall for points. Scoring is 5M, 10M & 15M for the three hits\nrequired for you to 'escape' from the castle making a total 35M\n(5M for starting) for the round.\n\nIn L-5 revision, nailing the Captive Ball so that it hits the\nsecond switch doubles the score for that shot (ie 10, 20 & 30M).\n\nTank ChaseAnimation of Indy on a horse chasing a tank. Orbit value\nstarts at 15M and counts down to 5M. Each loop gets Indy a bit\ncloser to the tank and enough of them will get him onboard to\nto destroy the tank for a 30M end of mode bonus.\n\nNote: The loop does not actually need to be completed to count.\nEarly ROM's would count a loop if the two rollovers in the\nlane were hit in quick succession. Therefor you could get\na loop credit from a ball leaving the pop bumpers on the\nleft.  Later revisions require that the bottom rollover\nbe hit first.\n\nThree ChallengesShoot the right ramp for the Path to Adventure raised\nplayfield. Challenges 1,2 & 3 are completed by hitting all lit\nrollovers for 10M, 20M & 30M respectively. All lit rollovers\nhave to be hit during one pass of the Path to collect the\npoints. This is pretty easy since they are usually in a row on\none or other side of the Path (although Keefer claims to have had\ntwo next to each other on opposite sides!).\nThe switches which are lit depends on whether The Pit has been\ncollected or not; if not, you will have to hit 1, 2 & 3 switches\nfor the Challenges; if it has, you will have to hit traveling\nlights but there is a bug here which makes it pretty useless at\nthis point anyway (see Bugs: below)\n\nChoose WiselyAnimation of the knight telling you to choose wisely.\nFive identical chalices are displayed, you are told which is\nthe genuine article then you have to keep your eye on it\nwhile they are shuffled around. Then select using the flippers\nand choose by pulling the trigger on the gun (the plunger).\nWorth 5M if you blow it, 20M bonus if you get it right.\nClassic animation if you get it wrong ...... ;)\nSubsequent attempts are at different speeds and buggy (see Bugs:\nbelow).\n\nMonkey BrainsRather gross display of a monkey's head with the brain\nexposed to the world and steaming happily. Hitting ramps and\norbits scores 8M each and allows you to eat some brain (yuk!).\nThe animation for this mode is quite entertaining if you are\nthat way inclined, and the BUUUURRRRRPPPP sound effect is one\nof my favourites. This is a timed Mode with no end of Mode bonus.\n\nNote: See Tank Chase note regarding loop scoring.\n\nSteal the StonesShoot the right ramp for a chance to steal the\nStones (yellow flashing lights) from the raised Path of Adventure\nplayfield. Each stolen stone is worth 5M and there is a 20M\nbonus for collecting all 8.\n\nSecond time round, the last 4 stones float and you need to hit\nthe last 2 of these on one pass to complete the Mode.\n\nEscape in the CartVideo Mode animation of Indy going through a mine\nin a cart.  Use the flippers to choose which way to go to\navoid the barriers - make 25 correct decisions to complete the\nmode and escape. Scoring is 5M plus 1M for each correct turn\nand 10M bonus for getting half way and 30M for completion. Note\nthat the cart gets faster and faster the more turns you make,\nand there are minor bugs here too (see Bugs: below).\n\nSurvive the Rope BridgeTimed round in which Indy is trying to cross\nthe bridge. Successive ramp shots will move him further along\nand score 10M each. Four ramps are required to get him across,\nand a fifth to cut the rope. An Extra Ball will be lit at the\nMode saucer if you complete the round.\n\nGet the IdolThe objective of this Mode is to steal the Idol by\nshooting the lock sinkhole. This is complicated by the ENT\ntargets which keep resetting and getting in the way. Each reset\nis accompanied by a quote as follows:\n\n\n Start Mode:  There's nothing to fear here.\nThat's what scares me.\n First hit :  Throw me the whip.\n Second hit:  Throw me the Idol.\n Third hit :  Give me the whip.\n Fourth hit:  Adios, senor.\n\n\nAfter this, the targets remain down to expose the sinkhole.\nScoring is 5M for 1 target, 10M for 2, and 20M for a sweep of\nall 3.  Collecting the Idol is worth 20M, ends the Mode and\nlocks a ball for Multiball.\n\nIt is possible to collect the Idol while the targets still\nstand (ie a 'You Cheat' lock) but there is nothing special\nawarded for doing this.\n\nStreets of CairoShoot the ramps and orbits to search for Marion under\nboxes (she's under the one the monkey is screeching on) - 10M each\nif Marion is not underneath.  Finding Marion alters the display\nto show Indy being menaced by a sword wielding Arab type - score\nthe Mode saucer to have Indy shoot him for a 20M bonus. It is\nalso possible to blast the Arab by pulling the trigger on the\nplunger although that is only worth a paltry 2M points.  There\nis a total time for this mode, so the sooner you find Marion, the\nlonger you get to shoot the Arab, although you can rack up some\nserious points by deliberately shooting the boxes she is not\nunder (this has changed for L-6 where you can only collect each\nbox once).\n\nWell of SoulsHectic 6 ball Multi-Ball during which successive shots\nto the lock sinkhole are worth 2M x balls-in-play. Balls remain\nlocked in the sinkhole for a short time before getting thrown\nback into play.  After six shots into the sinkhole, the ENT\ntargets will start to reset for each hole scored making\nsubsequent shots a lot harder - it also helps if you start this\nMode with the drop targets down.\n\nAnimation is of Indy in a room full of snakes which he torches when\nyou hit the hole. This Mode lasts while there is more than one ball\nin play and thus there is no bonus for end of Mode.\n\nGet the Medallion: Video Mode in which the flippers aim Indy's gun\nleft and right to shoot bad guys in a the Raven Bar for 1M each\n(firing is automatic). An EB appears after enough bad guys have\nbeen toasted as does the Medallion (20 hits), shoot them to collect.\nThe round ends when you either collect the Medallion (for 15M bonus)\nor the baddies shoot you enough (a lot like Video Mode in T2).\nSecond  time  round  you  need  to  hit  25  baddies to  get  the\nMedallion to appear which  (I'm told)  is almost impossible.\nNote: In the animation, this is called the Raven Bar Video Mode.\n\n\nDuring the Modes a shot to the Start Mode saucer during a Mode is worth\na 1M Mode Bonus and the Captive Ball drop target is worth a 2M Mode Bonus.\nThe exceptions to this are Streets of Cairo (after finding Marion),\nCastle Grunewald and the VM Modes (Choose Wisely, Escape the Mine and\nRaven Bar/Medallion) when the ball is locked there.\nAs with Twilight Zone, the scores from these rounds are added to your\nbonus at the end of ball and can be pretty big.\n\nA neat thing about these is that it's not the pop bumpers which alter\nthe next lit one, but the ramps.  Therefore, a skilled player should\nbe able to select the mode he/she wants by shooting the appropriate\nnumber of ramps to light the required Mode and then collecting it.\n\nCompleting all 12 of the above lights Start Mode for:\nEternal Life MultiBall (Wizard award)\nCompletion of all 12 Modes awards the player with a 6 ball MultiBall.\nEternal Life is on for about 30 secs and balls are pumped out onto the\nplayfield.  Every switch (except the outlanes) are lit for 10M each.\nCollecting ALL switches including the PoA ones scores 1B and relights\nall the switches for another go.\n\nIt would appear that this feature is one of the buggiest on the game.\nSometimes it will give the animation for the 1B but not the points,\nand it will often leave the Path of Adventure playfield confused.\nCombination Shots\nThere are no (known) combination shots on Indiana Jones. I suspect this\nis due to multiple ramps/loops having other functions (ie Dogfight and\nFriends Jackpot)\nExtra Ball\nThis game is one of the most liberal when it comes to Extra Balls. Even\non 'hard' settings you can fairly easily get 5, and on most games they\nseem to be unlimited.  Also, all lit EB's are remembered between balls.\n\nThere are at least five ways of getting an EB from Indiana Jones:\n\n\n Light the Path of Adventure then shoot the right ramp to play\non the raised mini playfield. Steer the ball over the lit\nrollovers and as soon as the first set have been collected,\nthe second hole will be lit for an EB.  This means that it is\npossible to get an EB from the first pass of PoA, but in\npractice it is unlikely.\n\nFurther EB's are available every time you complete a set of\nrollovers after collecting The Pit.\n\n Light the four I-N-D-Y rollovers 4 times to increase bonus\nto 8X and light Extra Ball at the Start Mode saucer. Collect\nby shooting the saucer.\n\n Light the Hand of Fate from the inlanes. When collected at\nthe Start Mode hole it will sometimes light an EB. Shoot\nStart Mode again to collect it.\n\n Shoot Start Mode for Survive the Rope Bridge, cross the bridge\nand Extra Ball will be lit at the Mode saucer. Shoot Start\nMode to collect.\n\n Shoot Start Mode to start Raven Bar Video Mode. An Extra Ball\nis available after about enough bad guys have been blown away.\nShoot it to collect.\n\n\nNote: There are different Operator settings which allow different\nnumbers of available EB's. For example, some settings only allow\n1 EB to be collected using the first method above (INDY rollovers)\nwhereas in others this is unlimited.\nMulti-Ball\nMulti-Ball on Indiana Jones is somewhat reminiscent of that on\nFishTales.\n\n\nBriefly it's   Lite Locks - Lock 3 balls - Multi-ball: shoot left\nramp to light jackpot, right to collect it (repeat twice) - Super\nJackpot: Lit from left ramp, collected by hitting captive ball.\n\nLocking BallsShoot the E-N-T drop targets to open a path to the\nsinkhole and lite the Lock. Balls can be locked with none of\nthe targets down and gets you the quote \"You cheat, Mr Jones\"\nfrom Shorty and 5M.\n\nMulti-BallOnce 3 balls have been locked, you get an animation of our\nhero being chased by a huge rolling boulder and Multi-Ball\nstarts. The 3 balls are returned from the idol to the right\nflipper in fairly quick succession and Eternal Life is on\nfor a few seconds. Eternal Life is only on for the first\nMultiball though.\n\nJackpotsThere are three of them; The Ark, The Stones and The Grail\nwhich are worth a base of 20M, 30M & 40M respectively. This base\ncan be increased in one of two ways: First, there is 'raise\njackpot total'. Shooting Start Mode adds 2M to it, the Captive\nBall target adds 3M, the Captive ball adds 5M (10M if you\nreally nail it and hit the back switch)  and the Raise\nJackpot target adds something (anybody know how much?).\nSecond, shooting balls into the sinkhole will multiply the\n(base + raise jp) value: 1 ball gets you 2x and lights Jackpot if\nnot already lit, and 2 balls gets you 3x.\nBalls fired into the sinkhole remain in the Idol until one\nof the following occurs:\n\n\n You collect the Jackpot. Balls are released and Jackpot\nMultiplier is reset.\n You have no balls left active on the playfield. The next\nball is released from the Idol - Jackpot multiplier remains\nunchanged.\n 20 second timer expires. Balls are released and Jackpot\nMultiplier is reset.\n\n\nLighting the jackpot is done by successfully shooting the\nsinkhole or making the left ramp. Collecting jackpot is done by\nshooting the right ramp.\n\nSuper JackpotCollect all 3 Jackpots and Super Jackpot will be lit at\nthe Captive Ball.  There are 3 levels: 80M for the Arc, 90M\nfor the Stones and 100M for the Grail, each one being lit from\nthe left ramp. The raise jackpot total applies to these, but\nthey cannot be multiplied and each one after the third seems to\nbe worth around 105M-115M.\n\nIn short:\n\nJackpots are worth: (base + raise jackpot)*(balls in Idol + 1)\n\nSuper Jackpots are worth: base + raise jackpot\n\nJackpots will remain spotted until you have collected at least\nthe first Super Jackpot and that multiball ends. Then you start\nfrom the Ark Jackpot again on the next multiball.\n\nMulti-Ball restartThere ain't one ..... However, if you do drain two\nballs, the Jackpot remains lit until the timer expires (see\nnotes).  (But the Super Jackpot never remains lit and has _no_\ngrace period.)\n\nNotes:  There are some significant differences between P-x and L-x for\nMultiball:\n\n\n The ENT drop targets reset at the start of Multiball and every\ntime a ball gets sent to the Idol (2x & 3x multiplier) in L-x.\nThis behavior can be set in L-x with the Easy Multiball option.\n Super Jackpot values for P-x are 100M, 125M & 150M\n\n\nIf the Friends Jackpot is lit, the regular Jackpot will still be\ncollected by a shot to the right ramp (so will the Friends) but\nonly the animation for Friends jackpot will be displayed.\n\nMultiball cannot be started during Toem Multiball (quick 2-ball)\n\nStarting Multiball will suspend any Mode which is running which\nuses the Path of Adventure, but a nasty bug rears its head then.\n\nHints, Tips, Strategies\nThe first thing to note here is that the scoring, at least during the\nearly stages of a game, is well balanced. Most of the Modes have an\neffective limit of about 60M,  there are no excessive Jackpot shots\nlike the 1.2B Davros on DrWho and you have to work at getting good\npoints from Multi-Ball (unlike Dr*c!) by shooting the sinkhole and\ntargets which raise the jackpot value.\n\nAnother thing is that there are no redundant shots  - everything is\nuseful either directly or indirectly toward some major award.\nHowever, some shots are certainly more important than others; the Start\nMode hole for example is probably top of the list - if you can't hit it,\nyou can't play any of the special Mode rounds, you can't collect Hand\nof Fate or Extra Ball if lit among other things. I would probably put\nthe Lock sinkhole as second best shot to learn and then the ramps.\n\nGiven the above, it is therefor almost impossible to have a definitive\ngame plan. However, here are some ideas:\n\n\n Shoot the E-N-T targets followed by alternate ramps until\nDogfight is lit.  Shoot the sinkhole to collect Hurry Up\n(Dogfight) and lock ball 1.  Repeat for second ball, but take\nthe time to shoot Start Mode for Raven Bar VM when lit (to get\nan EB).  Same again for third ball then play Multi-Ball for\nJackpots.\n\n Shoot ramps to select required Mode and light Hand of Fate.\nShoot Start Mode to collect. Shoot sinkhole to collect any\nDogfights which are lit as a result of ramp shots.\n\n Shoot ADVENTURE targets to light Path of Adventure, shoot\nright ramp and play PoA, shoot right ramp and play PoA, shoot\nright ramp .... etc. (lots of points and at least 1 EB there).\nCollect The Pit when you feel like it.\n\n Concentrate on Multi-Ball.  This is probably the easiest way\nto score big points and the way most people will choose, but\nIMHO not the best and certainly not the most fun.\n\n If it's lit, shoot for it  ......\n(for people who can't make up their minds ... :)   )\n\n\nI expect that gameplan for most people will be largely determined by\nwhich shots they are best at.  There are certainly some good points to\nbe had from the Modes and some help toward EB's too so if you can hit\nthe saucer this would probably be the way to go. Alternately, if the\nright ramp is not a problem for you, Multiball is probably best.\n\nTo help you decide what to go for, the following is a rough guide to\nwhere the big points are:\n\n\nJackpot                   60M+ (with 3x multiplier)                                        \nSuper Jackpot             80M+                                                             \nThe Pit (PoA)             150M (upper limit)                                               \nLoop Jackpot              100M+                                                            \nDogfight                  40M  (upper limit)                                               \nModes                     35M+ (practical upper limit of 90M with an average of about 50M) \nEternal Life Multi-Ball   1B   (if all switches hit or 10M/switch)                         \n\n\nOne useful hint is to try to avoid starting any Multi-Ball while you\nhave Path of Adventure lit since this feature remains active and it is\npretty tuff trying to control the raised playfield and keep several\nballs in play at the same time.  The problem is not so much that balls\nup there are hard to control, but that once you have got one up there\nyou have to keep doing it or else PoA will time out and you will have\nwasted it.\n\nAnother useful tip regards saving balls from a right drain. As the ball\nrolls down the outlane, nudge the machine to the RIGHT which should\nknock the ball onto the outlane post (no matter how far open it is)\nfrom which it will rebound through the gate.  BTW - you are probably\nthinking I've lost the plot here, but I assure you it works for me - I\nprobably would not have included except somebody else mentioned it too.\n\nAny Multiball is useful when Super Pops are running.\n\nTry to start Multiball when Cross the Rope Bridge is going since, with\nall those balls flying around, it's apparently pretty tuff NOT to get\nthe EB lit.  Of course this could be related to some bugs which have\nbeen observed involving ramps during Multiball.\nBugs\nMore like 'Killer Cockroaches' than bugs .... :)\n\nI used to think the software on this game was pretty good. However,\nrecent Net traffic has shattered that illusion so I have now decided\nto give the software problems their own section...\n\nHardware problems with recent machines have already been noted by several\nfolks; the software, if anything, is worse! The bulk of these seem to\ninvolve the Path of Adventure playfield and its associated Modes.\nFortunately for the casual player, they will not be exposed to many of\nthem since they only pop up after the first Eternal Life Multiball.\n\nThe following are bugs known to me (in no particular order):\n\n\n Sometimes, the game will award you the Billion from Eternal Life\nMultiball but not actually give you the points!\n\n Escape in the Cart only awards 49M if you complete it when it\nshould be 55M (25 tunnels + 30M escape bonus). The Halfway\nBonus is awarded after only 10 tunnels too.\n\n In Multiball, The Ark is actually mis-spelled as 'arc'.\n\n Occasionally two of the winged lights which indicate progress\ntoward Dogfight will be flashing at once.  This usually happens\nafter Hand of Fate awards Start Dogfight.\n\n The monkey in Streets of Cairo will sometimes sit on the gap\nbetween two boxes and screech his head off.\n\n Shooting the left orbit in Streets of Cairo will often award\nboth of the boxes on the left of the four.\n\n Choose Wisely on level 3 is so slow the chalices only get\nswitched twice.\n\n Choose Wisely on level 4 causes a ball search which will often\ncost you the ball in play (it's kicked out of the saucer while\nthe flippers are dead).\n\n If you have collected The Pit already, Three Challenges will\nonly give you 5M (Mode Start bonus) coz the rollover switches\ndon't register.\n\n Hand of Fate will give certain awards when it should not (ie\n2 Ball awarded during Well of Souls!).  It then ignores these\nawards.\n\n In L-x software, if the Gun Trigger function has been set to\ncancel the Buy-In, it will only work sometimes, and never if\nthe last ball was Tilted (it simply clicks and doesn't cancel).\n\n The current Path Mode gets suspended when you start Multiball,\nbut during Multiball, shooting ramps still alters the selected\nMode.  Kevin Martin suffered this when he started Multiball\nduring Three Challenges and ended with Steal the Stones\nspotted!  (This bug applies to these two rounds only but can\ncost you a chance at any other round.)\n\nMisc. Stuff\nThese are the odds and ends I couldn't find a logical place for in the\nabove, or bits of interest:\n\n\nPlungerAutomatic variety in the shape of a six shooter. No skill shot!\n\nSound & Graphics The best sound I have heard in a Williams game so\nfar. The graphics also are, at least, comparable to Dracula\nand TZ.\n\nReplayNice animation of a whip being cracked and the appropriate\nsound effect which tends to drown out the traditional 'Thwack'.\t\t\n\nEB Buy-inExtra Ball buy-in is an optionally settable by the operator.\nWhen activated, you can buy a 'Super Ball' for 1 Credit.\nNote: Certain software upgrades on prototype cabinets cannot use\nEB buy-in since the software expects to find a dedicated\nbutton for this function. (software in beta's used the\ntrigger on the gun.  L-5 onwards has this fixed).\n\nSuper BallThis is the ball you just paid a whole credit for. Eternal\nLife is lit for about 20 secs, Path of Adventure is Lit, and\nthe next Mode is started.  Eternal Life Multiball does not count\nas a Mode for this (ie it won't start automatically if you have\nall 12 Modes spotted already).\n\nCowsFinally spotted one Wed 18th August 1993. It's in the Shoot Again\ndisplay when you start an extra ball. Six hiro .... heiro ....\nharo ..... hirogl ..... pictures are displayed as a background\nto Shoot Again - the top right one is a cow (well, looks like\nto me... :)\nNot on P-3 ROM's though.\n\nSaves I suspect Death Saves are possible, but then anybody who\ncan do them should be good enough to nudge the ball back\ninto the inlane through the gate. It's fairly easy to bounce\nthe ball away from the in/outlanes anyway.\n\nAvian BallsA hard hit on the drop target in front of the Captive Ball\nwill occasionally get the ball fired over the E-N-T targets!\nShooting the E-N-T targets will occasionally shoot the ball\nover the left slingshot with about a 50/50 chance of it landing\neither on a habitrail or in the outlane (more common from a left\nflipper shot). On later software (P-4+) you will get the ball\nback the when this happens.\n\nFunI spotted this in r.g.p. for Louis Koziarz who noticed\nthat after a power cycle, pressing the flippers will get a\nrandom sound effect which is sometimes a loud BUUURRRRRPPPPP!\n(from Monkey Brains). This only appears on P-4 ROMs though.\nThis also happens after a power cycle and then pressing Start.\nNo longer happening at full volume in L-6, but the sound FX\nstill occur if you press the buttons.\n\nCreditsThe following have contributed to the above in some way or\nanother:\n\n\nJoel Iott\t        Jonathan Deitch \nCameron Silver\t        David Stewart   \nSteve Baumgarten        Mark Phaedrus   \nBowen Kerins\t        Kevin Martin    \n\n\nand, in fact, most of the r.g.p. regulars .... Thanx .. :)\n\n\n---------------------------- The End ----------------------------\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Indiana Jones the Pinball Adventure", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronic Games Inc.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/indianajones.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Indiana Jones", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Like The Shadow, it took me a while to get\ninto it, but now that I have some idea of what I'm doing with the game, it's\nbecoming a joy to play.\n\nThe sound is great. Now I don't just mean that the sound is of exceptional\nquality, but it's a nice game to listen to. The music and little tunes are\ncool, as are the three main voices that help you along the way. Oh yea, there\nis also one mother of a \"mooooo\"!!\n\nThe three characters in the game are Bobby, Paul and the announcer. Paul and\nBobby are TV commentators, while Tom Carnegie (the announcer) is a legend at\nthe Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and has been for 50 years! He has a great\nvoice ... One of the things I love about this game is they way he announces\nthe modes: Dueling Drivers, and Super Light-Ups.\n\nThanks to Dan Farris for that little bit Indy Trivia!\n\nThe other two converse nicely about this and that. I'm a big fan of dialogue\nexchanges like this, and it's very appropriate to the theme, as the two\napparently sound just like this while commentating:\n\n\"Driver 1 has a ball in the Turbo, Bobby\"\n\"That's right Paul, another one means a guaranteed multiball.\"\n\nThis game is also the first (to my knowledge) to feature light up targets.\nA light up target is a square plastic target (a little larger then one of\nthe RIVER targets in White Water, or the REPAIR targets in Dr Who) that is\ndivided into four quadrants. Each quadrant can light up. Hit the target 4\ntimes to complete it, and unlight it. In Indy 500, a really cool sound is\nheard on completion of a target.\n\nOverall I like this game. Dennis Nordman has done a great job of taking a\nrelatively non-humorous theme, and creating a good, fun game full of little\nsurprises and jokes. This was one of the things that I loved about White Water.\n\nOh and by the way, this game has no sink-holes and lots of targets!\n\nDesigner Names\n\nIndy 500 was made possible by:\n\nDennis Nordman, Mike Boon, Craig Sylla, Dan Hughes, Win Schilling, Armande\nZuniga, Chris Granner, Adam Rhine, Brian Morris, Paul Barker, Butch Ortega,\n\nThanks to: Kevin Davey, Mark Weyna\n\nThe Playfield\n\nIndy 500 is in a standard width cabinet, that contains 4 balls.\n\nNote: I have been told that a 'Spanner' is not a common term in some parts\nof the world, and that the term 'Wrench' is better understood. Personally,\nI think the two are completely different tools.\n\nDescription\n\nIn describing the playfield, I'll use the standard r.g.p method of starting\nat the bottom, and rotating in a clockwise direction. Just remember that the\nplayfield has a lot of stuff on it, and it's not all that easy to describe,\nespecially around the jets.\n\n\nPlungerAutoplunger that sends the ball up a short ramp to a wire-form, that\nfeeds balls to the right inlane. Very much like Theatre of Magic.\n\nLower FlippersStandard white flippers.\n\nSlingshotsStandard slingshots, just a little smaller.\n\nIn/Out lanesA letter in the word \"INDY\" appears at the top of each lane.\nRolling through an unlit lane will light the letter, use the flippers to\nchange lit lanes. Complete INDY to light Souvenir on the left ramp if not\nalready lit. There is no kickback.  One thing, if you collected all\nsouvenirs, this is useless (you can't collect them again)...It will still\nsay souvenir is lit, don't worry about it.\n\nHit The Wall targetsThree orange targets sitting above the left inlane.\nComplete them to light Hit The Wall on the right orbit.\n\nLeft OrbitStandard orbit that goes around the back of the playfield. Balls\nshot here come out the entrance to the Right Orbit past the upper flipper.\nIt is very much like the left orbit on The Shadow. This is the Orange Car,\nand can light lock, the Speedway, and award a Pass. Each of these things\nare described in more detail later on in the Rules.\n\nBlue TargetA solitary blue stand-up target on the left of the entrance to\nthe Left Ramp. Use this target to light Change Setup in the Right Orbit.\nYou will need to hit the blue target ~5-6 times before it will lit.\n\nLeft RampA plastic ramp that drops the ball at the upper right flipper. This\nramp could almost be described as steep. Failed shots sometimes scream down\nthe middle, but are usually savable on a leveled machine. This is the\nYellow Car, awards Jackpot and Souvenir, and can be lit to Increase Boost.\n\nIf nothing is lit for left ramp and you went through it, it will award\nyou 2 laps.  It will say \"Turn 2, 2 Laps.\"  This is tripled during\ntriple scoring playfield.\n\nSpanner TargetOne of the four Spanner Targets in this game. It's a square\nyellow target on the right of the Left Ramp, but facing the lower right\nflipper. See the section on the Spanner Targets for more information.\n\nTurbo Lock popperThis is the way to lock balls, situated behind the first\nSpanner Target it is shootable from the upper flipper. Balls land in the\npopper that pops them into the lock. Think of the reel in Fish Tales, now\npush it over so it is lying down, now modify it to hold four balls; thats\nabout how the Turbo Lock looks. It's not easy to get the full effect of\nthis thing in words, so I guess you'll just have to wait and see it... ;-)\nThis ejects balls to the right inlane, but they often fly right off the\nwire-form ramp - sometimes over the flippers right into the trough ... it's\nso perfect that it's actually impressive!\n\nSpanner TargetThe second of the four Spanner Targets in this game. It's a\nsquare yellow target just above the Turbo Lock popper. It is shootable from\nthe upper or lower right flippers. See the section on the Spanner Targets\nfor more information.\n\nLight-Up TargetOne of three light-up targets in this game, sits sort-of\nnext to the second Spanner Target (in a similar position as the Neutral\nZone in Star Trek). It is shootable from the lower right flipper. See the\nsection on the Light-Up Targets for more information.\n\nCenter HoleThis is standard saucer next to the Light-Up target, but don't\nworry there is a one-way gate, and the playfield has been cut in a way\nthat stops most balls from bouncing out. Balls exit this hole to the right,\nand go into the jets. The Center Hole can be lit for Start Race (I have no\nidea what this does, or how to light it), Extra Ball, and Victory Lap. This\nalso sometimes starts a mode, although I'm not 100% sure of the semantics\nof it yet.  He meant was \"Start Race\" was \"Green Flag\" and you can\nstart modes there as well. I'm thinking that it will relight when mode\nends.  It will always be light when you start your ball from the launcher\nexcept ball locks.\n\nPIT RolloversThree rollover lanes to the right of the Center Hole, in a\nsimilar position as the ones in Star Trek:TNG and Theatre of Magic.\nCompleting PIT increases the Bonus Multiplier to a max of 8x, and lights\nPit Stop on the Right Ramp if not already lit. The only way to shoot the\nrollover lanes is via the Center Hole.  First time you complete, it will\nlight pit stop, 2nd time and later, it will increases the BM.  There will be\nNO Bonus Held.\n\nJet BumpersThree bumpers arranged in the triangle formation we all know and\nlove. These are below the PIT rollovers and are only accessible by shooting\nthe Center Hole. The bumpers have very cool tops, and contain flashers not\nnormal globes. Balls exit the bumpers to the Right Orbit.\n\nSpanner TargetThe third of the four spanner Targets in this game. It's a\nsquare yallow target that sits just to the right of the entrance to the\nCenter Hole, in a similar position as Start Mission in Star Trek. It is\nshootable from the left flipper. See the section on Spanner Targets for\nmore information.\n\nLeft JetThe left Bumper pokes through just below the Spanner Target, much\nlike Demo Man. Just thought I'd mention it..\n\nHelper HoleA small hole that is not shootable by any flipper, balls just\nfall into it. Balls get shot out of here straight into the Center Hole. This\nawards Change Setup when lit (although there is no light near it, it seems\nto award Change Setup when the light on the Right Orbit is lit.)\n\nLight-Up TargetsTwo of the three Light-Up Targets in this game, sit in a\nsimilar position as the Bigfoot Hotfoot targets in White Water. They are\nsort of below the Helper Hole. See the section on Light-Up Targets for more\ninformation.\n\nRight RampCalled the Speed Ramp, it's a plastic ramp that feeds the ball to\nthe left inlane. It is not really steep, but the peak is at the back of the\nmachine, so you need to hit it well. It's very much like the right ramp on\nIndiana Jones, but not as high. This is the Blue Car, and can award Jackpot,\nand/or Fast Laps, as well as the Pit Stop. This ramp also counts up to\nthings like Extra Balls, for more information see the section Speed Ramp.\n\nIf you shoot up the right ramp during ~5-10 seconds after ball launched,\nthen \"Go for the Pole\" mode will be active.  I'm not sure if you only\ndo this once per game.\n\nRight OrbitStandard orbit that goes around the back of the playfield. Balls\nshot up here should end up in a popper at the back left of the playfield.\nI found that soft shots, or exceptionally strong ones would either dribble\nout the Left Orbit, or back out the Right. The popper pops balls onto the\nRight Ramp, which feeds them back to the left inlane. A Right Orbit is only\nawarded if the ball makes it into the popper. The right orbit can award\nChange Setup, Speedway, and/or Hit The Wall, it is also the Green Car.\n\nUpper Right FlipperA standard flipper that sits at the entrance to the Right\nOrbit (very much like The Shadow). This flipper is good for shooting the\nLock, as well as the second Spanner Target. Balls can be feed to this\nflipper in one of three ways:\n\n The left ramp\n The Center Hole, which kicks to the Jets\n The Left Orbit\n\n\nSpanner TargetThe fourth of the four Spanner Targets in this game. It's a\nsquare yellow target that sits under the upper flipper, opposite the Hit\nThe Wall targets.\n\nRace CarSitting above the playfield in the back right corner, is a round\nrace track. Shooting the Right Ramp causes an Indy Car to go hooning around\nthe track. The whole machine starts shaking .. it's very cool. Similar\nto RS on the bulldozer.\n\n\nCar Shots\n\nFour shoots in the game are Car Shots. They are used in various modes:\n\n\n Left Orbit: Orange Car\n Left Ramp: Yellow Car\n Right Ramp: Blue Car\n Right Orbit: Green Car\n\n\nRules\n\nThe Speedways\n\nModes in Indy 500 are called Speedways. There are 10 modes, and an 11th which\nmust be started last. You can start modes while others are running, that is,\nthey run concurrently; and continue to run during Multiball.\n\nModes are started by shooting the Right Orbit when Award Speedway is lit, the\nball must land in the popper for the mode to begin. Shoot the Left Orbit\n(Light Speedway) to relight Award Speedway. The totals for each mode are\nadded in the end of ball bonus.\n\nNote: The Center Hole also sometimes starts modes, but I'm not 100% sure\nof the semantics of that yet. Well... it will always be lit to start mode\nevery time when you launched the ball (except Ball locks) or when other\nmodes have ended (that I'm not sure).\n\nThe modes are displayed in the middle of the playfield. Lit ones have been\nplayed, unlit ones haven't and the flashing one will be played next. The\nflashing mode only appears if Award Speedway is lit, and it seems that the\nonly way to change the flashing mode is with Advance Speedway from the Right\nRamp; see the section on Speed Ramp for more information.  You can start\na mode when you land the ball in the center popper and the Green Flag has\nlighted.  Usually, it will be on in ball you start.\n\nThe modes are:\n\n\nWrong TurnA driver takes a wrong turn and ends up taking the Indy Car\nonto the streets. Great Animations.  This is a 30 second mode where each\nswitch awards 250,000. Shoot any hole to raise the value by 250,000.\nFor every hole, one of three things happens:\n\n The Indy Car pulls over next to a farmer (with cow). The farmer\nannounces, in a typical farmer voice: \"You go about half a mile past\nthe barn, and take a left!\".\n The Indy Car hoons through the drive through of a Very Fast Food\nstore (get it?), and the driver screams: \"Don't forget the fries!\"\n The Indy Car is stuck in traffic, and you guessed it: \"Move your\ncar!\"\n\n\n\nQuick PitThe ball is locked, and Pit Stop begins. See the section on\nPit Stop for more information. Note, it is not possible to re-light\nthe Speedway during Pit Stop.\n\nGo For The PoleYou have 20 seconds to spell Pole. Shoot the Right Ramp\nto get the next letter, it's worth 5, 10, 15, 20 Million. This does not\neffect your Position. Note, you still have to play this, even if you\nhave started it off the Right Ramp at the start of a ball.\n\nIf you got this mode by shooting the right ramp, Green Flag is lit, and\nthis mode is running, you will be awarded the Green Flag award (see\nmultiball for how much).  You only get this once, 2nd and subsequent times\nyou will just boost the jackpot up by 2 million till you maxed out (see\njackpot for max amount).\n\n[1] in Easy mode, you have 30 seconds.\n\nDueling DriversI like starting this, just to hear the Announcer say it!\nYou have 30 seconds to pass the car in front. Shoot all four Car Shots\nto pass. It is worth 5, 10, 15, 20 Million.\n\nLight Extra BallLights Extra Ball at the Center Hole.\n\nThis is stackable by other ways and methods.\n\nGasoline AlleyA 30 second mode where you must try and open 5 doors to\nget the goodies behind them. The Right Orbit opens the next door (the\nball must go into the Popper). Behind the doors are:\n\n\n 10 Laps [Also awards 5 million]\n 10 Million\n Pass 15 cars  [Also awards 15 million]\n 20 Million\n 25 Million\n\n\nNote that the Laps are tripled if Triple Scoring is active, although the\ndisplay doesn't indicate this.\n\nCautionThis is the video mode, and I quite like it. Move the car left\nand right with the flippers (like Getaway). Avoid obstacles, and collect\npoint values (1, 2, 5, 10 Million); as well as the Extra Ball. Avoid 30\nobstacles to finish. Hit an obstacle and you crash, but if you just skim\nan obstacle you only skid a bit. Look for the Doho in the skid/crash\nanimation.\n\n3x PlayfieldAnother great one to start to hear Mr Announcer say \"Triple\nPlayfield Scoring!\". Not only does this triple all scores (including\nMultiball jackpots), but it also triples the number of Laps each shot\nawards. It lasts for 30 seconds.\n\nTurbo BoostTwo ball multiball. The jackpot value starts at 10 million,\ncollect it by shooting the Turbo Lock. Shoot the Left Ramp, (Increase\nBoost) to raise the jackpot by 10 Million; it maxes at 90 Million. Note\nthat the value slowly creeps back down to 10 Million, so you have to keep\nhitting the left ramp to keep it up there. It is not possible to relight\nthe Speedway during this mode.\n\nSuper Lite-UpsThis seemed to have absolutely no effect. There were no\ntimers, and the Light-Up Targets continued to score as they do in normal\nplay. But you do get to hear the announcer say \"Super light-Ups!\".\n\nSuper JetsMake 30 hits, to get 30 million. Ends after the 30 hits, or\nwhen the ball drains.  Your settings will vary.  For some, it won't\nend until game is completely over so you still have a chance to get\n30 million. Can be concurrent with secret mode (rarely).\n\nCheckered FlagOnly available when the other 10 have at least started.\nAll this does is light Victory Lap in the Center Hole.\nSecret ModeSee [Easter Eggs].  Only selectable if ball is in\ncenter hole when green Flag is lit.\n\n\nSpanner Targets\n\nScattered around the playfield are 4 Spanner Targets. At the start of the game\nthey flash, and once hit they remain solidly lit. Complete all four to make\nthem flash again. The first hit (when flashing) is worth 500,000, otherwise\nthey are worth 250,000. Completing them is worth 2 million.\n\nYour settings would vary.  Mostly, it is 4 million, then the value goes up\nby 2 million every time you spell out the 4 letter words below.\n\nThis process continues during all multiballs.\n\nThese are very weird targets in that completing them seems to have no effect\nother then spelling a four letter word. The words are:\n\nINDY, RACE, CARS, FAST, LAPS, TIRE, FUEL, DOHO, OVAL, GEAR,\nWING, SPIN, WOOF, MILK, PASS, TURN, SKID, WALL, COWS\n\nAfter COWS, it starts again with INDY.\n\nSouvenirs\n\nThe instruction cards states:\n\nCollect the Indy souvenirs, and discover the secrets that each unlocks.\n\nCollect a souvenir by shooting the Left Ramp when lit. Light SOUVENIR by\ncompleting INDY (the in/out lanes). Souvenir remains lit between balls, this\nwhole process also continues during all multiballs. It is not possible to\nlight Souvenir if it's already lit, so it is a bit of a waste to complete\nINDY while Souvenir is lit.\n\n\nSouvenirPoints for gettingUse\nT-Shirt            5  million         Light-Up targets \nToy Indy Car       10 million         Light-Up targets \nTeddy Bear         15 million         Light-Up targets \nBaseball Cap       20 million         ??               \nIndy Trophy        25 million         ??               \nMug                30 million         Light-Up targets \nKey Ring           35 million         ??               \nFrisbee            40 million         Light-Up targets \nVideo Tape         45 million         ??               \nRace Cow           50 million         Light-Up targets \n\n\nIt's worth getting the cow, just to hear the mooo...\n\nAfter you collect all the souvenirs, that is it.  You can't add anymore.\nIt won't be like RS when you can do it again..wrong...\n\nLight-Up Targets\n\nThere are three light up targets in this game. One is just to the left of the\nCenter Hole, the other two are next to each other below the jets.\n\nThe targets work in waves. Completing all three targets completes a wave.\nCompleting a target involves hitting it four times. The number of remaining\nhits of a target is easily detectable by the number of flashing lights on\nthat target. Complete targets remain complete until the end of the wave.\n\nTarget values:\n\nPer hit:       X Million - Where X is the current wave number\n\nOn Completion: 5 Million\n\nThe Souvenirs help complete waves. If you have the right souvenir for a\nparticular wave, then each target only needs one hit to complete it, instead\nof four.\n\n\nWaveAwardsSouvenir\n1      15 million                           T-Shirt             \n2      20 million                           Teddy Bear          \n3      25 million                           Mug                 \n4      30 million and lights Extra Ball     Frisbee             \n5      35 million                          \n6      35 million and lights victory lap    Cow                 \n7      35 million                          \n8      35 million                           Toy Car/Key Ring    \n9+     35 million                          \n\n\nNote - The extra ball may reflex to other waves.\n\n\n I tried this with all souvenirs, I don't know why waves 5 and 7 can't\nbe helped. Meybe there is something else in the game that helps them.\n I couldn't work out whether or not the graphic for wave 8 was the Toy\nCar or the Key Ring.\n I tried right up to wave 13, and no more souvenirs, or awards seemed\nto show up.\n\n\nThis process continues during all multiballs.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nShoot the left ramp after plunging any ball for the skill shot award. The\nfirst award is 5 million, and making the shot increases it by 1 million.\nThe maximum skill shot award is 15 million.\n\nThis is not mentioned anywhere in the game, but shooting the right ramp early\nin the ball (possibly within the first 10 or 20 seconds) will start the Go\nFor The Pole mode. Note: this does NOT spot the Speedway Light, so you must\nstill start this mode from the back popper for the machine to consider it\nplayed.\n\nMultiball\n\n\n Before I go on...there are only 3 multiball types.  Regular, Pit, and\nTurbo.  NO Big Multiballs, Major endings, etc.  The only major ending is\nthe victory lap. That's it.\n\n During Pit Mode and/or other multiball, if the Green Flag is lit, and\nyou land in the center hole, you will be awarded the Green Flag Awarded\nwhich starts at 6 Million and it increases by 1 million.\n\n\nExamples of Big Multiball\n\n Cirqus Voltaire - Party M (1997)\n NBA Fastbreak - Trophy M (1996)\n Junk Yard - Outer Space (1995)\n\n\nStarting:\n\n Shoot the Left Orbit to light lock. For the first multiball, one shot\nwill light lock 1 and 2. For the second multiball, the Left Orbit must\nbe shot twice (once for each lock). For the third multiball, the Left\nOrbit must be shot twice to light each lock. I'm assuming that it\ncontinues to get harder.\n\n[1] In easy mode, you need to shoot the loop 3 times for the\nfor 3rd and subsequent multiballs.\n\n Lock balls in the Turbo Lock. It's actually a good shot because the\nLeft Orbit (light lock) feeds the upper flipper, so you can then hammer\nthe ball into the lock. In fact, this is a combo, worth 10 million the\nfirst time, and increases by 2 million. The max is 30 million.\n\n After locking the second ball, multiball begins. It's three ball\nmultiball, so the third is autolaunched.\n\n Lock quotes:\n\nLock 1: Driver 1 has a ball in the Turbo bobby.\nThat's right Paul, another one means a guaranteed multiball.\n\nLock 2: Woow! There's the second lock.\nWe're ready for multiball ... and here we go!\n\n Balls are ejected from the lock to the right flipper.\n\n Since the game has an autoplunger, it is not possible to steal other\nplayers locked balls. The good thing is that in multiplayer games,\nthe autoplunged balls return to the right flipper as well.\n\n\nJackpots:\n\n\n The base jackpot value is 20 million. Shoot the Turbo Lock in normal\nplay, when lock isn't lit, to add 2 million to the base, to a max of\n50 Million.  You can also go to the center popper (when green flag\nlight is not on) and it will do the same as well.  Settings may very,\nfor the machine in my area, the base is 30 million.\n\n At the start of multiball, Jackpot is lit on both ramps. After both\nramps have been hit, the jackpot alternates. Listen for the audio cues\nas to which ramp to hit.\n\n Collecting a jackpot raises the value by 2 million.\n\n Lock a ball during multiball to raise the value by 10 million. After\nabout 20 seconds, this ball will be unlocked, and the jackpot will\nreturn to the base value (ie: the value it was at the start of\nmultiball).\n\n Lock a second ball during multiball (ie: while one ball is already\nlocked), to raise the jackpot by a further 10 million. If only two balls\nare in play, then a third will be launched.  Both balls will be kicked\nout after about 20 seconds, and the jackpot will return to the base\nvalue (ie: what it was at the start of multiball).\n\n Lock a third ball during multiball (ie: while two balls are already\nlocked), to collect the Super Jackpot worth 60 Million.\n\n After the first Super Jackpot, locking the third ball simply raises the\njackpot by a further 10 million, but a fourth ball will be launched into\nplay. Lock this ball to collect the Super Jackpot.\n\n If, during multiball, there is only one ball in play while all others\nare locked, and that ball drains, then all locked balls are released.\n\n Multiball ends when less then two balls remain in play, and the lock is\nempty.\n\n[1] In easy mode, if you made the ball into turbo lock at least one\ntime and later ball(s) drains, but one, the multiball is still active, you\njust play with a monoball till you collect the super jackpot..you can\nstill make jackpots through the ramps.  This is similar to Levels 1-3 in\nCV (when you completed all 9 marvels).\n\n\nHit The Wall\n\nNo, this is not a version of the Pizza Hut ads, \"Hit the Hut tonight\"!\n\nComplete the Hit The Wall targets to light Hit The Wall on the Right Orbit.\nThe ball must land in the popper to get this award, even though the animation\nis triggered by the orbit roll-over switch. The first time this is worth 5\nmillion, the second time 7 million, third time 9 million etc.\n\nThis continues during all multiballs.\n\nWhen you do a buy-in, the award is set..won't go any higher so if you\nscored 7 million before the buy-in, then it will stay at 7 million.\n\nChange Setup\n\nLight Change Setup by hitting the Blue Target. The first time only one hit\nis necessary, but after each Change Setup, the number of hits needed increases\nby one. The display tells you how many hits remain to light it.\n\nWhen lit, collect Change Setup on the Right Orbit (the ball must go into the\npopper). It's a 'choose your own award' award, but, you only have 5 seconds\nto find what you want, and there's no turning back.\n\nBesides measly amounts of points, awards can include:\n\n\n  10 Million\n  15 Million\n  20 Million\n  Light Extra Ball\n  10 laps\n  Light Change Setup\n  Light Lock\n  Spot PIT lane\n  Pass a number of cars\n  1 Million\n  3 Million\n  5 Laps\n\n\nYou see number of points, they are worth nothing.\n\nBuy-in Rules\n\nAfter your 3rd ball or when you have used up your extra balls you have\nthe option of continuing the game.  The default setting is you can only\ndo up to 3 buy-ins.  Your settings may very.  In some cases, there are\nunlimited buy-ins (not sure if easy mode will do this).  When you buy-in,\nyou have a 20 sec. ball saver.  In extra balls during buy-in, it is only 1-3\nsec. ball saver after the ball is launched.\n\nCaution on Scoring\n\nI believe that in some pinball machines, the maximum score is\n9,999,999,999 in short which is 9.99 billion.  If you go over that\namount, it will rollover to the value of zero (0) and all this time you\nracked-up big stuff will be lost.  so be careful....so this Pinball game,\nyou cannot go over 9.99 billion.  e-mail me if you disagree with this or\nsetting is different.\n\nIn AFM, I believe the max is 99.99 billion...(I'm not sure).\n\nPit Stop Multiball\n\nStarting:\n\n\n Complete the PIT rollover lanes to light Pit Stop on the Right Ramp.\n\n Shoot the Right Ramp, and the ball will be locked at a cool little\ndiverter-lock on the left side of the machine.\n\n If Pit Stop is started by the Quick Pit Speedway, the ball is popped\nfrom the popper at the back of the machine, and locked in the diverter\nlock. The rest of the mode functions the same.\n\n A second ball is autolaunched, and you have 25 seconds to shoot the\nRight Ramp to exit the pit. The taunting quotes are great.\n\"Today.. today.. today..\"\n\n The machine keeps track of the person who exited the pit the quickest.\nSince our machine doesn't do this, I can't say what the default is, but\nrecords have been seen at 1.7 and 1.4 seconds.\n\n When you shoot the Right Ramp, or the 25 seconds time out, the locked\nball will be released, and two-ball multiball begins.\n\n If you drain before releasing the locked ball, it will be released, and\nnormal play resumes.\n\n\nJackpots:\n\n\n Depending on how quickly you unlock the second ball, 1-4 cars will be\nlit for 10 million jackpot. It may be increased by 2 million.\n\n\n Cars Lit  Pit Time: \n Orange  Yellow  Blue  Green \n   yes     yes     yes    yes       Under 12 seconds               \n   yes     no      yes    yes       Between 12 and 17 seconds      \n   yes     no      yes    no        Between 17 seconds and timeout \n   yes     no      no     no        Pit timeout                    \n\n\n Each car can only be shot once, but when all have been collected, they\nre-light.\n\n Pit Stop multiball ends when less then two balls remain in play.\n\n\nPositions\n\nAt the start of the game, you are in position 28. Shoot the Left Orbit when\nPass is lit to move up a position. Every Left Orbit shot lights Pass for a\nwhile, and I think the right inlane does too. The current position alternates\nwith the Credits/Balls display at the bottom of the screen.\n\n[1] In easy mode, you'll start in position 23, 2 laps (2 laps has already\nbeen given to you at the start of the game).\n\nThis continues during all multiballs.\n\nWhen you reach Position 1, Victory Lap lights at the Center Hole.\n\nLight Speedway, light lock and Pass light may not lit together at the same\ntime.\n\nSpeed Ramp\n\nThe Right Ramp is called the Speed Ramp. Each shot increments a counter, and\nat certain numbers of ramps, you get an award.\n\n\nRamp Number:  Award: \n    2         Advance Speedway               \n    3         Advance Speedway               \n    8         Extra Ball lit (See note below)\n   10         Advance Speedway               \n   15         Advance Speedway               \n   17         Advance Speedway               \n   18         Advance Speedway               \n   20         Advance Speedway               \n   22         Advance Speedway               \n   24         Advance Speedway               \n   28         Advance Speedway               \n   35         Advance Speedway               \n   45         Advance Speedway               \n   50         Extra Ball Lit                 \n   60         Advance Speedway               \n   70         Advance Speedway               \n\n\n\n Advance Speedway simply changes what the next lit Mode is.\n I stopped testing at 70 ramps, and assume that Advance Speedway continues\nto occur at every 10 ramps.\n Speed Ramp 8 is the default starting position for Light Extra Ball, but\nit reflexes from there depending on the percentage of extra balls the\nmachine has awarded.\n\n\nAny shot to this ramp will light the Fast Laps light for a while. Shooting\nthe ramp while Fast Laps is lit, will award two laps (tripled to 6 if Triple\nPlayfield Scoring is active).\n\nAll of this continues during all multiballs.\n\nLaps\n\nAt the start of the game, you have made no laps. Various shots increase the\nnumber of laps:\n\n\n  Left Orbit:     1 lap        \n  Left Ramp:      2 laps       \n  Center Hole:    1 lap        \n  Helper Hole:    1 lap        \n  Right Ramp:     1 lap        \n  Fast Laps:      2 laps       \n  Right Orbit:    1 lap        \n  Start a mode:   5 laps       \n  Gasoline Alley: 10 Laps      \n  Change SetUp:   5 or 10 Laps \n\n\nWhenever a single lap is awarded, a slight 'ping' sound is heard. So for a\nshot that awards 5 laps, 5 pings will be played. The number of laps is\nperiodically announced during the game: \"That's one hundred and twenty five\nlaps for driver 1.\" This continues during all multiballs.\n\nNote that the number of laps awards for the above, are indeed tripled by the\nTriple Playfield Scoring mode.\n\nThe Graphs and Victory Lap\n\nOccasionally during the game, you'll see 4 bar graphs show up. This indicates\nyour progress towards lighting Victory Lap.\n\nVicotry Lap can be lit by:\n\n\n Light-Ups: Wave 6\n Speedway: Getting the Checkered Flag\n Laps: After 200 laps.\n Position: When you reach position 1.\n\n\nVictory Lap is worth 100 or 200 million (depends on the ROM version), but\nit's stackable (at least, the 100 Million one is). So if you light Victory\nLap more then once and then shoot it, you'll receive it all.\n\nIf it is stackable and you complete any of the above. If you get 2 items\nbefore collecting victory lap, you will be awarded 500 million.\n\nI hope this can't be tripled.\n\nAfter you get 200 laps, you will go back to the start (0 laps).\nWhen you are in position 1, you'll stay there for the rest of the game.\n\nBonus\n\nIncrease the bonus multiplier by completing the PIT rollover lanes, to a\nMaximum of 8x.\n\nBonus is made up of:\n\n10,000 x laps\n+  (50,000 x (27-position)) + 200,000\n*  Multiplier\n+  Modes\n=  Total Bonus\n\nIt is NOT possible to speed up the bonus count, but it's pretty quick anyway.\n\nEaster Eggs\n\n\n Cows: The last souvenir.\nIn the farmer animation of Wrong Turn.\nSpelt with the Spanner Targets.\n\n  Pit Cow: It occasionally pops up on the PIT STOP.  It shows a cow in\nthe pits being refueled/milked.  There is also a way to make it appear\nintentionally, if you have the patience.\n\n Using the right ramp, advance the speedway light to QUICK PIT\n(If it's already there, go to step 2)\n Make sure the AWARD SPEEDWAY light is lit on the right\nloop/orbit.  If not, use the left loop/orbit to light it.\n Shoot the right loop/orbit to light it.\n\nAs the award animation begins (car streaking across screen, text\ndescribing award), hit the LAUNCH button ~4-5 times.  There..you should\nsee PIT COW.\n\n DOHO: Spelt with the Spanner Targets.\n\n DOHO also appears briefly in the skid/crash animation of the video mode.\n\n Secret Mode: Many times I have started a secret mode at the Center Hole,\nwhen Start Race was lit. (Remember that I have no idea what Start Race\ndoes, or how to light it...) The mode just told me that \"Jets Give Neat\nStuff\". It didn't lie either. Each jet improved it's own aspect of the\ngame. The mode ended when the ball left the jets.  This mode only\navailable when the ball is in the center hole and Green Flag is lit.\n\nIn this one there are three things...each hit will do one of the\nfollowing:\n\n Improve your position (until you reach position 1)\n Add the number of laps\n 5 Million\n\nI don't think this mode is started by some button combination, as I've\nseen quite a few people play it. This is part of the mode as well..\n\n I still can't figure out what Pole we're supposed to go for .. I mean,\nNorth or South? ;-)\n\n\nEnd Of Rule Sheet\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Indianapolis 500", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/indianapolis500.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Indianapolis 500", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

(Of course, if you insist on mailing corrections to\nphaedrus@halcyon.com so they can be included in the next release, I\ndon't suppose I can stop you.)\nCredits\nThis version was written by me, Mark Phaedrus.  Nobody else was any help\nat all.  Scientists have speculated that this may be because this is the\nfirst version and nobody else knew about it.  Further research is\nneeded.\nRecent Changes\n10/17/95: In the beginning the document was void and without content.\nAnd the Writer said \"Let there be text.\"  And there was, and it was\ngood, or at least passable. \n10/21/95: Tried a revolutionary new technique; brought pencil and paper\nto the arcade, and wrote things down.  (I find that kneeling down and\nwriting things on a paper on the floor during Casino Run adds an extra\nelement of tension to the game.)  Revised the Keno card rules, the MK3\nHint and More Time awards during Casino Run, the Multiball Jack*bot\nvalues, the Poker awards, and the bonus count rules.  Added more bugs;\nadded Neat Stuff section.\nSummary\nThe object is Jack*Bot is to score points.  Simple as that.  Next\nsection. \nWell, okay, there are a few more things that can go here.  There are\ntwo key ways to rack up points.  You can do it the slow-and-methodical\nway, by opening the visor, starting Multiball, and racking up the\njackpots--er, Jack*bots.  Or you can do it the quick-and-adventurous\nway, by playing the four casino games, preferably cheating on as many\nas possible, then playing the Casino Run for big points (or no points,\nas the case may be).  Personally, my advice is \"all of the above\".\nPlayfield\nIf you've played Pinbot, you'll know your way around this playfield;\nit's almost exactly the same as the original Pinbot playfield--it's\nthe rules that stir things up.  As usual, we'll start from the lower\nright and work our way around clockwise.  It may help to look at the\n\nplayfield picture on the Pinball Archive at pinball.cc.cmu.edu.\n\nPlunger\n\nAn old-fashioned manual plunger.  Balls shot up the\nramp can wind up here.  Leads to the\nVortex.\n\nHit Me\n\nA touch target just above the right inlane/outlane area; shoot it\nfrom the tip of the left flipper, or hit it with a lucky bounce\noff the slingshots.  Each hit of this target deals a card into your\nblackjack hand (don't confuse these with the cards in your\npoker hand).  Normal blackjack rules apply\n(face cards count as ten, Aces count as one or eleven, etc.).\nHit Me hits score 1M for each point in your blackjack hand; for\nexample, if you already have an Ace in your hand (11 points), and\nyou shoot Hit Me and get dealt a six (bringing your hand to 17 points),\nyou get 17M.  If you hit 21 exactly, you score 50M, and your hand\nstarts over the next time.  If you \"bust\" (go over 21), you get\nnothing, and your hand still starts over next time. \nHit Me also lights for Jack*bots during\nMultiball, and for up to 75M points during\nHurry Up.\n\nInlanes/Outlanes\n\nTalk about a trip down memory lane... Inlanes and outlanes the same\nsize, with actual rubber on the post between them.  Neat.  Any or\nall of the inlanes/outlanes can be lit for\nExtra Ball; the flipper buttons move the\nlit lanes around.\n\nFlippers\n\nThe usual two, in the usual places.  There's a center post, though\nthe gap between the flippers is narrow enough that it's usually\npossible to save the ball without the center post anyway.\n\nSlingshots\n\nStandard, just like the flippers.\n\nPoker Targets\n\nA bank of three drop targets, on the left side of the machine, below\nthe ramp entrance.  During regular play, one of\nthese three targets is lit (the lit target changes every few seconds);\nhitting that lit target, without hitting either of the others first,\nadvances the bonus multiplier.  (If you hit an\nunlit target first, you lose the chance to advance the bonus until\nthe targets reset--see below.)\nAbout five seconds after you hit a target, the target bank resets.\nIf you can hit the other two targets before this happens, a\npoker card is spotted, and the target bank\nresets immediately. \nA rebound from here to the row targets\nis a 15M \"BANKSHOT\".\n\nCashier Target\n\nThis target is under the ramp entrance; during\nmodes in which it's available, the ramp entrance flips up to reveal\nit.  It collects the bonus during Cashier mode,\ncollects the Solar Jets award, doubles\nsome Game awards, relights the\nGame Saucer (but not after the first\nCasino Run), and can be lit for Jack*bots\nduring Multiball.\n\nRamp\n\nThe ramp entrance is on the upper-left.  The ramp is not always\navailable, since the ramp entrance can flip up to reveal the\nCashier target.  Starts lots of modes;\nrelights the Game Saucer.\nLots of interesting things happen on the ramp.  See the\nrules section for more info.\n\nGame Saucer\n\nA narrow lane between the ramp and the\nVisor, at the upper left.  Starts\nGames, as you could probably guess from the\nname.  Also relights Jack*bots during\nMultiball, and spins the wheels during\nCasino Run.\n\nVisor\n\nA bank of 5 touch targets, dead center at the top of the playfield.\nIt can be lowered to reveal the Eyes.\nHitting Visor targets lights the\nKeno Lights to open the Visor and eventually\nstart Multiball.  Visor targets can also be lit\nfor Keno awards.\n\nEyes\n\nTwo locks, normally blocked off by the Visor.\nBalls are locked here to start Multiball, and\nthey score Jack*bots during it.  Shots here also spin the wheels\nduring Casino Run.\n\nKeno Lights\n\nA 5x5 grid of lights, just below the Visor.  Each\ntarget on the Visor corresponds to one column of Keno lights; each\ntarget on the other bank corresponds to one row. \nThese lights are lit by Visor and row target hits.  They open the Visor\nto start Multiball; they can also light\nExtra Ball. \nIn addition to these lights, there are five arrow-shaped lights, one for\neach column on the Keno card; these give Keno\nAwards while filling the Visor.\n\nRow Targets\n\nAnother bank of five targets, just below and to the right of the\nVisor.  This bank doesn't move, though, unless the\ngame is badly out of order.\nHitting these targets lights Keno lights.\n\nVortex\n\nThe plunger leads to this spiral, with three holes.  At the start\nof the game, the first and third holes are worth 10M; the second\nhole is worth triple this amount, permanently raises future skill\nshot values by 5M, and advances the bonus multiplier. \nHitting the ramp, or collecting \"Vortex at\nMax\" as a Keno award or during\nCasino Run, can raise the skill shot\nvalue; \"Add Vortex X\" awards from these same sources can raise the\nVortex multiplier.  The second hole is always worth 2x more than\nthe first and third holes; so advancing the multiplier changes the\nawards from 1x-3x-1x to 2x-4x-2x, then 3x-5x-3x, and so on. \nUnless you get the \"Vortex Value Held\" award, the Vortex value\nresets to 10M between balls; the only increase that does not reset\nis the +5M increases from made skill shots.  The Vortex value can\nnever be higher than 50M. \nThese skill shot awards change during\nMultiball and\nCasino Run. \nWhether or not you make this shot, it leads to the\nSolar Jets.\n\nSolar Jets\n\nA set of three bumpers at the top right of the playfield.  The\nSkill Shot leads here; so can the\nramp.  These bumpers advance the\nRoll the Dice value, and build the points\nduring Solar Jets mode.\n\n\nRules\nThe usual pinball rules apply; one to four players, three balls per\nplayer by default, hit the start button once for each player, try not\nto slam-tilt, etc., etc.  See the Funhouse rules sheet for more info.\n:-) \nEach ball starts with a skill shot.\nA ballsaver activates for about 6 seconds at the start of each ball.\nBought extra balls have a ballsaver for about 30 seconds. \nThere are basically two tracks to follow in this game (though both can\nbe pursued at once); going for Multiball, and going for Casino Run.\nGoing for Multiball\nTo start Multiball, you first have to complete your Keno card to open\nthe Visor, then lock two balls in the\nEyes behind it.\n\nFilling the Keno Card\n\nAt the start of the game, and each time you finish Multiball, the 25\nKeno lights are unlit.  (Actually, the game flashes them in pretty\npatterns, but if a Keno light isn't lit solidly, it doesn't count.)\nTo advance towards Multiball, you have to light all 25 lights to open\nthe Visor. \nThe first time through (before starting Multiball in a game), the rules\nhere are very simple.  Hitting one of the five Visor targets lights\nthat target's entire column on the Keno card; so only five target hits\nare needed to complete the card.  The five row targets are ignored.\nIf you hit two Visor targets at once, the game will only credit you for\none of them; on the brighter side, if you hit a Visor target you've\nalready hit (so its column is already complete), but you haven't hit one\nof the targets next to it, the game will light one of those columns\ninstead.  So you can only \"waste\" a Visor shot at this stage if the\ntarget you hit and both adjacent targets are already completed. \nThe second time through (after starting Multiball the first time),\nthings get a bit more complicated.  Now, both the Visor targets and the\nrow targets are used.  Hitting a Visor target lights the bottommost\ntwo unlit Keno lights in its column; hitting a row target lights the\ntwo leftmost unlit Keno lights in its row.  Hitting a target whose row\nor column is already filled is a waste.  So somewhere between thirteen\nand fifteen target hits are needed to finish the card.  On the bright\nside, the game will count multiple target hits this time.  The best\napproach is to bank balls from the left flipper off the row targets\nand into the Visor targets; this can get the ball ricocheting around\nthe targets, racking up seven or eight of them before falling back\nout--I've seen the card filled with as few as three shots from the\nflippers this way.\nSounds hard?  Well, there's a way out.  At the start of each Keno card\n(when you haven't hit any of the targets yet), the game flashes one row\nor column of lights at a time--first the rows from the bottom up, then\nthe columns from the left to the right, then back to the rows.  Hitting\nthe flashing row of column's target immediately completes the card,\nopens the Visor, and awards 50M for a job well done.  (But there's a\ncatch to this too:  when the game starts requiring you to fill the card\nonce for each ball [after the second Multiball], there is no flashing\nrow/column for the second card--you have to do it the hard way.)\nKeno Awards\nWhile you're filling the Visor, one of the arrow-shaped lights just\nbelow the Visor will usually be lit; the light works its way from left\nto right, then skips back to the left.  Hitting the Visor target that's\nlit gives a \"Keno Award\".  The award is displayed on the scoreboard,\nand some of them are announced through the speaker as well; it's a pity\nthe rest of them aren't, because the moment when a ball is rebounding\noff the Visor is a bad time to be looking at the scoreboard. :-) \nThe Keno awards I've seen are:  25M; Add Vortex X; Vortex At Max;\nVortex Held; Add Poker Card.  Before you start Multiball the first\ntime, if the Game Saucer is unlit, the Keno\naward will always be \"Game Saucer Lit\".  If your score is below 300M\non ball 3, head for the Keno awards; the first one you get will\nnearly always be \"Extra Ball\".\nLocking Balls\nOnce you complete the Keno Card, the Visor will open, exposing the two\nEye locks.  For the first two Multiballs, all you have to do then is to\nlock a ball in each Eye to start Multiball.  From then on, things get\nharder; locking the first ball closes the Visor, requiring you to fill\nanother Keno card to reopen the Visor to lock the second ball. \nIn multi-player games, the rules can get a bit more complicated.  If\nyou're trying to lock your first ball, but another player has already\nlocked one, you have to lock yours in the Eye he didn't use; the ball\nin the other Eye will then be kicked out, and you need to lock that one\nas well to start Multiball.  If you lock one ball, then another player\n\"uses it up\" by starting Multiball or Casino\nRun, the game still remembers that you had one locked, and\nMultiball will start when you lock another ball in either Eye.  (This\nstill may not be the best thing for you, though, since 3-ball Multiballs\nare impossible this way.) \nWhile you're trying to lock balls, hits to the row targets will still\nfill in two lights at a time in their rows on the Keno card.  If you\nactually manage to fill in the Keno card a second time this way before\nstarting Multiball, you light one of the more tedious\nExtra Balls in pinball history. :-)  (Fifteen\nhits are needed--or ten if you take advantage of the\nKeno game.)\nMultiball\nCompleting the Visor, then locking two balls in the Eyes, starts\nMultiball. \nThe first Multiball is a two-ball affair; the two balls in the Eyes are\nkicked out.  If only one ball is locked when you start Multiball,\nbecause another player stole one from you, the second ball is served to\nthe plunger instead; this is a bonus for you, since it lets you start\nthe Multiball with a skill shot instead.\nMaking the skill shot, by hitting the second hole on the Vortex, awards\na Jack*bot instead of the usual skill shot value. \nThe second and subsequent Multiballs are three-ball affairs (unless\nanother player stole a ball from you); a ball is always served to the\nplunger for a skill shot to start the Multiball. \nDuring Multiball, Jack*bots are lit at the Eyes, at the\nCashier target, and at\nHit Me.  The first Jack*Bot you score in a game\nis 50M; future Jack*bots increase in value by 25M each time, so that\nthe eleventh Jack*bot is 300M.  Then the value starts advancing by 50M\nfor each Jack*bot, so that the fifteenth and final Jack*bot is 500M. \nCollecting a Jack*bot unlights that location; at least one location will\nalways be lit--if you collect at all four places, the Cashier target\nwill be relit, and the lit location will move from left-to-right (to\nthe left Eye, then the right, then Hit Me, then back to Cashier) each\ntime it's collected. \nHitting the Game Saucer relights all four\nJack*bot locations.  If you hit it when all four are already lit, it\nscores a Jack*bot instead. \nCollecting Jack*bot at one of the Eyes, then hitting the other Eye\n(lit or not) within a second, scores a Super Jack*bot instead--this\ntriples the points (so a Super Jack*bot can be as high as 1.5B). \nMultiball ends when you're down to one ball in play; there's about a\nthree-second grace period during which a Jack*bot can still be scored.\nIf you lose a Multiball without scoring any Jack*bots at all, there's\na 10-second restart period; hitting the Eyes or the Game Saucer before\nthe time runs out restarts a two-ball Multiball with a skill shot at\nthe plunger.  Sorry, only one restart per Multiball. \nAfter Multiball is over, the Visor will remain open until the game\nsatisfies itself that the ball's in a place where it won't get caught\nbehind the Visor when it closes.  The ramp, the Cashier target, the\nGame Saucer, the rubber below the Game Saucer, the Poker Targets, and\nthe Solar Jets will all trigger the Visor to close.  As soon as the\nVisor starts closing, the Keno card will reset (with a row or column\nflashing for an instant Visor re-open), ready for you to start\nrefilling it.\nMega Visor\nOnce you score 15 Jack*bots, with Multiball still in progress, you\nenter the Mega Visor round.  The Visor closes; the object now is\nto re-open it.  The row targets are ignored; only the Visor targets\nthemselves count, and each hit spots one light in the column you\nhit, with 50M awarded for each light spotted.  Twenty-five hits are\nneeded to complete the card--on the bright side, that means 1.5B\npoints scored along the way. \nWhat happens when you fill the Keno card again and re-open the Visor?\nI don't know, okay?  I had to drive thirty miles uphill both ways\nto the nearest arcade with a Jack*Bot just to write this rules sheet,\nand between the gas money and the leg braces for little Bobby, I\njust haven't been able to afford to get the darn thing open, all\nright?  Fine, leave me wallowing in my shame.  Geez.\nGoing for Casino Run\nTo get a Casino Run, you first need to play all four Casino games.\nYou start games by hitting the Game Saucer\nwhen it's lit during single-ball play; if it's not lit, hitting the\nramp or Cashier target\nwill relight it, as will the Keno awards\nthe first time through.  Before you get your first Casino Run, the\nGame Saucer will always be lit at the start of each ball; for your\nsecond and subsequent ones, you'll always need to hit the ramp or\nCashier to relight it.  (Also, the Cashier target stops relighting the\nGame Saucer; you need to make actual ramp shots.)\nThe Games\nThere are four games to play.  The left flipper changes which one is\nlit, so if you can trap the ball on the right flipper, you can choose\nthe game you want before hitting the saucer to collect it. \nBeing the resourceful and morally corrupt robot that you are, you can\ncheat at all of these games (or at least try), by repeatedly hitting the\nExtra Ball button during the game's title screen.  The results vary from\ngame to game.  The quotes when the cheat succeeds are worth the price\nof admission.  \"LOOK--HALLEY'S COMET.\"  \"Where?\"  \"FOUR ACES.\"\n\"I saaaw thaaaat...\"\nMany game awards can be doubled.  After the game's score is determined,\nthe \"Double or Nothing\" screen is displayed.  Hitting the left flipper,\nor sitting there frozen in the headlights for ten seconds,\nlets you keep the current game score; hitting the right flipper instead\ngives you about 20 seconds (a slow count of 10) to hit the\nCashier target to score double the game's\nvalue--you get nothing if you miss.  Starting\nMultiball before the timer runs out will also\naward the doubled value.\n\nPinbot Poker\n\nThis game uses the poker hand displayed at the center of the playfield.\nThe Poker Targets,\nKeno awards, Casino\nRun, and Slot Machine can all light\ncards in this hand.  (Completing the hand the first time lights an\nExtra Ball.)  Points are awarded based on the\nvalue of the hand--10M for a measly single deuce, 15M for an ace or\nace-deuce, 20M for one pair, 30M for two pair or three of a kind, or\n50M for a full house (all five cards).  In addition, a flat 50M is scored\nfor each hand that you've already filled.  The resulting total can be\ndoubled.\nThis game is one of the easiest to cheat at; Pinbot pulls an extra\nAce from his sleeve.  (\"Ace of Clubs?\")  This can give you the normally-\nimpossible four Aces, worth 149M!  (Yes, you can still double this to\n298M.)\n\nSlot Machine\n\nThis one is about as straightforward as it gets; the slot machine reels\nspin and spit out a random (or is it?) award, which is what you get.\nAwards I've seen include: Multiball; Add 10 Cards (adds two complete\nhands to your Poker total); Hurry Up (shoot Hit\nMe for 75M, with the value counting down to a minimum of 15M); Collect\nBonus (exactly as it would be at the end of the ball, including\ncheating); Vortex at Max; Hold Vortex Value. \nOccasionally, the Slot Machine decides to screw you, and generates a\nrandom \"big points\" award, generally between 25M and 40M.  At least\nyou can double these.\n This is the hardest game to cheat at, for reasons that should be\nobvious when you see what the cheat does.  The initial spin brings up\na lame award (usually Add Vortex X; occasionally Hurry-Up or a\nbig-points value); Pinbot slams the reels, and they jump to\nExtra Ball Lit.  It's extremely rare for\nExtra Ball Lit to come up without cheating.\n\nRoll the Dice\n\nThis game revolves around your \"Dice Game Wager\", which starts each\ngame at 3M, and goes up by 100K for each hit of the\nSolar Jets.  Two dice are rolled; the laws\nof mathematics being what they are, this gives a number from 2 to 12.\nThis number is multiplied by your Dice Game Wager, and that's how\nmany points the game is worth.  This value can be doubled.\nThis game is the easiest to cheat at; Pinbot simply flicks the\ndice to 12 (\"BOXCARS...\").\n\nKeno\n\nThis game revolves around your Keno card.  Six random squares are\npicked; you get 5M for each of those squares that you have lit, plus\n5M just because you're you.  If all six squares are lit, you get 50M.\n25M is added for each card you've previously filled. \nIf you have five or fewer squares filled in when you start Keno, the\ngame spots the entire center column, to give you a reasonable chance\nat some matches.  (However, Keno still isn't a good mode to shoot\nfor if your Keno card is empty; not only will you not get many\nmatches, but the spotting of the center column will eliminate your\nchance to hit a flashing row/column to fill the card immediately.\nOn the brighter side, Keno is a great game to play if you're actually\ntrying to get the extra ball from filling\nthe Keno card while the Visor is already open; if you play Keno while\nthe card is still nearly empty, the center-column spot reduces the\nnumber of hits you need to fill each row from three to two, saving\nyou five hits.)\nThis game is moderately difficult to cheat at.  If you cheat,\nPinbot simply slams the entire card, resulting in \"25 MATCHES--99M\",\nplus 25M for each filled card.  (This does not actually spot all the\nKeno lights...)\n\n\nCasino Run\nAs soon as you play the fourth Casino game, the\nGame Saucer lights for Casino Run; you\ndo not need to relight it.  Hit the Game Saucer to start the Run. \nA pretty impressive animation sequence starts the Run off.  The\nExtra Ball button \"lights for cheating\" during the entire sequence,\nbut the only effect I've noticed is that the cow moos if you hit the\nbutton enough times at the start of the animation--pressing the button\nafter that does not seem to have an effect. \nCasino Run is a 1-ball timed mode, lasting for 45 seconds (more or\nless).  The object is to build your Casino Run bank as high as\npossible before cashing it in, without letting time run out and\nwithout being bombed out of the mode. \nYour Casino Run bank starts at 100M.  An extra 4M is added for every\nswitch hit during the Run.  (So those Solar\nJets can actually be pretty lucrative--but don't forget, the\ntimer is running...)\nDuring the Run, the ramp is flipped up; the Cashier target doesn't\ndo anything unusual.  The object is to hit the holes (the Eyes, or\nthe Game Saucer); each hole shot, including the shot to the Game\nSaucer that starts the Run in the first place, gives you a spin\nof the wheels.  (If you've ever watched The Joker's Wild,\nyou'll feel right at home here...)  After each spin, you have\nthe option of taking the current contents of your bank (which ends\nthe Run), or risking it and letting the Run continue.  (Don't sit\nthere too long and think about it; if you take more than 10 seconds\nor so, the game will automatically choose the \"Collect Bank\" option\nfor you, and the Run will be over.) \nIf you lose a ball during the Run, or even within a couple of\nseconds after the clock hits zero, don't panic.  You'll get the\nball back at the plunger, for the low price of 5 seconds off the\nRun timer.  If there's at least 10 seconds still on the timer,\nmaking the skill shot adds another 10 seconds; if there's 9\nseconds or less, making the skill shot collects your bank and ends\nthe Run. \nHaving a ball already locked in an Eye when the Run starts is a\ndouble-edged sword.  On the one hand, as long as it's there, it\nblocks a potential shot to make a spin.  On the other hand, if\nyou drain with a ball in the lock, you don't take the usual\n5-second penalty; instead, you automatically get another spin,\nand then the ball is kicked out of the Eye to continue play. \nIn addition to the normal high scores, there's a single high score\nfor \"Casino Run Champion\"; it defaults to 1B.  Being the Casino\nRun Champion awards an extra credit; so know the Casino Run Champ\nvalue, and when your bank reaches it, mentally add a special to\nthe bank.  (Generally, this translates into \"Take the bank, you fool!\")\n\nCasino Run Spin Awards\n\nUnlike the Slot Machine game, each of\nthe three reels gives its own award on each spin during the Run.\nPossible values of each reel are:\n\n Points--anywhere from 15M to 50M (in 5M increments), or 75M,\nor 100M, 125M, or the occasional 150M.  The points are added to\nyour bank.\n Light Extra Ball--this goes into your\nbank too.\n Special--this also goes into your bank.\n Vortex X--adds a skill shot multiplier immediately.\n Bonus X--increases your bonus multiplier immediately.\n Vortex at Max--raises the skill shot value to 50M immediately.\n Poker Card--adds a card to your poker hand (which can wind up\nlighting the extra ball as well).\n Jack*Bot--The points are scored immediately; they don't go in\nyour bank.\n More Time--adds 15 seconds to the Casino Run clock.  Will not\nraise it above 45.\n Cow!--yes, an actual Super Stunt Cow is added to your bank,\nshipped straight to you from the Williams dairy.  (Actually, this\npromotion was found to violate certain federal laws concerning\nshipments of assault cattle across state lines, so you'll have to settle\nfor an automatic Special instead.  Sorry.)\n This Award Intentionally Left Blank--blank spaces often come up\non one or two reels.  Very little excitement potential here.\n No Bomb--A bucket of water.  No cash value.  Just like those\nadventure games, you'd better pick it up; it's bound to come in\nhandy sometime.\n Bomb--This kills your Casino Bank, ends the Run, spits in\nyour face and laughs at your car.  Well, unless you happen to have\none of those buckets of water lying around (see?  Told you it would\ncome in handy), in which case the Bomb and No Bomb cancel each other\nout and leave you with no damage beyond a vaguely nervous feeling.  Or\nunless you were prudent enough to hit the Extra Ball button like there\nwas no tomorrow while the reels were spinning, in which case Pinbot\nwill reach out and thwack the offending bomb into another award.\nBe careful!  Cheaters do occasionally fail to prosper--only bombs on\nthe center reel can be bonked away (though that's where the vast\nmajority of them turn up), and I've never seen it work more than once\nduring a run.  If you hear \"I'M BUSTED...\" or \"Oh no...\" while the\nwheels are spinning, you'll know that you've worn out your welcome...\n MK3 Hint--This award may only come up if you hold down both\nflipper buttons while the wheels are spinning.  (There's a code in MK3\nthat displays the text \"HOLD FLIPPERS DURING CASINO RUN\", and I never\ngot the MK3 Hints until I started doing this.  Actually, I hit the\nExtra Ball button until just before the first wheel stops, then\nswitch to holding down the flippers.)  Immediately after the spin\ncompletes, the display briefly shows a single position from a MK3 code,\nwhich is probably for the upcoming Ultimate version; so far I've only\nseen two positions: blank--Raiden--blank--blank--Yin Yang--blank.\nThose of you (like me) who barely recognize the characters in MK3 will\nstill want to root for these hints to show up; in addition to showing\nthe hint, it also awards an automatic Extra\nBall.  So I guess an MK3 Hint is like a Cow, but not quite as\nvaluable. :-)\n\n\n\nMore Rules\n\n\nRamp Rules\nThe ramp leads to a maze of posts.  While the ball is in these\nposts, the skill shot value goes\nup by 1M every 2 seconds, with a maximum increase of 8M per trip\nthrough the posts, and a maximum skill shot value of 50M.\nFrom the post maze, the ball can go one of three places (not\ncounting the occasional unlucky bounce back out onto the playfield\nwithout hitting anything):\n\nSolar Jets hole\n\nIf the ball falls through this hole and into the bumpers, it\ntriggers Solar Jets mode.  The ramp flips up; you have about 20\nseconds (a slow count of 10) to hit the\nCashier target to score the Solar\nJets value, which starts at 40M and goes up by 4M for each bumper\nhit.  Starting Multiball before the timer\nruns out will also score the Solar Jets award.\n\nPlunger lane\n\nThis triggers another skill shot.\n\nReturn lane\n\nThis track returns the ball to the right inlane.  It gives one of four\nawards, whichever award is lit at the time the ball hits the right\ninlane switch.  The first lit award is normally Light Extra Ball, and\nthe lit award normally changes every two seconds; since the ball usually\ntakes somewhere between three and five seconds to clear the maze, this\nmakes 25M and Cashier the most likely awards, with Mega Ramp less\nlikely, and Light Extra Ball least of all.  However, if you're doing\nbadly on ball 3, the machine may start with Cashier lit instead, making\nMega Ramp and Light Extra Ball the most likely awards.\n\nLight Extra Ball\n\nPretty self-explanatory; lights one of the inlanes/outlanes for\nExtra Ball.\n\n25 Million\n\nAgain, pretty self-explanatory.\n\nCashier\n\nLights the Cashier target to collect 2x\nyour current bonus value.  (This 2x replaces the bonus\nmultiplier; it doesn't add onto it--so your bonus multiplier doesn't\nfactor into the Cashier award at all.)  You have about 20 seconds (a\nslow count of 10) to collect; starting Multiball\nbefore the timer runs out also collects.\n\nMega Ramp\n\nLights the ramp.  Shooting it within five seconds\nor so awards 50M.  The return lane award is automatically frozen at\nMega Ramp again; if you collect it again and shoot the ramp again,\nyou get 75M, then 100M, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nBonus\nAt the end of every ball, you get bonus from three areas:\n\n Cards--3M for each Poker and Hit Me card you've collected\nduring the game.\n Vortex Value--whatever the current skill shot value is\n(without the multiplier), that's what you get.  This will be\nbetween 10M and 50M.\n Dice Game Wager--whatever your current wager is, you get.\n\nThe entire bonus then gets multiplied by the bonus multiplier;\nthis will be between 1x and 5x.  (Remember, the bonus multiplier\nis raised at the Poker targets.) \nIf you press Extra Ball repeatedly during the bonus count, Pinbot\nmay cheat on the bonus multiplier; this gives you an extra bonus\nX.  (Yes, you can go to 6X this way.  Yes, you can cheat here on\nthe Collect Bonus award from the Slot\nMachine too.)  Your bonus multiplier must be at least 2x for\ncheating to have a chance to work; if it's 1x, you just lose.\nExtra Balls\nExtra balls abound on this machine.  With two exceptions, all\nof these light an inlane/outlane for Extra Ball;\nuse the flipper buttons to move the light to where the ball is.\n\nCompleting the first Poker hand.\nCompleting the Keno Lights with the Visor\nalready open.\nCollecting one on the Slot Machine,\nusually by cheating.\nCollecting \"Light Extra Ball\" in your bank in\nCasino Run.\nCollecting an MK3 Hint during Casino Run.  (This one is automatic;\nit doesn't light an inlane/outlane.)\nPity Extra Ball:  Collecting the first Keno\nAward of ball 3 with your score under 300M.  (This is automatic too.)\nCollecting \"Light Extra Ball\" from the return lane on the\nramp.  (The Return of Pity Extra Ball:  This is\nmuch easier on ball 3 with a score under 300M.)\n\nBugs/Misfeatures\nThe software I've seen for this machine is extremely solid.  There's\nonly a few minor glitches I've run into:\n\n If you start Multiball while the animation for an Extra Ball is in\nprogress, the Multiball animation is never displayed, and Multiball\nstarts immediately.  If this is the second Multiball, this isn't so bad;\nbut if it's the first, if you've stepped away from the machine to watch\nthe show, your first sign that something is amiss may be the sight of\nthe balls streaking towards the drain...\n If you cheat on a Casino game, and take the resulting points\n(without doubling), and make replay as a result, the Replay animation\nis sometimes skipped, and the ball winds up just sitting in the Game\nSaucer for ten seconds or so--presumably waiting for the nonexistent\nReplay animation to finish.\n If you get Collect Bonus on the Slot Machine, and you successfully\ncheat during the bonus count to get the extra multiplier, the ball\nsometimes kicks out of the game saucer a few seconds early--as if it\nwere kicking it out at the time the bonus count would have been over if\nyou hadn't cheated.  It doesn't sound the usual \"here it comes\" effect\nwhen it does this, so it can catch you off-guard.\n If you hit the Poker Targets just after they've been reset after\na time-out, the game will assume that the target reset failed and just\nreset them again, without awarding any points (or any bonus multiplier\nincrease, if you hit the lit target).  This happens even if the target\nyou hit wasn't one of the targets that needed to be reset.\n A few people on the net (myself included) were complaining that\nthe buy-in screen doesn't show you the information you really need to\nknow--the replay score, or the high score you're shooting at.  Someone\nat Williams was obviously listening; the buy-in screen now shows that.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't show it until there's 1 second left on the\nbuy-in clock.  If there's no credits in the machine, this isn't as much\nof a problem (you can just hit the Extra Ball button without inserting\nany money first, to reset the clock); but if there are credits there,\nyou just have to read the replay/high score, compare it to your current\nscore, and make the decision of whether or not to buy-in in the 0.8\nseconds you have left. :-)\n Normally, if a ball drains without hitting any scoring switches, you\nget it back.  On most machines, it's easy to tell--if your score is\nflashing, you haven't hit any switches yet, so you can let it drain safely.\nUnfortunately, on Jack*bot, the screen is filled by the skill shot graphics,\nand you can't see your score.  So you can plunge a ball, have it come up\nshort of the Vortex hole, dribble back through the Solar Jets while only\nhitting the rubber below the Jets (which doesn't end the skill shot or\nremove its graphics), drain, and go straight from skill shot graphics to\nFun with Bonus.  Disconcerting.\n\nNeat Stuff\nHere's some neat things to try.\n\n During the attract mode (which tells you about cheating--\"REPEATEDLY\nPRESS EXTRA BALL WHEN FLASHING\"), wait for the \"IN MEMORY OF JIM JOOS\nJR.\" screen (it can take a few minutes).

Any rules which I\nhave made up and are not actually part of the game are (c) 1995 Rich\nDerr.\nI have no idea exactly what versions of the game software were used\nto write this rulesheet, although I can distinguish between three\nversions, at least.\nYou may also be interested in reading the\nrule card on the game, or in finding out\nwho created Johnny Mnemonic.  You are\nprobably not interested in the\nauthor\nof this rulesheet.\nThank-yous\n\nJoel Iott <joeli@eurpd.csg.mot.com>\nfor posting to rec.games.pinball\nsome notes,\nincluding one I hadn't myself noticed\n(the Yakuza Strike/Mnemonic Recovery bit).\n\nPlayfield\nAs always, we start from the drain and go clockwise.\n\nFlippersI think these are small flippers.  I say I think because I\nhave a hard time concentrating on these flippers.  The plastic and\nrubber are both black -- for my first game, I could hardly use them at\nall.  While the flippers are small, the gap is small as well.\nSlingshotsTriangular, and as small as I've seen in a while.\nLeft inlaneCan be lit for\n'Light Throwing Spears'.\nLeft OutlaneCan be lit for\n'Mnemonic Recovery'.  This is fortunate --\nthe machine at Gala North had the sidewall rubber post set all the way up,\nleaving just a huge amount of bare wood on the side.\nLeft StandupLights 'Access Jet Bumpers'.\nLeft LoopA typical left orbit.  There is a sensor gate at the entrance,\nbut nothing counts unless it goes at least most of the way around and\ndoesn't come back out the left orbit.\nWeak shots will come back out the spinner lane.  This can be\nlit by an orange arrow and a white triangle ('Anna').  This can be lit\nfor extra balls.\nLeft RampThink of Dr. Who's W ramp, on the other side.  This ramp is\nrather shallow and short, and is easily backhanded.  This has three red\ntriangle lights for Yakuza Strike, and can be lit\nby a white triangle\n('Upload').\nBumper areaThe upper left of the playfield is where the usual triangle\nof three bumpers and three rollovers reside.  The only way to exit the\nbumpers is through a narrow opening at the bottom -- think of T2.  Balls\ngo to the right slingshot after rolling along the left ramp wall.\nDivertersThe game's diverters are above the rollovers.\nOne diverter stops\nballs from the spinner lane and right loop (and plunger) from going\naround to the left loop and shunts them to the other diverter.  The other\ndiverter decides whether balls go to the data glove or the rollovers.\nData gloveA magnet crane with two degrees of freedom.  Never mind the\nplastic, this toy is a magnet that floats up near the glass, which can\nmove left, right, back, and forward.  When under the player's control,\nthe normal flipper buttons move it left and right, and extra buttons\nmove it back and forward.\nThere is a sinkhole in the diverter assembly which kicks the ball\nstraight up to the glove.  The glove holds on to the ball, moves, and\ndrops it.  When modes are being started, or when a ball reaches the\nsinkhole when it shouldn't, the glove moves slightly forward and drops\nit above the rollovers.  The primary purpose, however, is locking balls,\nwhich is done on the ...\nMatrixThink of a 3x3 grid of mass sensors, with a metal\nplate covering the vertical gaps.  Balls are locked here; the data\nglove moves over here and drops the ball on one of the sensors, under\nthe player's control.  When it comes time to unlock the balls, the\nmetal plate springs up in back which drops the balls into habitrails.\nThe matrix is in the upper (in both senses) right of the playfield.\nAfter taking the high road following the left ramp, we now take the\nlow.\nCrazy Bob'sThis is a sinkhole which is just about dead center in\nthe playfield.  It cannot be shot directly from the left due to a wall\n(part of the guide for balls leaving the bumpers).\nThe right side is open,\nand I've seen plenty of wild balls bounce in.  This is a deep sinkhole,\nand has a Neutral Zone-like thing for a backstop; I've only seen one\ndirect hit out of a hundred not fall in.  The kickout goes to the lower\npart of the right slingshot (usually), except when it goes to the knee\nof the right flipper.\nThis can be lit by an orange arrow and a white triangle\n('Download').  The sign above it can also light up -- not with a\ncoloured bulb as in TAF and TZ, but with a white lamp.  It's plenty\nvisible, and fits the theme, I guess.  Of course, it's also easy\nfor the operator to not realize it's a lamp instead of G.I.\nCenter LaneThis is shootable from either flipper, but is a very\nprecise shot from the left.  This can be lit by an orange arrow, a\ngreen arrow (Cyberlock), and can be lit for\nStart Mode (a big hexagon).\nThe center lane leads directly to the VUK in the diverter, but is\nprotected by a large drop target-like thing.  I say drop target-like\nbecause it is controlled completely through software -- you don't hit\nit to make it drop.  The target lowers when the lane is lit.\nSpinnerThis is not an ordinary spinner with an ordinary decal, this\nis a large, round spinner with a large, round decal.  The spinner seems\nheavier than the ordinary ones; I've seen plenty of balls hit it and\njust stop.  A good clean shot will send the ball on through towards the\ndiverter area.  If not diverted the ball will come out the left loop.\nIf diverted it can go to either the data glove or the rollovers.\nThis can be lit by an orange arrow and by a white triangle ('Power\nDown').  It can be lit be a green arrow (Cyberlock).  It can be lit\nfor Spinner Millions.\nRight RampI guess this is like the Beta Quadrant ramp, although it's\nbeen a while since I've seen a ST:TNG, and my memory isn't so good.\nIt's not as steep.  It can be hit from the right flipper, although not\nas a controlled shot.\nThis has three red triangle lights for\nYakuza Strike, and can be lit\nby a white triangle ('N.A.S. Riot').\nRight OrbitThe usual.  This sends balls to the same place the spinner\nlane does:  normally out the left orbit, but can be diverted to the\nglove or rollovers.  This can be lit by an orange arrow, a green arrow\n(Cyberlock), and a white triangle ('Cartoon Hero').\nRight StandupLights Mnemonic Recovery.  Note that\nthere is one big\ntarget, but two lights; it must be hit twice to light the saver.  And\nyou can't collect the first of those lights while Mnemonic Recovery is\nstill lit -- it does nothing unless M.R. is not presently lit.\nUpper Right RubberI mention this because there is a huge rubber\nband to the right of and below the right standup.  It's as big as a\nslingshot.  It keeps the ball moving horizontally after a shot to the\nstandup or a missed shot to the right side.\nPlungerAutomatic.  Merges with the right loop and can be diverted\nin the same ways.\nRight OutlaneGee, they put all that lovely rubber up by the standup,\nand left bare wood down here.  At Gala North, the rubber post was down\nfarther than the one on the left was, but not all the way.  Even with\nthe posts set to easy this is a bad place to get a ball.  Can be lit\nfor Special (from a \"Mystery\"\nMatrix Award.\nRight InlaneCan be lit for Hit Me.\n\nMiscellaneous Features\nSkill Shot\nThere is a skill shot at the start of each numbered ball and earned\nextra balls.  There is no skill shot following ball savers or locks.\nHit the launch button to plunge the ball.  It will be diverted to the\nrollovers.  The middle lane will be flashing; the flippers move the\nflashing light left and right.  If the ball goes through the correct\nlane, you score 25M x (number of skill shots made),\nplus 5 gigabytes.\nPlunging the ball scores 123,570 points.  I thought you'd\nlike to know.\nBonus X\nLight all three lanes to advance the bonus multiplier.  If a skill\nshot is made, the lane is not spotted.  Move the lights left and right\nwith the flippers.\nThe bonus multiplier can also be increased from a matrix award.\nIf the bonus multiplier was already at 5x,\n50M is awarded instead.\nIn early software versions, there was a potentially\nundesired behaviour regarding\nthe bonus multiplier and hold bonus.\nBumpers\nThe bumpers score 1,000,000 each in normal play.\nThe triangle is\nsuch that balls dropping through the middle lane often don't hit any\nbumpers.\nLoops\nThe left loop spots letters in Johnny,\nand the right loop spots letters in Mnemonic.\nCompleting Johnny Mnemonic starts\na frenzy:  every switch is worth 15,000,000\nfor 20 seconds.\nOne of the matrix awards is Super Loops, which makes loops worth\n25,000,000 the first time awarded,\n50,000,000 the second time, etc.\n(I think for the rest of the ball; I saw no timer.)\nI infer that the normal value is quite a bit less.\nRamps\nEach ramp shot scores 15,000,000.\nIf a red triangle remains unlit\non the ramp that was shot, one is lit.  When all six red lamps -- three\nat each ramp -- are lit, Yakuza Strike begins.\nShooting a ramp when a video frame is on the display collects one\nframe.  These are worth points in the bonus count, and at\nsome reflexing number (I've seen seven and eight)\nan extra ball is lit.  It appears that frames are\non the display whenever nothing else is -- when no modes or other at\nall special things (Yakuza Strike, Throwing Spears, Hit Me, Combos,\netc.) are happening.\nCombos\nI'm not sure exactly what makes a combo, but it's probably repeatedly\nmaking shots to the same side of the field, such as right loop -> right\nloop -> spinner -> right ramp.  (I think that would be three combos.)\nOf course, when you're doing this you have no time to look at the\ndisplay, so I have no idea how much these are worth or when they are\nscored.  I have gotten the impression that they are worth a few million\npoints and a couple gigabytes.  I could be confusing that with the\naward for hitting the loops themselves, of course.  Combos are worth\npoints in bonus.\nMnemonic Recovery\nIf this light is flashing when a ball drains down the left side,\nanother ball is plunged.  The plunged ball is not diverted, so it will\ncome out the left loop fast.  Don't watch the display; it's showing\nabstract art while your second chance is draining.\nThis starts the game lit, and once used, is relit by hitting the\nright standup twice.\nMnemonic Recovery cannot be relit during Yakuza Strike.\nNon-exclusive Scoring Modes\nYakuza Strike\nAfter each ramp has been hit three times, Yakuza Strike begins.\nDuring this round all the orange arrow shots plus both ramps are lit.\nA timer starts at 60,000,000 and counts down at about\n1,000,000/second.\nHit a shot to score the value remaining on the timer.  The mode stops\nat 25,000,000.\nThis mode can continue during, and I do believe start during,\nmultiball.  If you can hit the sixth ramp and immediately lock the\nthird ball, a billion from Yakuza Strike is not out of the question.\nDuring Yakuza Strike, Bob's Bunker does not give out hints -- it\nscores the timer and immediately spits out the ball.  It does, however,\ngive out the power item award if lit.\nThrowing Spears\nDuring most of the game, the left inlane will light Throwing Spears.\nTo collect the award, shoot either the right ramp or right loop.  This\nis a timed shot, and there is time to try again if you miss the first\ntime, but not that much extra.  After making the shot or having time\nrun out, the left inlane relights.\nThe following are awarded in order every time, and reset upon every\ndrain.\n\nGigabytes\nThe display doesn't say how many, though.\nBig Points\nAgain, I don't know how many.  I doubt it's 'big'.\nLite Spinner\nWhen lit, the spinner is worth 1,000,000/spin, instead of\n100,000/spin.\nQuick Multiball\nA second ball is plunged.  The ramps award jackpots of\n50,000,000\neach, as many times as you can hit them.  This continues until you drain\none or both balls.\nHold Bonus\nNow go for those bumper lanes!\nExtra Ball\nI think this actually awards the extra ball, and doesn't just light\nit.  It's one or the other.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a\nlimit on how often you can collect this.  (It's no more than once per\nball.  There may be no other limit other than the overall total extra\nballs/game adjustment.)\n\nHit Me\nDuring most of the game, the right inlane lights Hit Me.  You have a\nshort time -- essentially one shot -- to hit the left loop.  This is\nworth 25,000,000 the first time and 45,000,000\nthe second time ....  I don't know if the value resets\nto 25,000,000 every ball or not.\nI usually would have rather hit the\nleft ramp to set up a Throwing Spear shot.\nModes\nStart Mode\nThe center lane starts the game lit for Start Mode.  Shooting the\nball up that lane will send it to the VUK.  The ball is kicked to the\nglove, which moves forward and drops it above the bumper lanes to start\nthe mode.\nStart Mode is re-lit after locking a ball for multiball.  If the\nnumber of Start Mode shots made is less than the number of locks made\nin the game, Start Mode is re-lit by shooting Bob's Bunker.\nThe lit mode moves every couple seconds while Start Mode is lit.\nThis is quite a change from earlier versions, which required that\nthe modes be completed in sequence.  All five 'normal' modes must\nbe played before Power Down is lit.  After Power Down all modes\nbecome unlit, even if the playfield lamps don't immediately reflect\nthis.\nThese modes exclude Start Mode.  They do not\nexclude Yakuza Strike, Throwing Spears, and Hit Me.\nIn early versions they excluded multiball locks, but in the\nmost recent version locks can be lit unless the shot is used\nby the particular mode.  If multiball is started during a mode,\nthe mode may end (if little time remained) or pause and continue\nas it was when single-ball play resumes.\nScoring and Timing\nAll modes start with a base score of 30,000,000\nand 6 GB.\nScore by making shots indicated by lit white triangles.\nExcept for Upload, modes start with 25 seconds on the timer.\nHowever, after every shot is made the timer resets to\n15 seconds\nif it had counted down below that.  (This makes it very easy to\ncomplete the modes, which is valuable.  This latter behaviour\nwas not present in earlier versions.)\nUpload\nThe left loop, left ramp, right ramp, and right loop are lit.\nShoot them in any order.\nThe first shot is worth 50,000,000,\nthe second 70,000,000, the third 90,000,000, and\nthe fourth 110,000,000.  All shots are also worth\n6 GB.\nThe timer for this mode starts at about\n306 and counts down at about 15/second.\nEvery other mode has a\n25 second timer, so I'd bet this one does too, even though\nyou can't read it.\nCartoon Hero\nThe left ramp is lit.  After that shot is made, the right loop is\nlit.  The right ramp and left loop follow.\nThe first shot is worth 50,000,000,\nthe second 70,000,000, the third 90,000,000, and\nthe fourth 110,000,000.  All shots are also worth\n6 GB.\nIf you don't like seeing violence in pinball, don't watch the\ndisplay after shooting the right ramp!  (Right loop in early\nversions.)\nRiot\nThis is a bumper mode, unlike the others.  Bumpers score\n8,000,000 per hit.  The spinner lane and right loop are lit\nand diverted to the lanes.\nWhen the lanes are completed during Riot, not only is the\nBonus Multiplier increased, but the bumper scores are multiplied\nas well.\nI assume some gigabytes are also awarded in this mode, but I\ndon't really know how.  I also don't know what constitutes\nfinishing this mode -- I've had 82 hits and not lit\nCrazy Bob's.\nDownload\nHit the left loop three times for 60,000,000,\n90,000,000, and 120,000,000, plus\n6 GB per shot.\nN.A.S. Cure\nHit the center lane four times for 60,000,000,\n90,000,000, 120,000,000,\nand 150,000,000, plus 6 GB per shot.\nPower Items\nUpon completing any of the five modes, Crazy Bob's is lit (the\nsign above the hole, that is).  Shoot Crazy Bob's for a power\nitem and 200,000,000.\n(Early versions:  100,000,000.)\nPower items are one of the things that\nflashes by on the normal score display (along with current ball,\ncredits, gigabytes, and video frames).  Thus, I assume they are\nimportant.  They seem to effect how Power Down plays.\nPower Down\nAll white triangle shots are lit, and all four balls are put on\nthe field.  Each white triangle shot scores 400,000,000.\nWell, enjoy, because those shots start going away.  Every few seconds\nthe game announces that a section is being powered down, and those\nshots become unlit.  More than that, that whole portion of the\nfield goes dark, G.I. and all!\nIf you start Power Down with no power items, the shots start\ngoing away after just a few seconds, and the whole mode lasts\nmaybe 30 seconds.  If you collect some power items, it seems (I\ndon't get this far often enough to be sure) you get more time.\nOr maybe the shots are worth more, if they felt like borrowing a\ngood idea from ST:TNG.\nDrained balls are replunged after a five-second delay.  When the time\nruns out, there's nothing left to do, so stop flipping.  (Earlier\nversions killed the flippers.  I don't know why that changed.)  The\ntotal for the round is displayed, the lights come up, and a ball is\nplunged.\n(In early versions this mode was totally unbalancing.  The\npowering down part hadn't been implemented, so all the shots were\nlit all the time.  The timer behaved as if a whole bunch of power\nitems had been collected, and the mode lasted at least sixty\nseconds, if not ninety.  Not knowing what I was doing, as the\ndisplay didn't provide even the information that the white triangle\nshots scored at the time, I got 10,500,000,000 from\nthis mode.\nKnowing what I'm doing I haven't gotten half that since the rules\nchanged.)\nMultiball\nBob's Bunker\nDuring normal play, shooting Bob's Bunker will give you information\nabout one of the matrix awards.  This lights the first lock.\nLocks\nLocks are lit at the center lane, spinner lane, and right loop.\n(Start Mode takes priority over Cyberlock at the center lane.)\nShooting one of these sends the ball to the VUK, where it is kicked\nto the glove.  The glove is under the player's control, and you\nhave seven seconds to drop the ball where you wish.\nDropping the ball on a lock gives you an award.  These awards are\nshuffled after every multiball and every game, but information is\navailable from Bob's Bunker.\nAfter shooting the first lock, the display flips through six or\nseven of the possible awards.  At the same time, the lights on the\nphysical matrix itself flash.  Yes, the game is showing you what's\navailable at most of the locks!  Easy extra ball here.  (This is\nNOT duplicated on the display, as the physical lamps usually are.\nYou have to keep both the DMD and matrix in your vision, or quickly\nshift downward and to the right when you see 'Light Extra Ball' on\nthe display.  Never to my knowledge has the maintenance of lamps\nbeen so important to gameplay!)  (Also, in early versions what was\non the display did not have anything to do with the lamps being\nlit.)\nIf you drop the ball somewhere other than the matrix, the locks\nwill be re-lit.\nStart a mode to light the second and third locks.\nMatrix Awards\n\nBonus X\nHold Bonus\nLight Extra Ball\nLight Crazy Bob's -- lights Crazy Bob's for a\npower item (the name of which appears to be\nmeaningless, but which always\noccur in the same order) and 200,000,000.\n50 GB -- becomes 10 GB if collected more than once in a game.\nSuper Loops -- the left and right loops score\n25,000,000 for the rest\nof the ball.  50,000,000 if collected again in the game,\nand probably more if collected even more often.\nAward Bonus\nVideo Mode -- A curious mode.  You must use all four buttons to move\nyour square around the display and catch all the dots before time\nruns out.\nMy best guess at the scoring is\n15,000,000/catch after the first.\nI've never completed Wave 1, so there may be completion bonuses\nor additional points on subsequent waves that I don't know about.\nMystery -- This can start Yakuza Strike,\naward points or gigabytes, light an extra ball or\nthe right outlane special, and\nstart Touch-Tone Multiball.  It can probably do most anything.  (In\nearly versions, this always started Touch-Tone Multiball when\npossible.  In later versions it rarely does, thankfully.)\n\nTouch-Tone Multiball\nTwo balls are launched.  The goal is to hit Crazy Bob's as often\nas possible while keeping both balls in play.\nOn the display, the digits 1-9\nrandomly flash on the telephone.\nThe first hit to Crazy Bob's sets whatever digit is lit as the\n10,000,000 digit of the jackpot.\nThe second hit sets the 1,000,000\ndigit of the jackpot.  The third hit awards the jackpot.  Repeat as\noften as possible while keeping one ball in play.\nThis mode precludes normal modes and further locks while running.\n(This is very infrequently awarded in recent versions.\nConsidering the difficulty of hitting Crazy Bob's three times,\nthe fact that even 99,000,000 is not much reward, and\nthe possibility of draining both balls, I'm not sorry to see\nit go.)\nMultiball\nAfter three locks, the balls are released.  Balls locked in\nthe left column go to the bumpers.  Balls locked in the middle\ncolumn go to the left flipper.  Balls locked in the right column\ngo to the right flipper.  There is a ball saver at the start of\nmultiball which is longer than the usual (insignificant)\nstart-of-ball saver.\nThe shots lit for jackpots vary.\nAt first, three shots are lit.  After the first three jackpots have\nbeen collected, the jackpot rotates between the three.  Which three\nshots they are go according to where the balls were locked:\n\nRight Jet Lane    Right Loop      Crazy Bob's\nMiddle Jet Lane   Right Ramp      Left Ramp\nLeft Jet Lane     Spinner Loop    Left Loop\n\nMy best guess at the value of jackpots is:  30,000,000\nfor the first three, 40,000,000 for the fourth,\n50,000,000 for the fifth,\nand so on.\nIf the three balls were locked in a row, jackpots are\ntripled.\nBetween getting good matrix awards, getting shots you can make\neasily lit for jackpots, and getting all three balls in a row,\nlocking balls in JM is not trivial.\nWrapping Up\nBonus\nAfter each ball, you are awarded 4,000,000 for each\nvideo frame and 100,000 for each gigabyte you have\ncollected up to that point\nin the game.  You also get 5,000,000 for each combo made\nin that ball.\nHold Bonus\nHold Bonus now works like every other Hold Bonus in pinball.\nThe value after multiplier is remembered, and added in after the\nmultiplier has taken effect in the next ball.  Hold Bonus also\nholds the Bonus Multiplier for the next ball.\nIn early versions it was added in before\nthe multiplier on the next ball.  However, it did not hold the\nmultiplier between balls.\nHold Bonus has no effect if collected on the last ball.\nBuy-ins\nYou can buy-in once.  Nothing special happens except for a\nreasonable ball-save.\nHigh Scores\nThere is a Grand Champion, and High Scores 1-4 are kept.  There\nis no separate table for bought-in games.\nThe most recent person to collect 320 GB is stored as the\nCyberpunk.\n10,000,000,000\nThe display has no trouble showing these somewhat high scores at\nany time.  Anyone gotten it up to 100,000,000,000 yet?\nMatch\nJust the basic animation first seen in ST:TNG.  So?\nBroken Dataglove Compensation\nIt seems like the big toy is always breaking.  Obviously, this\naffects gameplay. Here's how.\nLocks are virtual; balls will be autoplunged when multiball\nstarts.  When Crazy Bob's would have just shown the location of\nan award, it now gives that award immediately.  The player gets\nno choice.  I don't know what the jackpot shots are or whether\nthey are tripled in this compensation mode.\nThe game tries to keep balls away from the VUK.  The drop\ntarget registers as a center lane shot.  (Warning:  these tend\nto drop SDTM.  There ought to be a ball saver.)  Spinner lane\nand right loop shots that would have been eligible for locking\ngo out around the left orbit, scoring the virtual lock as they\ngo.  When a ball does get to the VUK, and it will, the game\nrepeatedly and quickly fires the kicker, so that the ball will\neventually accumulate enough spin to bounce off the dataglove\nsideways and not return to the VUK.  This typically requires\nfive to ten kicks, and does work.\nThis is not a compensation that gives you an advantage\n(like a bad trunk in ToM or mini-playfield stuck up in Dr. Who).\nBy taking away the best opportunity for a break, it really makes\nthe game much harder.  Don't feel bad about not playing a broken\nJM.\n\nRule Card\n\nThis is a direct copy of the rule card in JM, and is reproduced for\ncompleteness.

Written by Bill Cooper\n(former Jokerz owner -- it left to make room for Whirlwind).\nInitial version written 19-20 October, 1995, in response to\na request from a new owner. Posted to the net as a item of potential\ninterest for other owners, or potential future owners.  Feel free to\ncopy and distribute as you see fit.\n\nFeatures and layout\nLayout\nStarting at left flipper and moving clockwise around the playfield:\n\nlower left drop targets, left ramp entrance, upper left drop targets,\ngate, B-E-T rollover lanes, draw poker saucer, right ramp entrance,\ndrop targets.  There is also an upper level at the back of the playfield\n(described below), three pop bumpers below the B-E-T rollovers, and the\n(raisable) center ramp and target.\n\nUpper level\nThe upper level is reachable via the plunger shot, and\nby two ramps on either side of the playfield.  There are five\nrollover lanes, each with it's own card, Ace (leftmost) through 10.\nGoing over a rollover lights that card (if unlit).  Flippers\nmove lit lanes in the usual way.\n\nRamps\nRight and left, starting halfway up the playfield and leading to the upper\nlevel.  Center ramp is raised by hitting center target.\n\nDrop targets\nThree banks of three:  Lower left, lower right and upper left on\nthe playfield.\nShots and strategies:\nThe best shot to master\nThe easiest way to rack up points is to shoot the gate above the\nupper left drop targets.  This lights the lowest unlit card on the\nupper level, then ejects the ball into the B-E-T rollover area.\nThe ball then (hopefully) will bounce off the pop bumpers through\nthe rollovers a few times (advancing the bonus multiplier).  It will\nalso bounce back through the gate a fair proportion of the time,\nstarting the cycle over again.  The benefits are advancing the\nplayfield cards towards completion, as well as advancing the\nBonus X (which can light extra balls).  Finishing two hands on\nthe same ball can yield big points (assuming you max the bonus):\n100,000 + current bonus (including multiplier) for completing the hand\nplus the bonus awarded again at the end of the ball.  Shot is\neasily made from the right flipper, or an easy backhand from the left.\nThe target at the back of the gate doubles playfield values for\n20 seconds when hit during multiball.\n\nUpper level -- filling in the hand\nWhen the last rollover on the upper level is made, the game awards\n100,000 plus the bonus.  A special is lit in the draw poker saucer\nfor completing 3 (or however many are set) hands.  The lit bells in\nthe joker's hat (just above the flippers) let you know how many you\nhave completed.\n\nExtra balls\nTwo ways to get extra balls.  The first is to advance the bonus multiplier\nto the flashing value.  Only works once per ball, and reflexes from ball\nto ball.  This lights the extra ball over  the in/out lanes.  The other\nway is to get the extra ball award from the draw poker wheel.  I can't\nremember if this awards the ball directly or just lights the in- and out-\nlanes.\n\nLeft and right ramps\nThese shots always gave me difficulty, probably because the ball would\ngo almost to the top (and trigger the switch), then roll back down\nbetween the flippers.  A timely slap save helps immensely.  The left\nramp increases the ramp award.  Base is 10k, advances to (this is from\nmemory) 25k, 50k, 100k, 250k and 500k (max).  Right ramp collects\naward, and resets it to 10k.  Shooting both ramps within a timed\nperiod on the last ball doubles score.  Except for doubling score,\nI tended to avoid ramp shots.  Nigh unto impossible to backhand.\n\nRaising the center ramp\nThe center ramp shot is (at least for me) fairly tricky.  When\nraising the ramp, a shot from a ball trapped on the flipper usually\nleads to a drained ball.  A perfect on-target shot goes STDM, and if\nyou are off to either side, it bounces off the rubbers on the post\nstraight into the outlane.  The best way to make this shot is to flip\na live ball that has come down the inlane at an angle.  It hits the\ntarget and bounces off into play.\n\nDraw poker\nThe left inlane lights the draw poker saucer, located under the upper level\nnext to the right ramp.  May be shot from the left flipper, almost impossible\nto backhand unless the ball has exactly the right spin.  Saucer spins the\nwheel in the backglass, and awards range from 10k to Special.  Ball is\nejected to B-E-T rollover lanes.\n\nDrop target millions\nCompleting all three banks of drop targets starts a timed Millions mode.\nCompleting any bank of drop targets in the timed mode awards 1,000,000\npoints.  The upper left targets usually get completed when shooting\nthe upper left gate shot mentioned above.  I always found the lowest target\non both of the lower banks to be the most difficult to hit.\n\nJackpot\nThe jackpot is fairly difficult.  The award builds over time to a maximum\nof 4,000,000.  You need to raise the ramp, lock a ball, raise ramp\nagain, lock second ball to start multiball.  While multiball (2-ball only)\nis in progress, you need to make 4 center ramp shots (may be carried over\nto other multiballs depending on game adjustments).  The best strategy\nis to flip one ball up thorough the left gate, and let it bounce around\nin the pop bumpers.  Then you can concentrate on shooting the other ball\nup the ramp.  The ramp is relatively easy to hit from the left flipper,\nbut almost impossible from the right, unless you catch the ball, let it\nroll down the flipper, then shoot almost straight up the ramp.\nIf you get the balls under control when multiball starts, you have a chance.\nOtherwise (at least for me) one ball usually drains quickly.\n\nDoubling Score\nOn the last ball, you have a fixed period of time to double your score\nby shooting the left and right ramps.  I always try for it (who wouldn't),\nbut getting it was rare.  See ramp shots above.  Only awarded once per\ngame.  Shots do not carry over on extra balls -- you start over.  Time\ndecreases by 5 seconds for every million points you start the ball with,\nto a minimum time of 10 seconds.\n\nStrategy\nI'd usually shoot the first shot described above until extra ball is lit,\nthen shoot for the center ramp and try to collect the extra ball.  Repeat\non second ball.  Try to double score on third ball unless extra ball is\nlit.  If extra ball is lit on third ball, try to rack up points, collect\nextra ball, then double on extra ball.  Pretty boring after a while,\nbut it does rack up the points and extra balls\nTips/ things I had to repair\nThe prop rod tends to bang the connector for the lower right drop-target\nboard.  This leads to intermittent failure, which can lead to frustration\nif it stops working milliseconds before you hit the last target to\ncollect millions, doesn't register and the mode times out.  Solution\nis to simply replace the connector, and be careful when replacing the\nhood.\n\nIf the backglass wheel motor goes up, the Wms replacement part is\n$55.  I'd suggest that you try Steve Young of Mayfair (I sure wish\n\n[truncated? -ed]\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Jokerz!", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/jokerz.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Jokerz!", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Judge Dredd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Judge Dredd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiled by: Cameron Silver\n\nVersion 1.6: 10/Feb/1995\n\nUpdated by: Keith Johnson\nVersion 1.7: 10/Oct/1996\n\n\nExtra special thanks to:\n\n David (Arnie) Arnold\n Orin Day\n Kevin Martin\n Bowen Kerins\n Mario Moeller\n\n\nYou may do what you will with this rule sheet, but remember that\nJudge Dredd, Multiball and probably quite a few other things are most\nlikely copyright Bally/William's.\n\n\nNote from Keith:  I've just corrected some stuff that was wrong, mostly\nwith Crime Scenes and the SuperGame 100M.  I also added a Strategy\nsection (such as it is).  All of my comments are delimited within these\nasterisks.  [Changed to blockquote. - Ed.] The rest of the document is as\nit was written by Cameron.\n\n\nPlayfield Description\nI'll start in the lower left, and go around to the lower right.\nNote: Crime Scenes will be described in the Rules section!\n\n Flippers  There are four. Two regular (i.e.: BIG) ones in the usual\nplace; and another one half way up the left side (very much like Street\nFighter II). There is also a tiny flipper in the top right of the\nmachine, that faces the back; imagine a small flipper mounted behind\nthe slot machine on TZ, now move that up a bit, and you've got it.\n\n Diamond Buttons  Two of these and they're next to the flipper buttons.\nThey are large, and red; the machine calls them 'Fire' buttons, but\nthey have a '!' on them. The right one launches the ball, and lights\nthe next un-lit Chain Link More Later!. The left one fires the ball\nduring an Air Raid More Later!, and lights the previous un-lit Chain\nLink More Later!.\n\n Left Lanes  There is a kickback, but it's not an outlane, more\nof another automatic plunger lane on the left of the machine. Any\nball in this lane will be kicked out, except during an Air Raid. More Later!\nThis will reset the JUDGE drop targets More Later!. To the\nright of this is the outlane which is quite vicious, as shipped from\nBally, (with the post in the middle position), but I'm sure that when\nI move it down it will be better. I don't even want to think about what\noperators will do with this. It's a petty, because in my opinion it\nbrings the whole game down. The inlane is the usual type. The left\nin/out lanes do not light anything (as far as I could tell.)\n\n '?' I'll just call this the Bonus target  It's blue a round stand-up\ntarget with a large '?' in the playfield. It is in a similar position\nas The Lost Mine on White Water. When lit (during a Chain Link More Later!)\nit's gives bonuses related to each Link.  I'll explain it in\nmore detail later.\n\n Left Orbit (Crime Scene) It is a standard orbit that starts in the same\nplace as Party Zone's Rocket ramp. After a Left orbit shot, the ball will\nusually come screaming out of the right orbit, but beware: this can lead to\nan instant left drain. (The upper right mini flipper is located just at the\nentrance to the right orbit, so I just keep it raised, which prevents the\nleft drain - This is believed to have been designed like this). A slow\nshot around here that doesn't trickle out, will probably come out of the\nentrance to the Small Loop More Later!\n\n Extra Ball target  A small stand up target between the Left Orbit,\nand the Left Ramp. (There is also another EB target .. see below.)\n\n Left Ramp (Or Lock Ramp)  Balls put here will be fed to the right-most\nright in-lane. When lock is lit, a shot up here will register as one lock,\nbut the ball will not physically be locked! The third ball 'locked' will\nstart multi-ball. This ball will be diverted into the planet; meanwhile\nthree other balls will be launched. A soft shot up this ramp will fall into\nthe planet, but the machine will unlock it - the annoying thing is that\nmode timers DO NOT STOP!\n\n Planet [Dead World]  You can't miss this. It is used to lock balls for\nmultiball. It spins, and flashes and looks really pretty. At the start\nof multiball, balls are unlocked by a magnetic crane (like a record\nplayer). The only thing I don't like is that fact that there is no\nsetting to unlock balls between games; balls don't even get unlocked\nafter a Slam Tilt, which is stupid when you consider the fact that the\nSlam resets everything and the machine forgets how many balls are there!\nI also found that sometimes the crane didn't pick the balls up, but at\nleast the machine realized, and tried again. In Production machines, the\nplanet is disabled, and only the third ball locked will go there. The\nfirst two balls will just be fed back to the right inlanes (this makes\nmultiball really easy to start once lock is lit - Just three ramp shots).\nPhysical changes to the planet make it impossible for balls to remain\nthere.\n\n JUDGE  5 drop targets covering a hole. (Actually, only 'D' covers\nthe hole. It is wider than the other targets.) Lock is lit by spelling\nJUDGE (i.e: hitting them down in order...). Shooting the hole will spot\nthe next letter. Be careful, as a hard shot into the targets can send\nthe ball up onto the Air Raid habitrail More Later!, which can lead to\na left drain. The Drop Targets are also used in some Chain Links \n\n Subway Entrance The hole behind the wide D drop target. Any ball in\nhere will be popped into the left inlane.  This hole is lit for various\nthings during various Chain Links and multiballs. On prototype machines,\nthis is labeled as Pick A Prize.\n\n Small Loop (Crime Scene) A small orbit that goes under the Center\nRamp More Later!, joins the Left orbit to feed balls to the mini-flipper.\nIt's impossible to describe, but it seems to be the only obscured\npart of the playfield. The player must really look to see if it's\nlit. A small loop scores 3 million for the first shot, then an additional\n3 million for each consecutive shot. (I.e: 3, 6, 9 ..) If this crime scene\nis lit, it will be collected regardless of the balls direction. In fact,\nthis was once the last CS lit when the ball slowly rolled into the orbit.\nI was credited for the CS and bumped up to the next level. The CS was re-lit\nfor this level too. When the ball rolled down, I recollected it.\n\n Centre Ramp  A tiny ramp to the right of the small loop (It's in\na similar position as the Power ramp on Twilight Zone). The player\ncan shoot this ramp from the lower left flipper, but it's a HARD\nshot. It's much easier from the mini flipper. It feeds to the entrance\nof the left orbit, much like Disaster Drop in White Water. This is the\nJackpot ramp during the Blackout, and Battle Tank link.\n\n Sniper Tower (Crime Scene)  A ball popper situated in the same place\nas Twilight Zone's Lock but much easier to hit from the lower left\nflipper, or the mini flipper. Balls Popped from here are fed via habitrail\nto the left inlane. This can also be used to start Chain Links \n\n Air Raid  Ramp to the right of the Sniper Tower. It faces the upper\nleft flipper, but it's a hard shot. There is a light at the base,\nbut it seems to always be lit. It feeds the ball into the kickback/plunger\nlane. The drop targets will reset, and each one will be lit in turn.\nYou have to hit the left Fire button to fire the ball so that it hits\nthe lit target - I.e: Terminator 2 skill shot. (The ramp actually\nstops before the lane, and the speed of the ball makes it land in\nthe right spot; however a ball that's going slowly (which only happens\nwhen it pops up there from the drop targets) can be fed to the outlane\ninstead. NOT a good design.)\n\n Extra Ball target  Another small orange stand up target that is\nwedged between the Air Raid ramp, and the Large Loop. The two targets\nare identical.\n\n Large Loop (Crime Scene)  Right orbit. Just to the right of the Air\nRaid ramp. Hit this from the upper left flipper. It feeds the ball back\nto the upper left flipper for 3 Million (Increases with every consecutive\nshot). This is the skill-shot. A slow shot around here will come out of\nthe small loop.\n\n Advance Crime Level  A bank of three stand-up targets in the same\nposition as the BigFoot HotFoot targets on White Water (except facing\nthe left.) When lit, (only one hit is necessary - like the Cousin\nIt targets on TAF) advances the crimes from Warning -> Misdemeanor\n-> Felony -> Class X Felony More Later!; accompanied by a really cool\nBoom sound! This target bank is easy to hit just by holding the left\nflipper up when the ball comes screaming out of the orbit.\n\n Right Ramp (Crime Scene)  This is the Stake Out ramp. It is in the\nsame place as the ramp on Banzai Run. It feeds back to the left inlane\non the right side. Some people seem to think that this ramp is too\nsteep, but on the machine I played the ball made it most of the time.\n\n Reactors  Three captive balls (one per nuclear reactor) are in a\nline. (In a similar place to Extra Ball on White Water). There is\na roll-over between the first two, and a target at the end. I'm not\nsure how the scoring works during normal play, but I found out that\nafter 7 Targets (getting the last captive ball to hit the target),\nextra balls was lit. Also, getting the third ball to hit the target\nwill double your end of ball bonus for that ball. These are used during\nthe 'Melt Down' Chain Link. Don't be too distressed if you never get\nthe last ball to move, it's a very bad shot. I can't understand why\nthey made a playfield feature only used in one Chain Link.\n\n\nThis has been changed a little bit in production ROMs.  The 2nd target\nhit (all the way at the back) will award 2x bonus.  This includes\neverything that could be counted as bonus, including mode and Ultimate\nChallenge points!!  But since hits are cumulative through the game, I'm\nnot sure if you can get this again.  I need to get the glass off!  The\n4th target hit awards something amazingly stupid like 5M.\n\n\n\n Drain Shield  Ball saver. The light is in the playfield above the flippers,\nso this seems like an appropriate place for it in the rules! The factory\ndefault is 5 seconds, I extended it to 10 on the machine at work. While 5\nseconds is acceptable, it can be just that little bit too short as there\nisn't even a hint of a grace period. The 'Drain Shield' sign in the\nplayfield, flashes and when it times out, you hear \"Drain Shield,\nDe-Activated\". This can get annoying, but I no-longer even hear it!\n\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the Drain Shield isn't even activated\nuntil some major shot is made, or 4-5 switches.  If you hit the EB target\ninstead of the skill shot, you can let it drain as long as you don't hit\ntoo many other switches without the Drain Shield coming on.  When the\nball is saved, it will continue to be kicked out until you hit a switch.\n\n\n\n\nRules: \nChain Links\n\nA chain link is like a Door Panel / Mansion Room / Mode / Computer Screen\netc. To start a Link you simply need to shoot the Left ramp, or Sniper Tower\nwhen lit ('Build Up Chain Feature'), they alternate; the Left Ramp is lit\nfirst. Note that when lock is lit, only the Sniper Tower will start Links.\nTotal score from each Link is added in Fun With Bonus. Most of the Chain\nLinks last 30 seconds, and you get 3 million just for starting them!  I\nfound an adjustment in the menus, Shots for Mode: 2; so maybe more shots\nto 'Build Up Chain Feature' will be necessary on some machines. Perhaps\nit's self-adjusting?\n\n\nActually, all modes are 20 seconds long, unless noted.\n\n\nThere are nine (9) chain links. It's good to see that they didn't go\nballistic on JD like they did on Indi. The modes are less repetitive, and\nonly three involve shooting the ramps (and only one of those involve\nshooting both ramps - but there's a twist so it's ok).\n\nThe modes are 30 seconds each, unless stated otherwise:\nPursuit -> Black Out -> Sniper -> Battle Tank -> Bad Impression ->\nMelt Down -> Safe Cracker -> Manhunt Millions -> Stake Out => Ultimate\nChallenge.\n\n(I listed them in the order they cycle through. I'm unsure as to\nwhich one is lit at the start of a game.)\n\n\nSeems to be random.\n\n\n\n Pursuit  This, I believe, is a nice marriage between a video mode,\nand a pinball game. The display shows a car speeding along (similar\nto The Getaway's Video Mode, except that the animation is better)\nwith a police car following. The 'Pursuit' lights will flash at the\nentrance to the right and left ramps. By shooting either ramp, the\npolice car will shoot a missile at the car. The car swerves all over\nthe road so you have to time the ramp shot so that the missile will\nhit the car. If you hit the car you get 35 million - But I'm not sure\nwhere 35 came from.\n\n\nI believe you also get some small amount of points for each shot you\nmake that misses.  Still, the only way to score well is to get lucky\nand actually HIT the thing.\n\n\n\n Black Out  Two ball multiball, and all playfield scores are doubled.\nThe centre ramp is lit for as many 10 Million shots as you like, until 1\nor both balls drain. But don't fool yourself, it's not an easy shot.\n\n\nI like to use this mode after the first multiball to just shoot JUDGE.\nAnother strategy is to hold a ball on the left flipper and shoot the\nleft ramp over and over for doubles points (effectively 1M+1M).\nPerhaps after you've spelled JUDGE all you need to.\n\n\n\n Sniper  Display shows someone looking down from the tower on people below.\nOccasionally you see a person get shot! Meanwhile 20 Million is counting\ndown. Shoot the Sniper Tower to collect the lit value. The guy on\nthe tower will fall (gets shot!). Shoot the Sniper Tower again to\nre-collect the same value. You have 11 seconds while he falls. For\nmore info on the amusing quotes (if you really want it), see the\nspoilers!\n\n\n Battle Tank  The display shows a VERY mean and destructive looking\ndevice. You have to destroy it, but it's far too big to get rid of\nwith one hit, so you need three. The Left Orbit, Centre Ramp, and\nAdvance Crime Level are lit; shoot all three for 33 million. (I don't\nknow where they got 33 from, I think it's 10 million per shot + the\n3 million for starting the link.) There is a great feminine/computer\nsounding voice giving a rundown on how much is destroyed.\n\n\nYes, 3M+10M/shot.\n\n\n\n Bad Impersonator  This is great. The display shows a guy dancing\non a stage. The drop targets are lit two at a time in a T2-like manner,\n(J+U, then U+D etc). You have to hit the lit targets to through things\nat the guy on the stage. After the the 3 million for starting the round,\nit's 5 Million for every target hit. If the two lit targets are hit , 10 Million is awarded.\n\n\n Melt Down  Hit The captive balls to stabilize the three reactors. Three\nhits are necessary - That is, three switch closures; so if you smack\nthe first captive ball so hard that it hits the second and third,\nthen you stabilize all three reactors. Alternatively, you can just\nhit the first captive ball three times. The total is 33 Million. Again\nI think it's 10 million for each reactor, and 3 million for starting it.\n\n\nYup, this also is 3M+10M/shot.\n\n\n\n Safe Cracker  It's good to see they continued the humor displayed in\nCFBL's 'Move Your Car'! The display shows a guy sleeping by a safe, while\nsomeone yells \"Open that safe!\". You have to get the ball into the\nSubway enough times to wake the guy up, and open the safe. After\nfour attempts the guy wakes up and opens the safe. See the spoilers\nif you really want to know what happens, but you really should wait!\nThe scoring works like Move Your Car in CFBL, it starts at 8 Million and\ncounts down to 3 Million; the second and later shots award that value\nagain. The maximum amount for this is 8 Mill * 4 Shots = 32 Million.\n\n\nThe scoring is almost like Move Your Car.  In Move Your Car, you actually\nGOT 2x, 3x, and 4x the values (for a maximum of 80M).  In this mode, you\nonly get the same points for each shot.\n\nThere's also something weird about this mode.  If you hit it during the\nopening animation, your score will be 8M.  If you wait just a little bit,\nwhen it starts counting down, the value will be over 8M, like it\nstarted at 9M or something.  Weird.\n\n\n\n Manhunt Millions  A very disappointing round. The left ramp is lit\nfor 6 million a shot. You can hit for as long as you like for the amount\nof time (20 seconds). Once you get in the rhythm, this can lead up\nto huge scores.\n\n\n Stake Out  Display shows Judge Dredd using binoculars to look into an\napartment window (see the spoilers for what he sees/says!). Shoot the right\nramp for 5 million a shot. This was also a little disappointing, but\nthe animation was so good that the simplicity of the round didn't\nbother me.\n\n\n Ultimate Challenge  See the spoilers.\n\n\n\nI've already mentioned the Bonus ('?') target. During each mode this\nis lit, and once it's hit, it's no longer lit. Hitting it is in the\nplayers best interest, I'll describe the effects below: [Note: A * means\nthat there is more info in the Spoilers]\n\n\n Pursuit - Shoots two missiles at the car.\n Black Out  - Gives you a once off 10 million.\n Sniper - The display says 'Hang up on fence, use red buttons'.*\n Battle Tank - Extends the timer *** (by 10 seconds) ***\n Impersonator - Three drop targets will be lit at a time instead of two\n Melt Down - Secures all reactors, and awards the points too\n Safe Cracker - Another message: 'When you're hungry press red buttons'.*\n Millions - Extends timer *** (by 10 seconds) ***\n Stake Out - Increases ramp value from 5 to 10 Million.\n\n\nCrime Scenes\n\nThere are 5 Crime Scenes scattered around the playfield. The only\nanalogy I can think of is that they're like Hazards in While Water.\nCrime Scenes are the left Orbit, Small Loop, Sniper Tower, Large Loop,\nand right Ramp.\n\nShooting a crime scene will sentence a criminal..\n\n\n Warning for Smoking\n Warning for Spitting\n 1 year for Littering\n 1 year for Flatulism (!)\n 2 years for Speeding\n 15 years for Assault\n 23 years for Extortion\n 25 years for Arms Dealing (it's the girl from CFBL!)\n 35 years for Armed Robbery (the 'snackbar' guy from CFBL)\n 85 years for Kidnapping\n Life for Murder\n Life for Terrorism\n Life for Treason\n Life for Cannibalism (mmmm donuts!)\n\n\nAt the start of the game, there are usually 4 Crime Scenes lit.  The\ncrime level associated with them is random, AFAIK, but is usually\neither Warning or Misdemeanor.  Different scenes can be at different\nlevels.\n\nThe levels are:\n\n\nLevel NameColourMillions of points per scene\nWarning               Green          1 \nMisdemeanor           Yellow         2 \nFelony                Red            3 \nClass X Felony        White          4 \n\n\nHitting the Advance Crime Level target advances all scenes one level\nup from what they were, to a maximum of Class X Felony.  It also scores\n1M.  After ALL lit Crime Scenes are at Class X, the Advance Crime Level\ntarget unlights.\n\nThe Crime Scenes stay lit until you shoot them.  After you've shot them\nall, another 3 or 4 will randomly light up at random levels.\n\nThat's all there is to it!  The bottom lights depicting the Crime\nLevels are actually mostly useless.  They only light up when a scene is\nat that level.  Since scenes can start at different levels, that's why\nmore than one can be lit at a time.  The only real useful use of these\nlights are during SuperGame.\n\nOn our machine, extra ball was lit at both targets after 7 crime\nscenes, and the next at 22.\nAnd every 15 Scenes after that, pretty much forever.  I [Keefer]\nhave gotten the\n82 Crime Scene extra ball before, and the next one was indeed lit at\n97.  Didn't light the 97 one, though.  Drained with like 95.  :(\n\nThe actual crimes get worse at the higher levels, e.g.: \"Life for\nCannibalism\". The animation is nice, and the quotes make it clear\nthat a Crime Scene has been hit. Be careful of burned out globes,\nand remember to check the Small loop, as it tends to hide a bit under\nthe planet. Perhaps the next software release could include a list\nof lit Crime Scenes, and the current level, in the status report.\n\nMultiball\n\nKnock down the 'JUDGE' drop targets to light lock. This is an unmistakable\nevent, as flashers start flashing (not as bad as CFBL) and the planet\nstarts to rotate. Shoot the left ramp, and the ball will be diverted\nto the planet. Check out the ball locked animation. A new ball is\nserved to the plunger before the other-one is even in the planet,\nso there are no delays there. [Note: a soft shot up the ramp when\nlock isn't lit, can cause the ball to end up at the planet. The problem\nwith this is that the timers for a Link don't stop, and it takes a\nwhile for the ball to be unlocked.]\n\n\nBecause of the Deadworld changes, release ROMs do the locking\ndifferently.  Now, \"locks\" 1 and 2 just sail around the the ramp.  The\n3rd ball will indeed be diverted to the Deadworld, and if the Claw\ncan't get the ball out, it falls onto the playfield rather ungracefully.\nAfter starting Multiball with the 3rd shot, 3 more balls are autoplunged\ninto play.\n\nThe jackpot value starts at either 20 or 25M (not sure).  Each drop\ntarget hit adds 1M to the jackpot.  Shoot the left ramp to light the\njackpot, and hit the Subway (scoop behind the \"D\" target) to collect.\n\nCollecting a jackpot does NOT reset the value; it just keeps growing and\ngrowing.\n\n\nThere are 4 jackpots, each 5 million more than the previous. The\ncurrent jackpot is indicated on the playfield, as either Mortis, Fire,\nFear or Death will flash. The order on the playfield is wrong, and\nthe jackpots occur in the order given above. The quotes are good,\ntaunting the player to score the jackpot; although the feminine computer\nvoice keeps saying \"Shoot left Ramp to light Jackpot\" all the time\n. grrr.\n\n\nI don't think collecting the jackpot adds anything to the value, but I'm\nnot sure.\n\n\nThe jackpot animations are really nice.\n\nAfter the Death Jackpot, Ultimate Challenge starts. Any balls that\nyou lost up until that point are re-launched. Ie: If you only have\n2 balls left in play when you score the Death Jackpot, 2 more will\nbe launched.\n\nMultiball/Ultimate Challenge end when less that 2 balls remain in\nplay.\n\nWhen starting a second multiball, 'JUDGE' must be completed for each\nlock. Although for the second and third locks, the machine gives you\na few letters for free. Unlike FishTales/Indiana Jones, Jackpots are\nnot held between multiballs. So if you just missed getting Death,\nyou need to start from the beginning again. Personally, I think this\nis a bit rough!\n\nMisc. Things\n\n\nSkill Shot  The ball is launched into the Large loop, so when it\ngets around to the upper left flipper, go for another large loop.\nThe skill shot scores 5 Million, and the quote 'Great Shot', (even\nthough it sounds like Great Scott!).\n\nTwo way combo  Left orbit -> Small loop for 6 million.\n\n\nI think it's only 3M for the 2-way combo.\n\n\n\nThree Way Combo  Left orbit -> Small loop -> Centre ramp for 6 Million.\nShooting unlit ramps will award 500k * number of ramp shots that ball. So\nany ramp is worth 500k 1 Million, 1.5 Million, 2 Million etc..\n\n\nI guess this is the part you're all waiting for:\n\nRules: \nThe player is greeted politely by Annita Mann at the start of a\nSuper Game, and is told that they have the Drain Shield active for\n10 seconds. The machine waits for a ball to be launched, and then\nlaunches a second one.\n\nThere are four different, and seemingly unrelated Super Games. All\nof them are two ball, but draining 1 reverts to normal play for the\nremainder of that ball. One game is played per ball.\n\nHowever, if you hit the JUDGE drop targets within 15 seconds, you start\na 6 ball frenzied multiball. Confused yet?...\n\n\nThere's no time limit on the JUDGE thing, AFAIK.  All you need to do is\nget JUDGE before you have <2 balls in play.\n\n\n\nGame 1  The player is given a quick story of what has happened, (in\nthis case a jail break).  Some Crime Scenes are lit, shoot them for\na 'Super Jackpot' of 52.5 million (There are seven Crime Scenes) and\na really nice animation. After a jackpot, some more Crime Scenes will\nbe lit for another Super Jackpot. This continues until less than 2\nballs remain.\n\nGame 2  A mad bomber has escaped and you need to stop him from the\nSniper Tower. Ramps build the Super Jackpot (7.5 Million each) from\n(I think) 7 Million; shoot the Sniper Tower to collect it. This continues\nuntil less than 2 balls remain.\n\n\nI think this game just scores 7.5M/ramp, no base.  If there IS a base, it\nis 7.5M.  You have to collect it of course.\n\n\n\nGame 3  There is a terrible traffic-jam. Shot the Subway for 25 Million,\nPerhaps it's 10 Million + 5 Million per down target the 'Move Your\nCar' quote, and some brilliantly violent animation; (See the spoilers).\nThere is no Super Jackpot in this game. This continues until less\nthan 2 balls remain. The drop targets reset between jackpots.\n\n\nThe scoring for this game is simply 5M*targets, for a maximum of 25M.  The\ndrop targets only reset when you've made a Subway shot.\n\n\n\nGame 4  The object is to try and destroy Dead World. Locking 2 balls causes\nthe shields to come down, and locking the third blows up the planet\nfor a Super Jackpot of 45 Million. This repeats. As soon as a ball is\nlocked, it gets unlocked by the crane, so when I say 'locking the\nthird' I mean virtual locks, OK?\n\n\nIn all Super Games(tm)(c)(r)(pty)(ltd)(sdtm)(etc) there is a chance to\nscore a super jackpot of 100 million. Shoot four lit crime scenes in order,\nfirst a 'warning' (it's on the display) then Misdemeanor, Felony and then\nClass X Felony. Now one of the top shots (it varies between Sniper/Ramp etc)\nwill be lit for the 100 Million - But it's only lit for 10 seconds, the\ncomputer voice counts it down - By the time it gets to '1', it has an\namazingly smug tone to it too!\n\n\nThe 100M Super Jackpot has nothing to do with Crime Scenes.  All it is is\nthe Advance Crime Scene target.  Hit it 4 times to light the 100M.  It's\nalways the same shot for each game, but I don't remember what they all are\noffhand.  I think it's the Sniper Tower for the Traffic Jam SuperGame.\n\nYou don't need to be in 6-ball or anything to get the 100M.  I've lit (and\ncollected) the 100M in 2-ball play, while failing to get JUDGE at all.  :|\n\n\nIn a 5 ball game, you get the following:\n\n\n ball 1 : game 1\n ball 2 : game 2\n ball 3 : game 3\n ball 4 : game 4\n ball 5 : game 1\n\n\nExtra Ball Buy-Ins\nIn a regular game, the bought extra ball starts multiball, so it's\na little fairer than Twilight Zone and Indiana Jones, as multiball\ncan lead to jackpots (i.e. replays) or extra balls.\n\nIn a Super Game, game 4 starts.\n\nGeneral Stuff\nThe 'Family Mode' default is 'No'.\n\nThe sound is good. Some annoying quotes (not as bad as 'Shoot the\nSnackbar!), but I started to ignore them after a while so they were\nok. But putting the sound aside, I thought the animation was fantastic.\nIt wasn't just that the animation LOOKED good, it was actually clever.\n\nThe Match Sequence is fantastic. It's a little long (and I never actually\nsaw it Match), but it's great. See the spoilers if you want a better\ndescription, but you really should wait!\n\nNo cows that I could see .. sorry.\n\nThat about covers it. I really like the game (so far) and I think\nthat it has some really good features, it is certainly 100% more playable\nthan Indiana Jones, and seems a heck-of-a-lot more light hearted than\nTwilight Zone. It's good to see that the design crew has a bit of\na sence of humor!\n\nStrategy\nOK, there isn't all that much strategy per se, but here are a couple\nhints:\n\nKNOW YOUR MODES!  By doing this, you can maximize your effectiveness for\nmode scoring.  Modes can be worth an awful lot if you bother to play\nthem.  I don't think you'll do very well at all if you don't, especially\nbecause the only other thing you can do during a mode is shoot for\nmultiball (well, Crime Scenes too), and multiball can easily be worth\nnothing if you goof it up.  Here are some ideas:\n\n\nSniper   Only start this mode from the Sniper Tower.  You waste time (and\nthus points) if you start it from the ramp.\n\nManhunt Millions   Similarly, only start this from the left ramp.  Then\nyou can just shoot this over and over and over again.  I usually don't\nworry about trying to extend the mode via the ? target if I'm on a roll.\n\nMeltdown   I prefer to start this from the ramp so that I can (hopefully)\nshoot the ? right away to end the mode.\n\n\nI usually don't try to do much with Bad Impersonator.  Seems kind of\ndangerous to me.\n\nThe other modes depend on my mood.  I sometimes play them if I've made\nthe first shot or 2.  Otherwise, I'll go for Crime Scenes.\n\nI save both Safecracker and Blackout until after the first multiball.  It\nis much easier to spell JUDGE during these modes, either by flailing\nduring Blackout, or shooting the Subway over and over during Safecracker.\n\nDuring Ultimate Challenge, try to get balls on the right flipper.  You\ncan then exploit the Sniper Tower for 10M/shot with the left flipper (since\nSniper feeds the left flipper).\n\nSpoilers\nWARNING:\nLook at these at your own risk. The only information contained in\nthis document are full animations/sounds which are even funnier if\nexperienced during play.\n\n\nSniper Quotes  The animation shows the guy falling from the Sniper\nTower. As he falls, he sometimes says \"It's a looong way down! ..\nAhhhhh\", or \"Hey! You can see my house from here!\". When you shoot the\nSniper Tower to recollect the value, he will splatter all over a wire\nfence... Hit the red buttons to see a dog wonder up, sniff the remains,\nand lift his leg - accompanied by a soft tinkling sound!\n\nSafe Cracker  The first attempt to wake the guy up is with a Machine\ngun. Then a tank destroys everything but the safe and the guy. (The\nguy even has little 'Zzzz's as he sleeps!). Then a machine that I'm\nnot even going to begin to try and describe, attempts - no luck. Finally\nhe's blasted upon from outa-space. This wakes him up and he opens\nthe safe. There is a steaming roast Turkey (or chicken) in there!\nThe guy just smiles! If you press the red buttons here the guy gets\nzapped by lightning. Very funny, and very graphic; I still laugh at\nhis smoking remains!\n\nStake Out  Judge Dredd first sees the silhouette of a guy and girl come\ntogether, then fall onto a bed (out of view), knocking over a lamp. He\nmumbles something like \"I wonder what's going on there!\", or \"Hmmmm\ninteresting!\".  Next he sees the silhouette of the girl stand up and\nunfasten her bra.  She then closes the blind!\n\nUltimate Challenge  Not the wizard bonus one would expect. All Crime\nscenes are lit for 10 million, and all of the balls in the trough\nget launched (the ones in lock remain there). Just keep getting 10\nmillions. It ends when less than two balls remain in play. I don't\nthink there was anything for getting all of the Crime Scenes (they\nremain lit once you hit them), but I could be wrong. With 4-6 balls\nin play, this can lead to a monstrous score!\n\n\nWell, there are 2 ways to get Ultimate Challenge:  Getting all 4\nregular multiball jackpots, and by finishing all of the modes.  For\nthe multiball UC, it is 4-ball.  For the mode UC, it is 6-ball.\n\n\n\nSuper Game (Game 3)  There are two guys (one behind an other) in\na big traffic jam. The first jackpot sees the guy behind yell \"Move\nYour Car\" and shoot a machine gun; but you actually get to see the\nguy in front get hit! The second time he has a acid gun (like a water\npistol, but it says 'Acid' on the side). He fires, and you see the\nhead of the guy in front melt to a skull. Finally, he throws an axe,\nwhich flies through the air and hits the front guy in the back of\nthe head. This is accompanied by a 'Uhh' sound, and a brain being\nsplattered over the wind-screen! It's great!\n\nMatch Sequence: The display shows an old lady in a rocking chair in front\nof a house. A car full of people drive past shooting. The old-lady falls\nto the ground. When the car has past, she gets up with her trusty ole\ndouble barrel and shoots three times. Each shot causes come of the display\nto be blown away. The last shot reveals the match numbers. The music is\ngreat as well ...\n\nSquirt Fatality When Judge Dredd announces \"get the extra ball\", the display\nshows him talking into a C.B. Hit the red buttons and the CB squirts water\ninto his face. JD responds with \"hmmmm, interesting.\"\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n Keefer's comments changed to blockquotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Judge Dredd", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/judgedredd.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Judge Dredd", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Curves a bit clockwise from bottom to top.\n\n1 Standup\nof the \"1-2-3-4-5\" standup targets. Complete the series for\n\"double scoring\" where everything on the playfield doubles.\n\nL-O-R-D\na pachinko-like arangement that uses up about 1/3 of the upper\nplayfield real estate. When the ball is caught in either saucer, a mini\nball is kicked out and will fall in to one of four lanes. Complete spelling\n\"L-O-R-D\" to start multi-ball.\n\n\"Double Trouble\"\na five-bank of drop targets. Rules below.\n\nUpper saucer\na ball saucer off to the upper right corner of the\nplayfield. Catch it here to kick the mini ball and attempt to spell\nL-O-R-D.\n\nSlingshot\na slingshot kicker.\n\nLane\nthe ball is launched from the plunger, up a scoop, and on to the\nupper playfield. It comes out via this lane and is fed more or less to the\nupper right flipper.\n\nLower saucer\nanother ball saucer. Same rules as the upper one.\n\nRight ramp\nSimilar to the left ramp, but curved counter-clockwise, bottom\nto top. It ends at the Lower saucer.\n\nCentre ramp\nbetween the flippers. Slightly curved, but essentially\nstraight.\n\n\n\nLower Playfield\n\n\nFlippers\ntwo normal flippers, about where you'd expect to find them.\n\nLeft slingshot\na regular slingshot\n\nLeft inlane\nan inlane, feeding to the left flipper. The rollover enables\nthe Lower Loop to increment the Bonus X, and the Lower Saucer on the upper\nplayfield for two kicks of the mini ball. The rollover is also the \"4\" in\nthe \"1-2-3-4-5\" series.\n\nLeft outlane\nnormal outlane. Can be lit for \"drain shield\" via the Lower\nLoop.\n\nLeft magnasave\nThere are extra \"flipper\" type buttons on the cabinet that\ncan be used to save the ball via an electromagnet mounted under the\nplayfield. Up to five magnasaves can be stacked and used.\n\nLeft Drop Target bank\na 3-bank of drop targets. Dropping a target adds a\nmagnasave to the left side. It also starts a timer. Completing the bank\nbefore the timer expires spots one letter for L-O-R-D.\n\nLower Loop (left)\nThe left entrance to the Lower Loop. This goes under\nthe upper playfield, around the Left Ramp. Completing the loop via the left\nentrance turns on the ball saver.\n\nLeft Ramp\nleads to the upper playfield.\n\n2 Standup\nanother standup target, part of the \"1-2-3-4-5\" series.\n\nLower Loop (right)\nThe right entrance to the Lower Loop. Completing the\nloop from the right entrance, when lit, adds a Bonus X multiplier.\n\nCentre Ramp\nto the upper playfield.\n\n3 Standup\nanother standup target, part of the \"1-2-3-4-5\" series.\n\nRight Ramp\nto the upper playfield, Lower Saucer.\n\nRight Drop Target Bank\nanother 3-bank of drop targets. Same as the Left\nones, but adds a magnasave to the right side. Complete to spot \"L-O-R-D\"\nletters.\n\nRight outlane\nnormal outlane, can be lit for \"drain shield\" by the Lower\nLoop.\n\nRight magnasave\nlike the left one, a magnet you can use to try so save\nthe ball.\n\nRight inlane\nlike the left one. Is the \"5\" in the \"1-2-3-4-5\" series.\nEnables the Lower Loop for Bonus X, but does not enable the Lower Saucer on\nthe upper playfield for two mini ball kicks.\n\n\n\nGameplay\nJungle Lord has two primary scoring features, multi-ball, and Double\nTrouble.\n\nMulti-Ball\nTo start two-ball multi-ball, the player must spell L-O-R-D on\nthe upper mini-playfield area. This can be done by catching the ball in\neither ball saucer on the upper playfield to fire the \"mini-ball\" which\nwill randomly get a letter from the pachinko arrangement, or by completing\none of the two sets of lower drop targets. The lower drop targets have a\ntimer, so that once one target is hit, only a few seconds are allowed\nbefore the bank is reset and the player has to try again. Completing a drop\ntarget bank spots one letter toward L-O-R-D. Once L-O-R-D has been\ncompleted, the player can lock one ball in either upper ball saucer to\nstart multi-ball. The second ball is fed to the plunger, and a 35-second\ntimer is started. During the 35-second timer, the player must spell L-O-R-D\nagain, but can regain a drained ball by locking the remaining ball in one\nof the ball saucers again.\n\n\nDouble Trouble\nTo start this feature, the player must complete the upper\ndrop target bank five times, with different targets being raised for each\ntime that the bank must be completed. Once Double Trouble is started, it\ncarries over from ball to ball. For Double Trouble, a single drop target is\nraised on the upper target bank, and a timer is started. Hitting that drop\ntarget within the timer scores 10K points, and raises another target. Each\ntime the player manages to hit the raised target, without the timer\nexpiring, the awarded score doubles (20K, 40K, 80K, 160K). If the timer\nexpires, though, the currently raised target is lowered, the awarded score\nresets to 10K, and a new target is raised. Doing well in this feature,\nespecially when combined with multi-ball and double scoring can lead to\nvery high scores.\n\n\nMagna-Save\nThe lower left and right banks of drop targets, when a target\nis dropped, award a \"Magna-Save\" to the player. Up to five, per side, can\nbe collected and used. There are two large electromagnets mounted under the\nplayfield in a place where the player can use them to save a ball from\ndraining down the outlanes. There is an extra flipper type button on each\nside of the game that activates these Magna-Save magnets when pressed.\n\n\nSounds and Speech\nLike other 1980s games, Jungle Lord features those cool 80s Williams sound\neffects, and rudimentary speech with several phrases. They are clear enough\nto be understood, things like \"FIGHT JUNGLE TIGER AND WIN!\". There is also\na bell, and a buzzer, used for more sound effects.\n\n\nOpinion\nI really like some parts of this game. The \"Double Trouble\" feature on the\nupper drop target bank is a cool idea and a lot of fun to shoot for.\nMulti-ball is pretty good, with an actual goal (spell L-O-R-D for special),\nand a time limit. The multiple levels, in multi-ball, especially with\nDouble Trouble running, is a lot of fun. The magnasaves are cool, and\nfrustrating; overall I don't think that they actually help the player, but\nthey do give the illusion of control.\n\n\nOn the down side, the L-O-R-D pachinko game thing uses up a lot of space\nand isn't all that useful. They'd have done better with another drop target\nbank or some other thing over there to keep the ball in play, instead of\ncatching the ball in a saucer and waiting for the mini ball to drop.\n\n\nAs it is, my Jungle Lord is a lot of fun, but there is one design feature\nthat I'd have done differently.\n\n\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n\n\nHTML converted by Kevin Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Jungle Lord", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/junglelord.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Jungle Lord", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Junkyard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Junkyard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Williams pinball machine released in January 1997\n(prototypes seen as early as November 1996)\nVersion 0.4\n\n\nThis rulesheet was written by /dev/joe (Joseph DeVincentis),\nThanks to Mike Morrey, Andrew Norrish,\n\"klex\", Dwight Sullivan, Rob Rosenhouse, Greg Rosen, Matt Magnasco,\nand everybody on r.g.p for helping out.\n\nChanges since v0.3:\n\n Added \"Six Million Dollar Man\" in Run From Spike.\n Added some more explanations/info in the skill shot, time machine,\nball recycle, adventures, and references to other games.\n Added Greg Rosen's \"Secret Mania\" on Time Machine.\n Added multiball restart + confirmed last chance super jackpots.\n Noted that the autofire light isn't always lit when autofire is.\n Noted that the unused \"magnet\" under the crane is not present on\nproduction games.\n Added Midnight Madness.\n Added strategy section.\n\n\nWeb Page\nhttp://www.pinball.wms.com/games/junkyard/index.html\nWilliams has a web page for this game; you can see pictures of the\nplayfield and some of the game rules are described here as well.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nThere are two standard flippers and standard return lanes in the usual\npositions.  The inlanes can be lit to start Crane Hurry-up.  The outlanes\nhave quite large openings, and each outlane can be lit separately for a\n\"Ball Recycle\".\n\nAbove the left out/inlanes there is a popper which returns the ball to the\nleft inlane.  Most of the shots that take balls under the playfield\nreturn the ball here.\n\nOn the playfield beside this device is a bank of three standup targets\nwith blue lights in the playfield in front of them, which, when completed,\nlights the left outlane Recycle.\n\nAbove this there are two ramps with entrance side-by-side.  The far left\nramp leads to a toilet, which counts the spins the ball takes inside it\nbefore falling under the playfield.  The inner ramp carries the ball around\nthe back of the playfield toward a VW bus in the back right corner; a\ndiverter can cause the ball to be temporarily held here or to return\ndirectly on a habitrail to the right inlane.  This ramp also has an open\nside which allows slow shots to fall through to an area not otherwise\naccessible, which dribbles down into the hole in front of the dog.\nLights in front of these ramps indicate various available shots.\n\nIn the center of the top of the playfield is this game's main feature.\nThe \"Crane\" is a pinball hanging from a chain. (The test games instead\nhave a metal rod or cable about 1/2 mm in diameter, which Williams\nsuggests to replace with the chain.  The game I play has the rod, which\nis now bent.)  The chain hangs from a bar (which is decorated to look\nlike a crane) that goes into the back wall of the game.  This ball can\nbe raised or lowered, to allow the pinball to pass under it, or block\nits path.  The bar itself can move side-to-side and up-and-down slightly,\nin addition to the wild motion the ball has.\n\nAround this, arranged in a semicircle, are 2 banks of 3 standup targets\nwith an opening for another shot (which goes around a corner and under\nthe playfield) between them.  Above these there is a row of 5 larger\n\"car\" standup targets, with no gap.  The crane ball can be hit into\nthese higher targets.  Several lights in front of the crane ball\nindicate shots available on the crane ball (by hitting it into the car\nstandups) or in the opening behind it.  There doesn't seem to be a name\nfor this opening (in some mode, I forget which, the game calls it the\nalley, but the playfield calls the DOG scoop the alley), so I will call\nit the center shot.\n\nBelow the right side crane standups there is an up-scoop which usually\ndrops the ball onto the bus ramp's habitrail to the right inlane, but\na diverter can send it to the dog instead.  The dog is a decoration\njust in front of the bus; when the ball goes to him, it falls into a\nhole in the playfield in front of him, and if the ball was supposed\nto be there, a video mode starts.  Lights in front of the scoop spell\nout D-O-G.  Just to the left of it there is a small standup target,\nthe Toaster Gun target.\n\nBelow and slightly to the right of the scoop entrance, there is a\nsinkhole called the Sewer that can be entered from almost any direction.\nLights in front of it indicate a variety of awards which can be available\nhere, including Extra Ball and Adventures.  The adventures themselves\nare indicated by a separate row of lights across the playfield, below\nthe lights for the ramps, crane, and scoop.\n\nBelow the Sewer there is a bank of 3 blue standups; these light the right\noutlane Recycle and are similar to their counterparts on the other side\nof the playfield.\n\nThe plunger (which is a combination manual and autoplunger) shoots the\nball through a spinner and into a sinkhole, which, like other holes\non this game, takes the ball to the left inlane feed.\n\nJunk\nIn the middle of the lower section of the playfield, in addition to\nlights for \"shoot again\" and autofire, there is a blueprint with 10\ndifferent pieces of junk marked with lights.  Some of the pieces\ncombine to make various contraptions.\n\nThe junk consists of:  Hair dryer, toaster, cuckoo clock, television,\nweathervane, fishbowl, propeller, fan, bathtub, and bicycle wheels.\nThe game begins with the toaster already awarded.\n\nThe combinations are:\n\n Hair dryer + toaster = toaster gun\n television + weathervane = radar\n bicycle wheels + bathtub + fan = jalopy\n fishbowl + jalopy = submerger\n propeller + jalopy = flying machine\n\n\nThere is an extra ball awarded for collecting a certain amount of junk,\nwhich is on a percentage; on the game I play it's awarded on the third\njunk item.\n\nCollecting all the junk lets you enter your initials as junk champion at\nthe end of the game.  The current junk champion's initials are shown on\nSpike's collar when each dog video mode begins.\n\nHelpful hints\nAt various times during the game, an angel appears on the left of the DMD\nor a devil appears on the right, and they make some comment.  Whenever\nyou collect junk, one or both of them appears and advises you what to\ncollect next.  (If your first junk item is anything other than the hair\ndryer, both appear, the angel advising you to get the hair dryer and the\ndevil advising you to get a part for the radar.)  One of these also\nannounces each time an invention is completed, or when an adventure\nstarts.\n\nEnd-of-ball bonus\nAt the end of each ball, you get a bonus which consists of some amount\nfor each item of junk (varies from about 10K to 25K for different pieces),\nplus bonuses for completed contraptions (which replace the individual\nparts in the bonus count), plus 25K per Fireworks collected, plus some\namount for each mode played.  If you get to Outer Space, the Fireworks\nreset and the junk bonus is replaced by 250K for outer space, plus an\nextra 250K if you defeat Bob.  All this is then multiplied by the bonus\nmultiplier, which starts at 1x but can be increased by skill shots and\notherwise, and is cumulative throughout the game.  The multiplier maxes\nat 6x; when you do something that would normally advance it further,\nyou get 250,000 points awarded instead.\n\nThe bonus count is slow, giving you time to look at all the pictures of\nstuff Williams filled the ROMs with, but you can speed it up by holding\ndown the flippers (just pressing both doesn't do it).\n\nSkill Shot\nThe skill shot consists of 5 possible awards on the DMD; one will be lit.\nEach spin the spinner on the plunger lane takes advances the lit award.\nThe spinner on my machine is either flaky or rigged, because the spinner\nalways stops with the same side showing (one side has a dog, the other\nan explosion), but I've seen the skill shot advance an odd number of\ntimes often.  The first skill shot always has these awards in this order:\nCollect Junk, Super Skill Shot, Collect Junk, Bonus x2, and Collect Junk.\nLater other awards usually take the place of some of these.  Here are the\neffects of the skill shot awards:\n\n\n Collect Junk  awards the flashing Junk item.  The left flipper advances\nthe lit item counterclockwise so you can choose which one you want if\nyou plan in advance.  There are other ways to collect Junk that work the\nsame way.\n\n Super Skill Shot  the Sewer is lit for a short time for 250,000 points.\nIf you hit it in time, the timer resets and it is worth 500,000 the\nnext time, then 750,000, etc. up to 2.5 million.\n\n Bonus X  The bonus multiplier is applied to the total end-of-ball bonus\nand is cumulative throughout the game.  There are other ways to\nadvance the bonus multiplier as well.  See End-of-Ball Bonus.\n\n Light Extra Ball  Does exactly that.  The sewer is lit for extra ball\nuntil it is collected.  All extra balls on this game stack, and stay\nlit even if you lose the ball.  Sometimes if you miss this award, it\nwill be in two slots (or more) the next skill shot.\n\n Spot D-O-G  awards all the D-O-G letters on the scoop and lights it\nfor video mode.\n\n 50,000 or 100,000 or other numbers  Scores that many points.  This is\naccompanied by EM-style bell sounds.\nIn games when I had already collected all the junk, and gotten several\nextra balls, the skill shot would have 4 or even all 5 of the awards\njust be points.  I've seen 150K, 250K, and 500K in this situation.\n\n Fireworks  Adds 1 to your count of fireworks collected, which is\ncumulative throughout the game.\n\n Shopping  Awards Window Shopping (see below)\n\n Light Time  Lights the Sewer for Time Machine.\n\n Others?  \n\n\nBall Recycle and Autofire\nThe outlanes can be lit (separately) for Ball Recycle.  When a ball drains\nin a lit outlane, the ball is returned to the plunger, and you get another\nskill shot, and any modes which were going before continue.  Ball Recycles\ndo not time out; they are lit until collected, and collecting one does not\nturn off the other.\n\nAutofire is lit for a short time at the start of each ball, for a longer\ntime at the start of each multiball mode, and sometimes by a random award.\nAny ball that drains is returned to the plunger and auto-launched, and\neverything continues.  It seems that the autofire light doesn't light up\nwhen autofire is lit at the start of each ball.\n\nI don't know what happens if both are lit when the ball drains.\n\nWindow Shopping\nThis can be awarded from the Skill Shot, or the toilet ramp.\nArrows on the DMD draw your attention to a set of windows in a building\non the backglass; a light flashes randomly in the windows, and you\npress both flippers to stop the light and win the lit award:\n\n\n Light Extra Ball \n\n Free Game \n\n Light Jackpot   The crane ball rises, and the center shot is lit for a\njackpot, which starts at 1 million, but some things can add to the value\nof this jackpot.  This award also stays lit until collected.\n\n Collect Fireworks  Adds 3 to your Fireworks collected.\n\n Toxic Waste  Nothing happens.\n\n\nGreat Toilet\nEach spin the ball takes in the toilet adds 1000 points to the toilet\njackpot, which is cumulative over the game.  The toilet can also be lit\nfor Window Shopping, or Choose Junk (which lets you choose any one of\nthe 10 junk items you don't already have).  It is also one of the\nfive major shots for some modes.\n\nMagic Bus\nThis is the second of the five major shots used in some modes.\nThe bus ramp may be lit for Collect Junk, and/or Magic Bus.  Each shot\nthrough the bus ramp also adds one Bus Ride, and various awards are\ngiven at certain numbers of Bus Rides.  When it is lit for Magic Bus,\nthe ball will be held at the top of the playfield, and an animation\nfollows, with five awards shown, and then one of these is awarded.\nMost of the awards are pretty self-explanatory.  The awards are:\n\n\n Big Points  500,000 points.\n\n Light Extra Ball \n\n Light Jackpot \n\n Light Multiball  Multiball is lit at the center shot, as if MULTIBALL\nhad been completed.\n\n Light Recycle  Lights just one of the two Recycles.\n\n Collect Junk \n\n DOG video mode  plays a video mode as if you had shot the scoop when lit.\n\n Advance Bonus X \n\n Autofire  turns on the ball saver for a short time\n\n Light Time Machine \n\n All of the above  when this appears, it is always the last item on the\nlist, and it does sometimes get awarded.\n\n\nD-O-G scoop\nThis is the third of the five major shots used in some modes.\nWhen D-O-G isn't lit, hitting this adds a letter to D-O-G.\nWhen D-O-G is lit, the diverter at the scoop sends the ball to the dog\ninstead of returning it on the habitrail, and a video mode begins.\n\nIf you haven't completed the toaster gun yet, the mode is \"Run from Spike\".\nPress the flipper buttons rapidly to help your character run faster and\nescape from the dog.  Rob Rosenhouse says if you manage to run fast enough\nin this mode, your characters gets \"streaks of speed\" on the screen as if\nhe was running really fast, and a \"bionic\" sound effect like the Six\nMillion Dollar Man.\n\nIf you have completed the gun, you play \"Save the Girl\" instead.  A wall\nis shown with two openings, and the girl (only legs shown) runs back and\nforth behind the wall, chased by the dog.  The left and right flipper\nbuttons shoot toast at the respective openings.  You need to hit the dog\n3 times in 12 seconds to win the mode.  You also have a limited amount\nof ammo, which seems to be a minimum of 12 for the first time you play\nSave the Girl, but it can be more if you've collected more toast during\nthe game.\n\nIf you have completed one of these games previously, it gets harder when\nyou play them again, later -- in Save the Girl, the girl and dog start\ntaking erratic patterns, sometimes with the girl chasing the dog!\nCompleting a video mode collects an item of junk, or awards 3 Fireworks\nif you have already collected all the junk.\n\nSewer\nThis is the fourth of the five major shots used in some modes.\nThe sewer can be lit for several different awards.\n\n\n Toast   Adds 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 pieces of toast to your collection, and\nawards 10,000 points per piece of toast awarded.\n\n Extra Ball  accompanied by an animation of the words Extra Ball on the DMD.\n\n Time Machine  Starts one of five modes, see below.\n\n Start Adventure  Starts the first lit adventure, see below.\n\n\n\nThe Crane\nIn normal play, each time the crane ball hits one of the car targets\na letter is added to MULTIBALL.  Also completing either bank of lower\nstandup targets adds a letter to MULTIBALL, and completing both banks\nlights the return lanes for Crane Hurry-up.  Normally the crane is\nlowered, blocking the center shot, but if the ball manages to go in there\nanyway, the \"sneak in\" awards some points and 3 MULTIBALL letters.\nCompleting MULTIBALL raises the crane and lights Multiball at the center\nshot, and a siren goes off to let you know it is lit.\n\nCrane Hurry-up\nThe hurry-up starts at 50,000 and counts down to 25,000 where it remains\nfor a while before the mode ends.  Hitting the crane ball into any car\ntarget collects the value and starts crane multiball, a 2-ball multiball.\nEach hit of a car standup or the lower crane standups is accompanied by a\nglass-breaking sound and scores the amount of points the crane hurry-up\nended at.\n\nMultiball\nWhen multiball starts, there is a long animation, and the other balls\nare auto-launched.  After the first half of the animation, when you go\npast the gate the rest can be aborted by hitting both flipper buttons.\nThe crane ball is raised and the center shot is lit for jackpot.\nAfter 1 jackpot, the crane ball is lowered, and the center shot is lit\nfor super jackpot, 3 million points.  After a super jackpot, you can keep\ntrying for more super jackpots.  When the next-to-last ball drains and\nthe mode ends, if super jackpot was lit the crane will lift for a\nmoment, and you (might) have a clear shot for a Super Jackpot during the\ngrace period -- this is not indicated in any way, besides the crane lifting,\nuntil you hit the shot.  If super jackpot wasn't lit (that is, you never\ngot the first jackpot) the center shot lights for a multiball restart\ninstead.\n\nA lot of stuff is turned off during multiball, including starting adventures,\nvideo mode, and just about anything that would normally hold the ball.\nHowever, it is possible to start multiball during some of the adventures;\nI've done it several times on the Radar adventure, and Matt Magnasco reports\ndoing it in the Great Toilet adventure.  When this happens, multiball and\nthe adventure run simultaneously, with the adventure ending as normal\nwhen time runs out or you complete the 5 shots needed to finish the mode.\n\nTime Machine\nThis is one of the most fun awards in this game.  Time Machine can be\nlit by the skill shot or Magic Bus, and is also lit when you collect the\nCuckoo Clock junk item, and is collected at the Sewer.  A control panel\nappears on the DMD with the current date and time (32 days slow in the\ncase of the game I play) and then it flashes and changes to another date,\nwhich seems to be one to several months after the release date of another\ngame, which the mode is taken from. (Maybe it's the end of the production\nrun?  TAF is a March 1992 game according to the pinball database, but\n12-14-92 is used here.)  All these modes are timed on a fairly short timer.\nThese dates are taken from Mike Morrey's post; I haven't checked them\nmyself.  In the Mamushka and Payback Time modes, the voices are faked,\nundoubtedly due to not having the contractual rights to reuse the\noriginal voice tracks in another game.\n\n\n01-13-93 Move Your Car mode from Creature from the Black Lagoon:\nShoot the center shot over and over again for increasingly large point\nawards, and more time.\n\n08-31-91 Payback Time mode from Terminator 2: All the 5 major shots\nare lit for 1 million each, with a 10 million bonus for hitting all 5.\nThis is easily the highest scoring award here.  According to the\nWilliams web page, this has been removed because it was out of balance\nwith the rest of the game.\n\n12-14-92 The Mamushka mode from Addams Family: All shots are lit for\n100,000? points each.\n\n02-14-99 Knight Mission mode: Dwight Sullivan (Wms project leader for\nJunk Yard) says this is not a Black Knight 2000 reference; the mode\ndoesn't really resemble anything from that game anyway.  Maybe it's\nreally a reference to a game planned for the future?  That would be\ncool. :-)  The center shot is lit for increasing awards, which are\nalso added to the multiball jackpot.(?)  This mode has the shortest\ntimer of all; if you don't hit the first shot within about 5 seconds\nit turns off; if you hit the shot you get more time.\n\n10-31-95 Saucer Attack video mode from Attack from Mars:\nFlying saucers descend in five columns, somewhat randomly arranged, and\nyour gun is below the middle column, firing continuously, and the angle\nof the gun can be changed by holding either flipper.  According to\nAndrew Norrish, sometimes the saucers can be replaced by cows by\ndoing the right thing, but he didn't know what.  According to some\nposts to r.g.p, the \"cheat\" that can be performed by hitting the\nlaunch button in AfM is available with the start button in Junk Yard,\nbut this may not be in the prototype roms.  There is disagreement over\nwhether an extra ball can be awarded as well.\n\n\nGreg Rosen posted that there is a Secret Mania when the Time Machine clock\nshows 3:33 by hitting both flippers.\n\nAdventures\nThere are five adventures: Radar Adventure, The Great Jalopy Race, The\nGreat Toilet Adventure, Air Tactical Combat, and Outer Space.\nThe first four of these are lit just by having collected the junk\nrequired to build the Radar, Jalopy, Submerger, and Flying Machine,\nrespectively.  Outer Space is only lit when you complete the other\nfour adventures and have collected all the junk.  Whenever an adventure\nis lit, except during multiball and other adventures, the Sewer is lit\nfor Start Adventure.\n\nThe toaster gun target is lit during all adventures if you have\ncollected the junk to build the toaster gun; hitting it awards\nFireworks at a cost of 5 toast.  If you don't have enough toast,\nyou get a click (and the word CLICK in huge letters on the DMD).\n\nEach of the first four adventures is a long, timed, single-ball mode\n(though it is possible to start multiball during at least the Radar\nand Great Toilet adventures) and 5 specific shots are needed to\n\"win\" the mode and score a bonus.\n\nRadar Adventure\nSome of the major shots are lit; these change at random.  Each shot\nhit awards Fireworks.  The toaster gun target can also award fireworks\nas described above.  Collect 5 fireworks within the time limit to\nget a lot of points (how many?) and end the adventure.\n\nThe Great Jalopy Race\nAll 5 major shots are lit; shoot each one once in the time limit to finish.\nEach one is accompanied by an animation of your jalopy halfway-flying past\na \"checkpoint\" sign, and adds 1 to your fireworks.\n\nThe Great Toilet Adventure\nAll shots award the Great Toilet Jackpot (which starts at around 35,000, and\nincreases 1000 for each spin the ball makes in the toilet, cumulative\nthroughout the game, and it can increase during the adventure).  The Sewer\nand Great Toilet award Fireworks; collect 5 fireworks to finish.  The sound\neffects in this mode are great. :-)\n\nAir Tactical Combat\nHit the crane ball 5 times to finish.\n\nOuter Space\nYou get a bonus of 50,000 multiplied by the number of Fireworks you\ncollected, which is counted up on the display, followed by an extra\n10 million if you had at least 20.  Then there is an animation of a\nrocket blasting off and brief instructions.\n\nThe mode is a 4-ball multiball with continuous autofire.  The five\nmajor shots are lit, and go out when shot, but will be re-lit after\nsome time; clearing all 5 defeats Crazy Bob and ends the mode.\nWhen you hit one of the lit shots it scores over a million points;\nperhaps it's the multiball jackpot.  The toaster gun target and the\ncrane are lit for more Fireworks, but your fireworks run down over time.\nThe mode ends and Crazy Bob escapes when you run out of fireworks.\n\nWhen the mode ends, by either method, the flippers die and the game\ncollects all the balls and serves up a ball at the plunger.\nThe Fireworks and Adventures reset after Outer Space, but the Junk\ndoesn't; you can start playing the adventures again and presumably get\nto Outer Space again, but I haven't done it.\n\nStrategy\nThe biggest points in this game, by far, are in Multiball, the Adventures,\nand Outer Space.  Multiball is fairly easy to start, but once you get\ncomplete the Jalopy it is easier to collect the rest of the junk and\nplay the adventures.  After you complete Outer Space, all the adventures\nare lit so you can play through these 5 modes over and over.\n\nI first got good at Junk Yard when I learned to control the skill shot.\nA weak plunge will just give one or two spins, which is often exactly\nwhat you want -- I like to go for Collect Junk on the skill shot, to\nfinish the junk faster, or just to get to the extra ball faster if I'm\nhaving a bad game.\n\nThe two left ramps can be lit for collect junk and choose junk; typically\nyou should get each of these once and maybe the collect junk a second time\nin the course of completing the junk.\n\nNote that you can use the flippers to move the flashing junk item before\nplunging the ball, so those \"Collect Junk\" skill shot awards are as good\nas \"Choose Junk\".\n\nI try to avoid collecting the Hair Dryer junk item as long as possible,\nbecause it changes the video mode from \"Run from Spike\" to \"Save the Girl\".\n\"Save the Girl\" is more fun, but \"Run from Spike\" is easier, especially\ncompared to the later levels of \"Save the Girl\" (each time you complete\nit, it gets harder the next time), and completing it awards a junk item.\nObviously, you will eventually get the hair dryer.  \"Save the Girl\" starts\non level 1, no matter how many times you completed \"Run from Spike\".\n\nThe sewer is a very important shot on this game; it seems to be one\nthat is quite hard to hit, like the Final Draw on World Cup Soccer.\nIt's my opinion that the Super Skill Shot was done the way it is just\nto encourage players to practice this shot, because it is definitely\na shot worth practicing.  Adventures, Extra Ball, and Time Machine\nare all collected here, and some of the adventures will have the sewer\nlit as one of the shots (all except Air Tactical Combat).\n\nReferences to other games (In addition to the obvious Time Machine ones)\nOne of the sound effects is from Earthshaker.\n\nDuring Crane Hurry-up, the voice that says \"Come on, Hurry Hurry Hurry\"\nsounds like one of the voices from Dr. Dude (used for the Gift of Gab,\namong other things).\n\nThe Angel's voice is the same voice used in Safecracker, and both the\nAngel's picture and Devil's voice appear in Whodunnit?\n\nThe Super Jackpot animation is from HS2: The Getaway.\n\nI know there are more here that I'm missing.\n\nMatt Magnasco says it has a Midnight Madness (special mode that begins\nat midnight (if the game's clock is set correctly), interrupting\nwhatever else was going on, provided a game was being played at midnight.\n\nHidden/misc stuff\nWhenever you hit the crane into the car targets to add letters to\nmultiball, the DMD shows a big crash with a word in it like CRASH! or\nSQUISH!, etc.  One of these says DOHO!.\n\nI haven't seen any cows yet.  Somebody said saucer attack can sometimes,\nrandomly, be cow attack, like in AfM.\n\nThere appears to be a magnet directly under the crane, as if to help\nstop the crane ball when it is flying around wildly, but it appears to\nnot ever be used.  The production games don't have this.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Junkyard", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/junkyard.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Junkyard", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

It can\nbe modified, updated, or revised, provided only that credit to the original\nauthor(s) remains intact.  It can be published or otherwise distributed,\nprovided only that such distribution is effectively free.\n\nThis sheet is written and maintained by Kevin Martin\n- if you have any questions or comments or additions or\ncorrections, send 'em along to me.\n\nThis version of the Guide should be considered final.\n\n\"Jurassic Park\" is surely a trademark of some sort for Universal and Amblin,\nand the game design itself is the property of Data East.  The author(s)\ndisclaim all interest in any trademarks or other intellectual property\nreferenced herein.\n\nI use the abbreviations \"K\" for a thousand points, \"M\" for a million points,\nand \"B\" for a billion points.\n\nImportant Things\nThis is a glossary of the shots and features that will be referred to\nduring the discussion of the game.\n\n\nFlippers  There are three of these - the usual two lower ones, and an upper\nright full-length flipper.  The right flipper button can be used to control\nthe right flippers independently, with the second stage of button action\ncontrolling the upper flipper.  These are not the usual solid-state DE\nflippers; the new design is much less prone to getting loose and sloppy.\nHowever, it does appear to have difficulty with shots toward the tip of\nthe flipper, or shots against very fast-moving balls.\nPlunger  This is a gun handle, with a trigger for autolaunching balls into\nplay, and a large thumb button for the Smart Missile.  Balls are launched\ninto the Turbo Bumpers through a small gate, if properly aligned.\nBoat Dock  This is a saucer in the back right corner of the playfield, at\nthe end of a half orbit that passes in front of the upper right flipper.\nExtra Ball and Two-Ball can be lit here.\nPower Shed  This is a small rectangular sinkhole just above the upper right\nflipper.  It returns balls to the Right Inlane.  The Power Shed is also the\nS in CHAOS.\nRamp  The entrance to this ramp is just to the left of the Power Shed.  The\nramp runs across the back of the playfield, peaks in the back left corner,\nand can return to either Inlane by means of a diverter.  The right return\nis a habitrail; the left return is molded plastic.  Two consecutive Ramp\nshots will hold your Bonus over to the next ball.  The ramp is also the O\nin CHAOS.  The Ramp can light Mr. DNA (and Extra Balls under extreme\nconditions), and increases the T-Rex Bounty value.\nRaptor Pit  This is a narrow dead-end almost-vertical lane to the left of\nthe Ramp.  When a ball trips the rollover sensor in this lane, the ball is\nkicked towards the flippers at just under the speed of light.  During\nnormal single-ball play, a ball which drains immediately as a result of\nthis will be given back.  During Tri-Ball and Two-Ball, there is, quite\nreasonably, no such kindness.  The Danger light on the Raptor Pit indicates\nthat the ball saver is active (and also makes the Pit worth more).\nEgg  This is a captive ball to the left of the Raptor Pit.  When it is hit\nhard enough to reach the top of its lane (not very difficult), it registers\na hit on the Egg.\nT-Rex Paddock  This is a slightly lowered triangular area of the playfield\nto the left of the Egg and just above the Loop.  It is sunk into the\nplayfield no more than 1/4 inch.  Balls which go in here and don't bounce\nout will land in the T-Rex Saucer.\nT-Rex Saucer  When the ball lands here, T-Rex is fed.  The first time this\nSaucer is hit, the plastic T-Rex above the Paddock will come down and\nactually eat the ball, returning it to the Right Inlane.  Later hits will\nonly spot a letter in T-REX.  Completing T-REX awards the Bounty value and\ncauses T-Rex to eat the ball.  T-Rex will also eat the ball if Tri-Ball is\nlit or Feed T-Rex is running.\nHelicopter Pad  This loop is shot by the upper right flipper.  The ball\ntravels around the back of the game and feeds again to the upper right\nflipper.  Two consecutive Helipad shots hold the current Raptor Pit value\nover to the next ball.\nSpecies Targets  These small plastic targets are scattered across the\nplayfield, around the Turbo Bumpers Gate, below the Bunker Scoop, and above\nthe Right Outlane.  Completing them progresses towards lighting Tri-Ball.\nNote that the Spitter targets are in a bank directly beneath Hammond's\nBunker - these targets are used specifically in a few sequences.  The\nspecies targets are green for herbivores and red for carnivores.  Cute eh?\nTurbo Bumpers Gate  This is a one-way gate through which the ball enters the\nTurbo Bumpers when launched from the plunger.  The upper right flipper can\nalso direct the ball into the Turbo Bumpers through this gate.\nTurbo Bumpers  There are three of these in a normal triangular arrangement\nat the left side of the playfield, slightly more than halfway up.  The\nTurbo Bumpers increase the Park Revenue value and change the currently\nflashing Computer Screen, unless none remain or the Control Room is\ncurrently lit.\nControl Room  This is a wide rectangular scoop just below the Turbo Bumpers,\nto the right of the Visitor's Center shot, directly above the left flipper.\nIt awards Computer Screens, which are grid items.  Any ball entering here\nis ejected from Hammond's Bunker.  The Control Room is also the A in CHAOS.\nVisitor's Center  This is the left orbit, a shot which goes through the\nTurbo Bumpers and around the back of the game to the upper right flipper.\nThe Helipad and Visitor's Center shots share the same path along the back\nof the game.  The Visitor's Center is also the Advance X shot.  It is also\nthe H in CHAOS.  In many situations, credit is given for shooting the\nVisitor's Center just by getting the ball into the Jet Bumpers; examples\ninclude when Escape Isla Nublar is running and when CHAOS is being spelled.\nYou must at least hit the first rollover switch on the orbit in order to\nreceive credit for the Advance X shot, however.\nHammond's Bunker  This is a rectangular scoop just below the Turbo Bumpers,\nto the left of the Visitor's Center shot, directly above the top of the\nleft slingshot.  When flashing, it awards Park Revenue.  When lit, it\nawards Mr. DNA.  Otherwise, it awards practically nothing.  Hammond's\nBunker is also the C in CHAOS.\nInlanes  Either Inlane lights (flashing) the Control Room for about five\nseconds (note that during that time, the Turbo Bumpers may still change the\ncurrently flashing Computer Screen).  If you have already had one System\nFailure, the Inlanes will no longer light the Control Room.  Note that both\nRamp returns feed above the Inlane sensors, although the right return may\ncause the ball to jump over the sensor or to miss the Inlane entirely.\nLeft Inlane  This lights the Boat Dock for several seconds, during which\ntime hitting the Boat Dock will spot a Species Target, if any remain unlit.\nRight Inlane  This lights Advance X on the Visitor's Center shot, which I\nhave never purposely shot for.  The Bonus Multiplier starts at 1X, and\nproceeds 3X, 6X, and 9X.  It also lights Hammond's Bunker for the Park\nRevenue value.\nOutlanes  There is no rubber on the lane dividers.  However, the playfield\nis arranged to actually protect the ball from Outlane drains.  With small\nnudges as the ball wanders towards the Outlanes, you should experience\ninfrequent Outlane drains.  If you still have the Smart Missile, Outlane\ndrains (except during Tri-Ball, Two-Ball, or CHAOS) will disable it.  A\nsuccessful Death Save or Bang Back will then re-enable it.  There are\nSpecial lights on the Outlanes; when Special is lit, both Outlanes will\nremain lit until collected (although repeated collections are possible\ndue to a bug with Tri-Ball).\nLeft Outlane  There is no kickback.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!\nComputer Screens  These are twelve lights in the area directly above the\nflippers.  They represent Control Room awards, and indicate progress\ntowards System Failure.  Computer Screens are also referred to as CRTs.\nPlayfield Lights  The playfield is littered with Species Lights on the\nIsland Map, representing your progress towards lighting Tri-Ball.  You can\nsafely ignore these lights.  There are also several lights for each of the\nthree places to visit: Visitor's Center, Helicopter Pad, and Boat Dock.\nThere is also a light for the Mosquito, which is placed unusually far from\nthe actual Mosquito-in-amber piece in the far back center of the playfield.\nSlingshots  There are the usual two above the flippers.  They are not\nincredibly sensitive, so even a weak kickout from Hammond's Bunker may\ngraze the Left Slingshot, but should come to the left flipper nonetheless.\nBalls  Six of 'em, a regular party.\n\n\nOpening Animation\nYou can skip the lengthy opening animation by flipping the right flipper or\npulling the trigger (be careful not to prematurely launch the first ball into\nplay, however).  You will probably find yourself doing this after the first\ncouple of games.\n\nSkill Shot\nThe Skill Shot is a Video Mode.  A dinosaur is walking back and forth in\nyour sights.  Pull the trigger to shoot the dinosaur.  The trick is that\nthe dinosaur sometimes (on all balls except the first) stop to look at you\njust before it enters your sights.  Don't lead the shot too much, and you'll\nbe OK.  Because the shot is registered as soon as you fire, rather than when\nthe ball hits something, this works pretty well.  There are also small\nindicators in the lower corners of the screen, which say \"FIRE!\" when the\ndinosaur is in your sights.\n\nHitting the dinosaur is worth 2M on Ball 1, 3M on Ball 2, and 4M on Ball 3.\nMissing the dinosaur is worth 1/10 as much.\n\nA successful Skill Shot enables Super Pops and gives the quote \"Thumper\nReady!\".  Since the ball immediately goes into the Turbo Bumpers, this is\nworthwhile.  Super Pops makes each Turbo Bumper worth 100K, and each\ncompletion of all three Turbo Bumpers worth 1M.  After the Skill Shot, Super\nPops only seems to last for a short while, but normal Super Pops only end\nwhen any switch outside the Turbo Bumpers is closed (except the first\nVisitor's Center rollover switch).\n\nIf you press the Smart Missile button for the Skill Shot, the ball is\nlaunched into play, but the Smart Missile is not used; the button simply\nacts as the trigger would.  Also, normally, pressing the left flipper a\ncertain number of times will launch the ball as if the trigger had been\npulled.\n\nThe Data East rules say that you are shooting to \"stun\" the dinosaur, but\nit certainly looks like you hit him with a missile, and he kind of splats...\n(Apparently this is a scene from the book, as are a number of other\nanimations which don't exactly correspond to the movie.)\n\nComputer Screens\nThere are eleven Computer Screens, which are collected from the Control Room\nwhen it is lit or flashing.  The Control Room is lit at the beginning of each\nball.  It is indefinitely relit by shooting the Power Shed.  It is lit for\napproximately five seconds by either Inlane.  After you have completed System\nFailure, the Inlanes will no longer light the Control Room, making it more\ndifficult to get a second System Failure.\n\nThe Computer Screens are:\n\n\n Stampede\n Escape Isla Nubar\n Raptor Two-Ball\n Electric Fence\n Spitter Attack\n System Boot\n Raptors' Rampage\n Mosquito Millions\n Feed T-Rex\n Bone Busting\n Light Extra Ball\n (System Failure)\n\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Stampede is always the currently lit Computer\nScreen.  The Turbo Bumpers rotate the currently flashing Computer Screen\nwhen the Control Room is not lit (or is only flashing because of an Inlane).\nWhen the Control Room is lit, however, the currently flashing Computer\nScreen is \"locked in\".  Therefore, the first Computer Screen awarded is\nalways Stampede.\n\nYou can have any number of Computer Screen awards running at one time; you\ncan relight the Control Room and collect new awards concurrently with awards\nthat are already running.  The animation and sound associated with the most\nrecently awarded Computer Screen will take precedence over the others.\n\nThe only Screen which is immediately obvious is Light Extra Ball.  All other\nScreens have their own sections in the Rules.  Note that at the end of any\nball, the game may decide to change the current Computer Screen to Light\nExtra Ball, out of kindness (well, actually, it's a percentaging thing).\n\nWhen all Screens have been collected, the Control Room and Power Shed are\nautomatically flashing for System Failure.\n\nStarting System Failure effectively aborts any Computer Screen rounds which\nwere already running, except that you may still collect a lit Extra Ball.\nThese rounds do not restart after System Failure ends, although Two-Ball\nwill remain lit if it was lit and uncollected before.\n\nHitting the Smart Missile in single ball play, with no Tri-Ball or Two-Ball\nlit on the playfield, will award the next Computer Screen, even if the\nControl Room is not lit.\n\nHitting the unlit Control Room gives an annoying quote from Nedry: \"You\ndidn't say the magic word!\"\n\nIf the Control Room sensor is malfunctioning (not an uncommon problem, and\none that your operator absolutely must be convinced to fix by resoldering\ndetached wires, resoldering or replacing the diode, or respacing the arm of\nthe switch), shots to the Control Room will be registered as shots to\nHammond's Bunker, you will not be able to collect Computer Screens except\nby Mr. DNA awards, and you will not be able to complete CHAOS except by\nusing the Smart Missile.\n\nStampede\nThis Computer Screen starts an escalating Frenzy mode, which lasts for 20\nseconds.  Every switch scores 300K and increases that value by 10K.  The\npoints are awarded immediately.  Also, all game features proceed as normal.\n\nThere is a 5M award for shooting T-Rex or Galimimus during this round.  There\nis a particularly cool animation for hitting Galimimus.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile, on most ROMs at least, is a severe disappointment,\nawarding a Stampede total of roughly 10M and ending Stampede!\n\nEscape Isla Nubar\nThis Computer Screen lights the Visitor's Center, the Helicopter Pad, and\nthe Boat Dock for 21M, which counts down by millions.  Hitting any of the\nthree targets will award the current Escape value, add 10M to it, and start\ncounting down again for the remaining targets.  The round ends when a total\nof 10M has been counted down.  (This is not very clearly described in the\nData East rules, to say the least.)  To further confuse the issue, their\nrules indicate that the maximum total points available in this round are 66M.\nI find it rather amusing that the value actually starts at 21M rather than\nthe 20M indicated by the Data East rules, presumably so that the countdown\ntimer can be started immediately.\n\nThe best non-Smart Missile strategy for this mode is to hit the ball up to\nthe Boat Dock right away, then shoot for the Helicopter Pad with the upper\nright flipper, then shoot the ball into the Turbo Bumpers through the gate.\nThis works well because credit is given for the Visitor's Center shot in\nthis round for merely hitting the Turbo Bumpers.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile at the very beginning of this round will sometimes\naward the true maximum values of 21M, 31M, and then 41M, for a total of 93M.\nHowever, the total will sometimes be only 90M or 87M.  Needless to say, if\nthere is a problem with CHAOS on your machine, this round is the most\nvaluable time to use the Smart Missile.\n\nNote that on at least some ROMs, passing the Replay value by shooting Escape\nvalues will not award the Replay.  However, the Smart Missile will never (in\nthis case, at least) fail to award the Replay.\n\nRaptor Two-Ball\nThis Computer Screen lights the Boat Dock for Two-Ball, which is Data East's\nequivalent of a Quick Multiball(TM).  Two-Ball will remain lit until\ncollected, across balls.  When the Boat Dock is hit (and you are not already\nin Tri-Ball or CHAOS or Super Egg Mania), a second ball will be launched into\nplay.  Any ball which drains in roughly the first ten seconds of Two-Ball\nwill be relaunched into play.  (This allows for a few quick, safe Jackpots.)\n\nDuring Raptor Two-Ball, the Raptor Pit is lit for the Raptor Jackpot.  The\nData East rules indicate that these start at 3M and increase by 1M each time\none is collected, but this has apparently been changed.  Raptor Jackpots\nstart at a base of 7M and increase by 2M for each Jackpot collected, but the\nvalue is also increased in some other fashion, details unknown.\n\nThere is no Danger feature (ball saver) active during Raptor Two-Ball, so be\ncareful.  Two-Ball ends, of course, when one or both balls drain.\n\nStarting Two-Ball unconditionally aborts many of the Computer Screen modes,\nwhich is a real disappointment.  Also, you cannot start Tri-Ball while in\nTwo-Ball.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile when Two-Ball is lit will start Two-Ball, unless\nTri-Ball is also lit, in which case it takes precedence.  Using the Smart\nMissile during Two-Ball will probably only collect a Raptor Jackpot, which is\na genuine waste.\n\nCheck out the opening animation for Raptor Two-Ball.\n\nElectric Fence\n\"Electric Fence Mode.\"\n\nThis Computer Screen starts a timed round during which cute little Timmy is\nfoolishly climbing around on an Electric Fence, which is slowly charging.\nThe display shows Timmy climbing, the number of hits needed to save him\n(apparently we have to shake the little idiot off the fence or something\nlike that), and the power meter of the Fence.\n\nGet Timmy off the Fence by getting 15 hits in the Turbo Bumpers and/or the\nSlingshots.  You have 20 seconds in which to do this.  If you succeed, you\nare awarded 30M.  If you fail, Timmy is electrocuted, and we actually get to\nwatch, unlike Nell's death in Rocky & Bullwinkle.  Yea!\n\nUsing the Smart Missile in this round will save Timmy and award the 30M.\n\nLet him fry, I say.  It's more fun than 30M.  On the other hand, this round\nis easier in newer ROMs; older ROMs required more hits, I believe.\n\n\"We're going to need another Timmy!\" (not a quote from the game)\n\nSpitter Attack\nThis Computer Screen starts a timed round during which the loathsome Nedry is\nbeing attacked by a Spitter dinosaur.  The Spitter Targets are the vertical\nbank just below Hammond's Bunker, facing right.  Hitting any of them counts\nas a \"spit\", and the Spitter will spit at Nedry.  The first hit is 5M, the\nsecond 10M, and the third 15M, for a maximum total of 30M.  The points are\nnot displayed (awarded?) until the round ends or the ball drains.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile in this round awards 30M and ends the round.\n\nAs the attract mode instructions say, \"Shoot giant saliva wads at Nedry...\"\n\nSystem Boot\nThis Computer Screen starts a timed round during which the three scoops\n(Hammond's Bunker, Control Room, and Power Shed) are lit (green light).  When\na scoop is hit, it is no longer lit (for the purposes of this round).  The\nfirst scoop is worth 5M, the second 10M, and the third 15M, for a maximum\ntotal of 30M.\n\nEach scoop displays a fake computer bootstrap sequence, consisting of a DOS\nprompt and command:\n\nC:\\PARK> SYS. BOOT\n\nHitting the Power Shed to relight the Control Room normally gives a similar\ndisplay.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile in this round awards each of the three scoops, for a\ntotal of 30M, ending the round.\n\nRaptors' Rampage\nThis Computer Screen starts a timed round during which the Raptor Pit is lit\nfor a varying amount.  The display shows a Raptor moving back and forth in\nthe kitchen, with the current value of the Raptor Pit beneath.  The values\nare 5M, 6M, 7M, 8M, 9M, 10M, 9M, 8M, 7M, 6M, 5M.  Hitting the Raptor Pit adds\na small amount of time to the timer, so that the Rampage could potentially\nnever end.  Watch closely; when you collect a Rampage value, the Raptor on\nscreen pauses and reaches over and \"grabs\" a value.\n\nI am not sure what using the Smart Missile does in this round.  It probably\nonly awards the currently lit value, which is complicated by the fact that\nthe Smart Missile does not immediately collect everything on the board.  In\nany case, the Smart Missile does not end this round if used.\n\nMosquito Millions\n\"Mos-QUI-to!\"\n\nThis Computer Screen starts a timed round during which the Egg is worth 5M,\nwith its value increasing by 1M each time it is hit (to no known limit as far\nas I have determined).  This round lasts for 20 seconds.\n\nAs in many other modes, it appears that hits on the Egg in this mode do not\ncount towards cracking Eggs in the usual fashion.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile in this round will only award one value from the Egg,\nwithout ending the round.\n\nFeed T-Rex\nThis Computer Screen starts a timed round during which T-Rex is waiting to be\nfed a live goat.  The display shows T-Rex quietly waiting in front of the\ngoat, as the ominous background music slowly increases in tempo.  That music\nis a fantastic bass rumble.  This round lasts for 30 seconds, and feeding\nT-Rex (yes, he actually eats on-screen) is worth 30M (the Data East rules say\n25M, but this was apparently changed).\n\nUsing the Smart Missile in this round feeds T-Rex for 30M, ending the round.\nI sometimes prefer to just hold the ball and listen to the bass.\n\nIf the Graphic Realism option has been disabled by your operator, T-Rex will\nnot actually eat the goat on the display.  Bummer.\n\nBone Busting\nThis Computer Screen starts a timed round during which a raptor is trying to\ndestroy a T-Rex skeleton.  Three Ramp shots are needed to do this, which\nscores a disappointing 20M.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile in this round immediately destroys the skeleton for\n20M, ending the round.\n\nThe Ramp is a difficult shot on most machines, particularly to loop; this\nround should almost certainly be worth at least 30M, or 10M per shot.\n\nSystem Failure\nWhen all Computer Screens have been collected, the Control Room and the Power\nShed are immediately lit for System Failure.\n\nSystem Failure is a Six-Ball mode which lasts for 45 seconds.  Balls which\ndrain are autolaunched back into play as soon as the mechanism can do so.\nDuring System Failure, all switches score 1M, and no other features are\nactive (except that you can still collect a lit Extra Ball, and perhaps even\nlit Specials).  The total points awarded are tracked on-screen.  When System\nFailure ends, the flippers, Slingshots, and Turbo Bumpers shut off until all\nsix balls have returned to the trough.  After a very brief pause, a ball is\nautolaunched and play resumes normally, with all Computer Screens again\navailable.\n\nUsing the Smart Missile during System Failure is worth exactly 50M.  Starting\nSystem Failure using the Smart Missile will also credit this 50M to your\nSystem Failure total.  The System Failure total is not credited to your\nscore until System Failure ends and all balls have returned to the trough.\nPresumably, you can Tilt during System Failure, but there is no excuse for\ndoing so.\n\nAfter System Failure, the Inlanes will no longer light the Control Room for\nthe next Computer Screen; only the Power Shed will do so.  This makes it\nrather difficult to reach a second System Failure.  However, immediately\nafter System Failure, the Control Room is lit for Stampede.\n\nSystem Failure was developed independently of the Lost In The Zone feature of\nBally's Twilight Zone.\n\nVictory Lap\nAs in many Data East games, Jurassic Park lights an additional feature\nwhenever a replay value is reached.  Unlike previous Data East releases,\nhowever, which typically lit a ramp or orbit for a single 25M award, there\nis more complexity to the Victory Lap in Jurassic Park.\n\nWhen a replay is awarded, the ramp is lit for the Victory Lap for 30 seconds.\nThe first five ramp shots are worth 5M, and the sixth is 25M.  The maximum\ntotal that can be scored from the Victory Lap is 50M.  This is made trickier\nby the fact that two consecutive ramp shots awards Bonus Held and returns\nthe ball to the Right Inlane, interrupting the looping shot.\n\nThe Victory Lap is the only thing which seems to run to completion regardless\nof other rounds and modes.  You can even have the Victory Lap running during\nSystem Failure.\n\nYou cannot use the Smart Missile to complete the entire Victory Lap for\n50M; this has been verified.\n\nJurassic Park is the last Data East game to feature the Victory Lap, which\nhas been present since Checkpoint.\n\nShoot Out\nAt various random intervals during the game while the ball is in play, a\nVideo Mode will begin, during which a dinosaur walks across the screen, in\nfront of a machine gun.  Fire the gun rapidly (four or five shots will\nsuffice) to \"stun\" the dinosaur for 3M.  There is enough of a grace period on\nthis feature that it should be almost impossible to miss.  If the Video Mode\ndisplay has already ended, you can still grab the trigger and fire, and the\nVideo Mode will restart!  You can recognize that the Video Mode is beginning\nby the distinctive and familiar sound from Lethal Weapon 3.\n\nAccording to early Data East rules, completing this Video Mode also spots a\nSpecies Target.  However, doing this now instead requires a lit Boat Dock\nshot.  Completing this Video Mode instead enables Super Pops.  Super Pops\nenabled in this fashion are very kind.  When Turbo Bumpers are hit, they are\nworth 100K each, 1M for each set of three as for a successful Skill Shot, but\nthis is not timed.  Super Pops only ends when any switch other than the Turbo\nBumpers or the first Visitor's Center rollover switch is tripped.\n\nYou cannot use the Smart Missile to complete this Video Mode, which is\nprobably just as well.\n\nRaptor Pit\nShooting the Raptor Pit at any time during the game will award the current\nRaptor value, which starts at 2M at the beginning of every ball (unless it\nis held by two consecutive Helicopter Pad shots), and increases in an unusual\nfashion.  Hitting the Raptor Pit at any time increases the Raptor value by\n350K and lights Danger briefly (which also represents the ball saver).  If\nthe Danger light is flashing, hitting the Raptor Pit awards twice the current\nRaptor value and increases it normally.\n\nA random Mr. DNA award can also boost the Raptor Pit value by 5M.\n\nOn the machines I've played, the Raptor Pit starts at 2M, not 3M as indicated\nby the Data East rules, and the value boost is definitely 350K, not 250K.\n\nT-Rex Bounty\nThere are four red lights above the rules card in the lower left corner of\nthe machine, representing progress towards spelling T-REX.  When T-REX is\nspelled (by repeatedly hitting T-Rex), the T-Rex Bounty, also known as the\nPaddock Jackpot, is awarded.  The Data East rules indicate that the Bounty\nbegins at 5M and increases by 100K for each ramp shot, but it appears to\nstart at 8M and may be increased by other features as well.\n\nNormally, the Bounty value is carried over between balls, players, and games.\nThe value can go as high as 99.9M!\n\nCaptive Ball\nIn normal play, shooting the Captive Ball contributes to cracking open a\ndinosaur Egg and hatching a baby dinosaur.  In older ROMs, the hits and\nawards are:\n\n\nEgg #HitsAward\n  1           3          5M                   \n  2           4         10M or Extra Ball     \n  3           5         15M                   \n  4           6         Extra Ball            \n  5           6         20M                   \n  6           6         Mystery               \n\n\nThe Mystery award can be a random point value, Extra Ball lit (at Boat Dock),\nor Special lit (at both Outlanes).  Every cracked Egg after the sixth will\nscore Super Egg Mania (also known as Power Egg Mania or just Super Egg).\n\nCracking an Egg is accompanied by a cute animation and a snippet of lullaby,\nwhich always cracked me up (pun intended).\n\nYou can also crack Eggs with a Mr. DNA award.\n\nOn newer ROMs, cracking the second Egg sometimes awards Extra Ball.  This\nis determined entirely according to reflexive Extra Ball percentage done by\nthe software.  If too many Extra Balls are generally being collected, no\nExtra Ball will be offered from the Egg.\n\nIn newer ROMs, cracking the fourth and every subsequent Egg starts Super Egg\nMania, which almost makes it a reasonable goal.\n\nSuper Egg Mania\nThe only reasonable way I've found to reach Super Egg Mania is to receive\nit as a random award from Mr. DNA.  During Super Egg Mania, most game\nfeatures are disabled, and you have 25 seconds to shoot the Egg for 5M.\nHitting the Egg launches an additional ball into play while this timer is\nrunning.  When the timer is complete, Super Egg Mania continues for as long\nas you have more than one ball in play (and almost every other game feature\nremains disabled).  During the remainder of Super Egg Mania, all Egg hits are\nstill only 5M, and no additional balls are launched into play.\n\nThe only real reason for starting Super Egg Mania is to hear the hilarious\nmusic and see the animation for hitting the Egg.\n\nNote that, in older ROMs, reaching Super Egg Mania by hitting the Egg itself\nrequires something like 36 hits!\n\nUsing the Smart Missile during Super Egg Mania will likely award 5M for an\nEgg hit, also launching a ball into play during the 25 second timer.\n\nIf you drain all of the balls in play before the 25 second timer expires,\nthe timer will continue to run while there are no balls in play - there is,\nof course, nothing you can do at this point except perhaps hit the Smart\nMissile - when the timer expires, Bonus Countdown will proceed as normal.\n\nPark Revenue\nThis is a small award in the tradition of Sarlacc Pit from Star Wars.  It\nstarts at exactly 500K at the beginning of each ball, and is increased 30K\nfor every Turbo Bumper hit.  There is apparently no way to hold this value\nover to the next ball.  The Park Revenue value is awarded by hitting\nHammond's Bunker when lit by the Right Inlane (flashing blue light).  You can\nsafely ignore this feature entirely, at least until you have completed one\nSystem Failure and need a shot from the Right Inlane feeds (although Advance\nX is, sad to say, often more lucrative).\n\nMr. DNA\nMr. DNA is lit at Hammond's Bunker by the appropriate number of Ramp shots.\nData East rules indicate that the first three Mr. DNA's require seven Ramp\nshots, the next three require eight, and all subsequent require nine.  On all\nmachines I have played, however, far fewer Ramp shots have actually been\nrequired.  It seemed that only three are required for the first Mr. DNA, five\nfor the next, etc.\n\nTwo consecutive Ramp shots are actually worth three Ramp shots for the\npurpose of lighting Mr. DNA; the second shot counts twice (and returns the\nball to the Right Inlane rather than the Left).  Nice touch.\n\nYou can make progress towards lighting the next Mr. DNA while Mr. DNA is\nalready lit (and ramp shots at any time appear to count), and you can\nindeed stack lit Mr. DNAs (that is, have Mr. DNA lit twice, so that it\nremains lit after collecting it once).\n\nCollecting a certain large number of DNA Strands (lighting Mr. DNA ten times,\nperhaps?) lights an Extra Ball at the Boat Dock.  This can be achieved\nrepeatedly.  Also, after you light Mr. DNA for the 99th time, the next is #0.\n\nMr. DNA offers you a choice between three selections, which are randomly\nselected from the following list:\n\n\n 5M, 10M, 15M, 20M\n Super Pops\n Million Pops (?)\n Complete Egg\n Light Special\n Runaway Extra Ball (at the Boat Dock)\n Runaway Score (Hurry Up, 20M down to 5M)\n Runaway Two-Ball (Hurry Up, 10M down to 5M)\n Light Tri-Ball\n Spitters Double Round (??)\n Advance Park Revenue 5M\n Advance Raptors 5M\n Raptor Pit Value Held\n Award Lit CRT\n Super Egg\n Bonus Held\n\n\nAs Mr. DNA points to each selection offered, flip or pull the trigger to\nselect it.  Doing this during the introductory animation may automatically\naward the first selection in the list.  Be careful; the first selection is\nonly focused briefly.  It's best to wait until Mr. DNA makes a second pass\nthrough the list.\n\nRunaway awards are lit at the Boat Dock for 20 seconds, counting down\nimmediately.  Runaway Two-Ball appears to include a score with it, but I have\nnot seen it.  I have also never seen Million Pops and I suspect that it has\nbeen removed from release ROMs.\n\nI do not know what the Spitters Double Round is, but I hope and pray that it\nis not a Double Score mode.  I also get the feeling that this award is no\nlonger present in release ROMs.\n\nIn Tournament Mode, the same set of awards are always offered for the first\nMr. DNA (5M, Complete Egg, Runaway Score), the second Mr. DNA, the third Mr.\nDNA, etc.  That is to say, each subsequent Mr. DNA offers a different set,\nbut for example, the second Mr. DNA always offers the same three items.  I do\nknow that the third Mr. DNA in Tournament Mode offers Light Special and Light\nTri-Ball.\n\nCheck out the animations for Mr. DNA.\n\nBoat Dock\nDuring normal play, the Left Inlane briefly lights the Boat Dock.  Hitting\nthe lit Boat Dock will spot a species target to make progress towards\nlighting Tri-Ball.  This spotting function was originally performed by the\nin-play Video Mode, but this has been changed.\n\nTri-Ball\nTri-Ball is a significant goal in Jurassic Park, and a significant source of\npoints.  Tri-Ball is normally lit by hitting all of the Species Targets on\nthe playfield (these can also be spotted by the lit Boat Dock).  It can also\nbe lit by a Mr. DNA award, or by using the Smart Missile in normal play,\nwhich will effectively hit all of the Species Targets for you.  If you have\nnot lit or started Tri-Ball by the beginning of your third ball (disregarding\nExtra Balls), it will automatically be lit for you.  For the first Tri-Ball,\nhitting any one of a set of species targets will spot that entire bank, most\nnotable in the case of the Spitter targets (lower left corner).\n\nWhen Tri-Ball is lit, start it by feeding T-Rex once or hitting the Raptor\nPit several times (to \"taunt\" them).  The first Tri-Ball will require 3\nRaptor Pit shots to begin, the second will require 5, the third will require\n7, and all subsequent Tri-Balls can only be started by feeding T-Rex (which\nis generally the easier option, anyhow).  If Tri-Ball is lit because you are\non your third ball and did not light or start Tri-Ball already, only one\nRaptor Pit shot will be required to start Tri-Ball.  I have heard that Raptor\nPit shots on the same ball you light Tri-Ball are credited towards the number\nof shots needed to actually start Tri-Ball, although at least one shot will\nalways be required.\n\nWhenever Tri-Ball is lit and normal play is underway, using the Smart Missile\nwill start Tri-Ball.\n\nStarting Tri-Ball prematurely ends almost any mode which is running, except\nthe Victory Lap.  You also cannot start Tri-Ball (or much of anything else)\nduring Super Egg Mania or Two-Ball.\n\nWhen Tri-Ball is started, a total of three balls will be put into play.  For\nthe first few seconds of Tri-Ball, draining one or two balls will cause one\nto be relaunched into play (draining all three never seems to give back more\nthan two - not that I would ever do this ;).  As soon as Tri-Ball is started,\neven while there is only one ball still in play, there are two Jackpots lit.\nThe Ramp is lit for the regular Jackpot value, while the Helicopter Pad is\nlit for a Double Jackpot.  The base Jackpot value is 15M, and during Tri-\nBall, all switches add their score to both Jackpot values instead of to your\nscore.  This means that the Double Jackpot is not actually exactly twice the\nbase Jackpot value.\n\nCollecting either Jackpot immediately begins the first CHAOS mode.  Contrary\nto the Data East rules, you do not have to collect both the regular and the\nDouble Jackpot in order to enter CHAOS (the rules were likely changed in\norder to better accommodate switch failures and to improve gameplay).\n\nUsing the Smart Missile will collect only the Double Jackpot.  What I wrote\nin previous versions of this Guide about collecting both Jackpots was\nextremely outdated information that I failed to correct for a long time.\n\nIf you drain all but one ball while the Jackpots are still lit, Tri-Ball\nRestart will be lit for 15 seconds, starting immediately.  You can then\nrestart Tri-Ball by hitting the Raptor Pit once or feeding T-Rex.  It is\npossible that no Tri-Ball Restart is offered for later Tri-Balls; I am not\nentirely sure.\n\nThe Tri-Ball Restart only launches two balls into play (in fact, I believe\nit's called a Two-Ball Restart, but it has nothing to do with Raptor Two-\nBall) and there is no ball saver or relaunch.  In particular, hitting the\nRaptor Pit for this Restart and losing that ball will leave you with only\none ball on the table, in normal play.  Worse yet, if the machine fails to\nautolaunch the second ball onto the table, you will find yourself playing\nthe Fun-With-Bonus(TM) round!\n\nUsing the Smart Missile while Tri-Ball Restart is lit will restart Tri-Ball,\nbut it's better to try for the Restart manually, and if you miss, the Smart\nMissile can be used to relight Tri-Ball indefinitely.\n\nCHAOS\nIn the first CHAOS mode, the five CHAOS letters are lit and may be collected\nimmediately.  Each CHAOS letter is worth 5M, and according to the Data East\nrules, completing CHAOS is worth an additional 10M.  You must complete CHAOS\nwhile at least two balls are still in play (or at least not yet registered in\nthe trough).  Using the Smart Missile at this point will complete the first\nCHAOS for 25M (or 35M?), leading to Six-Ball play.\n\nWhen CHAOS is completed, Six-Ball play begins.  On older ROMs, while the six\nballs are being launched into play, CHAOS letters are not awarded.  However,\non newer ROMs, the second set of CHAOS letters can be awarded almost\nimmediately, which makes it impossible to miss the H letter (it is credited\nfor any Turbo Bumper hit).  There is a relaunch period at the beginning of\nthis mode, just as in the beginning of Tri-Ball.  During Six-Ball play, you\nmust spell CHAOS again, for 10M per letter, while keeping as many balls in\nplay as possible (at least two, of course).  Using the Smart Missile at this\npoint will complete the second CHAOS for at least 50M, which lights the Feed\nT-Rex 50M.\n\nWhen the second CHAOS is completed, you must Feed T-Rex, while keeping at\nleast two balls in play.  Feeding T-Rex at this point awards 50M, and lights\nboth the Ramp and the Helicopter Pad for twin Super Jackpots.  Using the\nSmart Missile at this point will Feed T-Rex for 50M.\n\nThe Super Jackpot base value is 600M minus 100M for each ball drained and not\nrelaunched into play.  The Ramp is worth this base Super Jackpot value, while\nthe Helicopter Pad is worth an additional normal Jackpot value of 15M.  These\nvalues both increase as in regular Tri-Ball (accumulating normal scoring\nswitch values).  The maximum value of the Super Jackpot is therefore\n615M-plus-change for the Helicopter Pad.  Collecting one Super Jackpot leaves\nthe other lit.  Using the Smart Missile at this point will collect both\nSuper Jackpots.\n\nCollecting both Super Jackpots returns to the second CHAOS mode, without\nlaunching any new balls into play.  As long as at least two balls remain in\nplay, the sequence of second CHAOS, Feed T-Rex for 50M, and twin Super\nJackpots will repeat indefinitely.  This does not mean, however, that this is\nlikely to happen.  ;)\n\nIf there are balls missing in the machine, this is not counted against the\nSuper Jackpot value.  If there are only three balls in the machine, for\nexample, the Super Jackpot will still start at 600M, decrease to 500M for one\ndrain, and then end for the next drain.  Therefore, the base Super Jackpot\nvalue is not, strictly speaking, 100M for each ball in play.\n\nCombo Shots\nThere are at least two Combo Shots in Jurassic Park.  I believe that these\nCombo Shots are only available during normal play (not Tri-Ball, etc).  The\nCombo of Ramp to Boat Dock to Helicopter Pad is worth 5M.  Following this up\nby a shot to T-Rex is an additional 10M.  These are not particularly\nsignificant and quite rare, besides.\n\nSmart Missile\nThe Smart Missile is a fantastic idea, and the rules of Jurassic Park are\nreally designed with the Smart Missile in mind.  You are allowed one, only\none, not zero, not two, Smart Missile per game.  There is absolutely no way\nto get another Smart Missile in the course of a game.  Use it wisely.\n\nThe Smart Missile collects everything that is lit on the playfield when it\nis used.  This ranges from the very simple (Species Targets, Computer\nScreens) to the respectable (Jackpots, Feed T-Rex, Escape Isla Nubar) to the\ntruly awe-inspiring (twin Super Jackpots, minimum award 445M, maximum\n1245M-plus-change).  At the very least, the Smart Missile should guarantee\nthat you get to play Tri-Ball (Tri-Ball will be lit at the beginning of the\nthird ball if you have not yet started it, and the Smart Missile can be used\nto start it).\n\nUsing the Smart Missile will collect any lit Extra Balls.  If Tri-Ball is not\nlit, the next Computer Screen will be collected, even if the Control Room is\nunlit.\n\nThere are a few things which the Smart Missile will not collect.  Among\nthese are Runaway awards (lit by Mr. DNA), any Mr. DNA awards (even if you\nare at the Mr. DNA menu when you press Smart Missile), Park Revenue (even if\nlit by the Right Inlane), T-Rex Bounty or T-REX letters, any of the Hold\nawards (double shot on Helipad or double shot on Ramp), Advance X (even if\nlit), Combo Shots (obviously), and the lit (by Left Inlane) Boat Dock (no big\nloss, since the Smart Missile will instead hit all species targets for you).\n\nOutlane drains deactivate the Smart Missile, but a center drain isn't\nregistered until the ball lands in the trough.  A successful Death Save or\nBang Back will re-enable the Smart Missile as soon as the game notices\n(assuming you still had the Smart Missile).\n\nDeath Saves and Bang Backs\nA successful Death Save or Bang Back, which is defined by Jurassic Park as\nany time in single ball play when an Outlane sensor is tripped, followed by\nsome other sensor before the ball lands in the trough, shows a picture of\nT-Rex and awards 3M (originally 5M, but lowered).  This is actually a very\ncool animation which you have to watch closely to see - a T-Rex skeleton\nmorphs into a living T-Rex :-)\n\nI believe that Slingshot sensors may be excluded from defining Death Saves,\nas these sensors are most likely to become flaky.\n\nYou cannot, of course, use the Smart Missile to receive credit for a Death\nSave.  The Outlane sensors disable the Smart Missile.\n\nEnd-Of-Ball Bonus\nThe End-Of-Ball Bonus is gradually increased by most targets during play.\nI believe it starts at a base of 100K.  It is subject to the Bonus\nMultiplier, which progresses 1X, 3X, 6X, 9X.  The Advance X shot is the\nVisitor's Center, when temporarily lit by the Right Inlane.\n\nThe End-Of-Ball Bonus, and likely the Bonus Multiplier as well, is held over\nbetween balls by two consecutive Ramp shots.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a cap on the End-Of-Ball Bonus base value at 2M, for\na maximum possible of 18M.  This makes the Advance X shot less than tempting,\nespecially since it is very difficult.\n\nYou can flip to accelerate the End-Of-Ball Bonus countdown, but it's\nblissfully short already.\n\nDuring the End-Of-Ball Bonus countdown, the Tilt sensor is deactivated.  This\nis a great time to slide the machine back into position, or whatever.\n\nMiscellaneous Scoring\nA few thousand here, a few thousand there.  Pretty soon it doesn't add up to\nreal points.  So don't worry about it.\n\nCows\nNo, but there's a goat in Feed T-Rex, and plenty of dinosaurs, which are\nawfully cool, regardless.\n\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\nThere are two major goals in Jurassic Park, and it's quite reasonable to\nattempt both in any one game.  One major goal is System Failure, and the\nother is the entire Tri-Ball and CHAOS sequence.\n\nIf you are concentrating on System Failure, there are a few Computer Screens\nwhich are probably best ignored.  Among these are Bone Busting (the Ramp is\nnot really as easy a shot as the game seems to think), Electric Fence\n(especially on older ROMs), and definitely Mosquito Millions.  Payoffs from\nthe other Screens are generally easier or more worthwhile.\n\nFor the first System Failure, it is easier to relight the Control Room with\nthe Inlanes than by shooting for the Power Shed (it's a fairly tricky shot).\nThe Ramp will always return to an Inlane - normally to the left, but two\nconsecutive shots will return the second to the right, unless you are in\nBone Busting mode - and the Control Room can be shot on the move from either\nflipper.  The shot from the right flipper is straight and simple.  The shot\nfrom the left flipper is very early - it is essential to master this shot!\nIn fact, the earlier the better, as long as you aren't hitting the left\nSlingshot frame.  A shot which grazes the left side of the Control Room\nscoop is very likely to fall in, while a shot to the right side will hit the\nTriceratops target and head directly for the center drain.\n\nDuring System Failure, it's to your advantage to keep as many balls actively\nin play (not trapped) as possible, because of the delay in relaunching them.\nThe Turbo Bumpers are obviously the best place for the balls to be during\nSystem Failure, but the Species Targets and Slingshots are also significant.\nI suspect that half of a typical System Failure score comes from the Turbo\nBumpers, and most of the rest from Species and Slingshots.\n\nI recommend saving the Smart Missile for use with the Tri-Ball and CHAOS\nsequences, unless you start several lucrative modes such as Escape Isla\nNublar (93M) or Electric Fence (30M), for which the Smart Missile would be\nworth enough to reach a replay, and for which you aren't likely to finish\nthe mode otherwise.\n\nI prefer to start Tri-Ball by taunting the Raptors, as this leaves a ball in\nplay, with which I have a chance to immediately shoot a Jackpot before other\nballs get in the way.  In Tri-Ball and the ensuing sequences, be very careful\nwhen deciding whether or not to use the Smart Missile.  The best times are\nwhen the first CHAOS is unfinished and too many balls are draining, or when\nthe second CHAOS has started and letters are being awarded, or when the Super\nJackpots are lit.  There are certainly bad times to use the Smart Missile,\nhowever.  If you have not yet collected a Jackpot when all but one ball\ndrain, it is wiser to save the Smart Missile and shoot for the Tri-Ball\nRestart instead.  If the Tri-Ball Restart is about to time out, don't waste\nthe Smart Missile on it; using the Smart Missile immediately afterwards will\nrelight a \"real\" Tri-Ball (with three balls) in the usual fashion, as well as\ncollecting another Computer Screen.\n\nYou can begin spelling the first CHAOS immediately; you should definitely not\nburn the Smart Missile on this until you see at least one of the last two\nballs in play headed for the drain.\n\nThere is no point in working on spelling the second CHAOS until you see that\nCHAOS letters are being awarded (typically, this is obvious when balls that\nhave been launched into the Turbo Bumpers are still bouncing around, and\nsuddenly the H letter is awarded); concentrate instead on trapping balls.\nBalls which drain at the beginning of this mode are usually relaunched (this\nmay be more true on older ROMs), so don't waste too much effort on making\nsaves, and definitely don't Tilt.\n\nIn the second CHAOS, the hardest letter by far is the O on the Ramp.  This is\ntrue because there are so many balls in play, making it very difficult to get\na clean shot at the Ramp.  Also, if you are trapping balls, it's very hard to\nshoot the Ramp with more than one ball on the lower left flipper at the time.\nBecause of this and the fact that the subsequent Super Jackpot value is based\nentirely on the number of balls remaining in play, it is not a bad idea at\nall to use the Smart Missile to complete the second CHAOS, so that you can\nproceed immediately to Feed T-Rex and Super Jackpots of a much higher value.\n\nDuring CHAOS, you can briefly get rid of balls moving down the Right Inlane\nby shooting either the Control Room (letter A) or Hammond's Bunker (letter\nC).  The Turbo Bumpers are a less pleasant alternative; the ball will come\nout unpredictably.\n\nWhen you reach the Feed T-Rex stage of Six-Ball play, you have a difficult\ndecision to make if you still have the Smart Missile.  T-Rex is a very tricky\nshot to reach without losing trapped balls (each ball lost will significantly\nlower the Super Jackpot value), and you may prefer to use the Smart Missile\nto collect it, so that you can shoot for larger Super Jackpots than if you\nhad drained a few balls while shooting for T-Rex.  On the other hand, the\nSmart Missile can be used immediately after Feed T-Rex for an enormous\npayoff.\n\nI have never shot to purposely light Tri-Ball, although it's a fairly\nreasonable idea.  You should be able to collect a Jackpot in every Tri-Ball\n(particularly with the Tri-Ball Restart feature), and usually make good\nprogress on the first CHAOS (at 10M per letter), even without the Smart\nMissile.  And on newer ROMs, subsequent Tri-Balls will have the CHAOS letters\nin whatever state they were when the last CHAOS mode ended.  The down side is\nthat if a CHAOS letter sensor is malfunctioning, you won't be able to collect\nany CHAOS letters (at 10M each) more than once in an entire game, even in\nsubsequent Tri-Balls.\n\nThe problem with purposely attempting to light Tri-Ball is that not only do\nsome Species Targets not register, there are a few next to the Turbo Bumpers\ngate that cannot reasonably be hit from any flipper hard enough to make them\nregister.  Luckily, the lit Boat Dock will spot Species Targets.\n\nAny ball which is shot to the Boat Dock is fed to the upper right flipper.\nUnless the Helicopter Pad is lit for something useful (only Escape Isla\nNubar and Double Jackpot come to mind), I recommend shooting for T-Rex.  This\nis always worth something, and when T-Rex actually eats the ball, it is fed\nto the Right Inlane for an easy shot at the Control Room or Hammond's Bunker.\n\nOn some machines, after a Helicopter Pad or Visitor's Center shot, you can\nsimply hold up the upper right flipper and the ball will bounce neatly into\nthe T-Rex Paddock.  This depends on the table lean and speed.\n\nA ball which is ejected from the T-Rex Paddock will typically hit either post\nat the end of the plunger lane, and drop towards the left flipper.  This may\nbe different on your machine, so get used to how it behaves.  If it is\nhitting this post, a small nudge can safely put the ball on either flipper,\nwhichever you prefer.  The worst possibility is that the ball will bounce\ninto the Left Outlane.\n\nI have only shot purposely for Hammond's Bunker when Mr. DNA is lit, or for\nthe C letter in CHAOS.  Park Revenue just never interested me.  If you have\nthe ball on the lower right flipper and neither scoop is lit, I recommend a\nsimple flipper pass off the inside corner of the right Slingshot.  From the\nleft flipper, you can shoot the Raptor Pit (easier from a trapped ball),\nthe Ramp, the Power Shed, or the Boat Dock.  Note that you can also usually\nshoot the Raptor Pit from the right flipper (or bounce from the Egg into\nthe T-Rex Paddock).\n\nI have rarely purposely shot for the Raptor Pit, except when it will start\nTri-Ball.  Even with the Danger ball saver, it's possible for a ball to drain\nand roll up the side of the machine such that by the time it reaches the\ntrough, the ball saver is no longer active.  Also, the Raptor Pit is\nextremely dangerous during Tri-Ball play.  On the other hand, it's the only\nuseful target during Raptor Two-Ball.  In any case, it is worth learning how\nto make shots at this target from either flipper.  Also, on Hard settings,\nthe Danger ball saver seems to be much briefer, although I am not certain of\nthis.\n\nThere are a variety of trick shots at the T-Rex Paddock from the lower\nplayfield.  Try aiming for the posts dividing all of the features which face\nthe lower flippers, particularly the left post of the Raptor Pit.  If you\nhave time, however, it is better to pass the ball to the lower left flipper\n(if it is not already there), shoot the Boat Dock, and line up an easy shot\nat T-Rex after the eject.  If you flip too early at the T-Rex Paddock from\nthe upper right flipper, you will sometimes graze the Captive Ball and land\nin the Paddock anyhow, scoring one Egg hit in the process.\n\nI've found that Electric Fence mode really isn't worth the trouble, on older\nROMs at least.  The Turbo Bumpers are not generally powerful enough to\ngenerate 20 hits just for getting the ball in their area, so there's a lot of\nwork and risk in shooting to get the 30M in this mode.  The best strategy for\ngetting safely into the Turbo Bumpers may be to shoot the Raptor Pit and\nintentionally drain, letting the Danger ball saver fire the ball into the\nTurbo Bumpers for you.\n\nThe Spitter Attack mode is really the easiest 30M in the game, because the\ntargets are easy to hit from the lower right flipper.  However, the ball will\nricochet towards the Right Outlane, which may make you nervous ;)\n\nI have always ignored Mosquito Millions and Bone Busting, and usually done\nnothing with Raptors' Rampage (love that opening animation, though).\n\nSystem Boot is a useful Computer Screen, because collecting points from it\ncan be done while lighting and collecting the next Computer Screen.\n\nLearn how the Hammond's Bunker kickout works on your machine.  It is designed\nto be slow and easy; it may graze the left Slingshot, but it should not hit\nit hard enough to activate it.  Try holding up the lower left flipper for a\nsimple catch.  I found that this would work about half the time, with the\nball bouncing over to the right flipper the rest of the time.  Because of the\nslow speed of the kickout, I would not recommend trying to let it bounce over\nto the lower right flipper.  Depending on the condition of the flipper\nrubbers, you may be able to use a dead catch (drop as the ball hits the\nflipper).\n\nMr. DNA will be lit at least once in the course of a typical game, and he's\nquite worth shooting for on a machine that is not in Tournament Mode, as some\nof the awards are quite lucrative.\n\nI have never lit or collected an Extra Ball from the Ramp.\n\nI wasn't shooting for the Captive Ball in tournament play, but I was usually\nchoosing the Complete Egg award from Mr. DNA, in order to advance the Egg's\nvalue, if nothing else.  Super Egg Mania is interesting but seems to usually\nnot be worth the trouble.\n\nActually going all the way through the Visitor's Center left orbit is\nextremely difficult, for some reason.  Luckily, completing the orbit is only\nnecessary for the Advance X shot.  For this reason, along with the generally\nlow End-Of-Ball Bonus, I cannot recommend ever shooting for Advance X.  At\nthe very least, Hammond's Bunker will be lit at the same time for the Park\nRevenue value.\n\nDeath Saves are extremely easy on Jurassic Park, and should generate no more\nthan one warning (sometimes none, if you're very gentle or your name is\nDallas) on factory settings.  This is one of the best machines on which to\nlearn how to make Death Saves.\n\nNote that the Outlanes on Jurassic Park are protected by posts above the\nentire Inlane/Outlane area.  Use small nudges and slaps as the ball hits\nthese posts to control it, directing it down towards your flippers instead of\ntowards the Slingshots or the opposite Outlane.  Jurassic Park is generally\nvery tolerant of small nudges and slaps; these almost never add up to enough\nmotion to register Tilt warnings (unlike many Williams/Bally games, which\nseem to build up momentum in the pendulum swing).  On the other hand, the\ndefault settings for Jurassic Park include only one Tilt warning, which I\nthink is very unfair for such a (usually) sensitive machine.\n\nJurassic Park machines sometimes randomly Slam Tilt.  I can't adequately\nexplain this.  There are also problems with the T-Rex motors (which can be\nhelped by newer ROMs), the Control Room sensor (bad diode?), and balls\ngetting stuck in the under-playfield ramp that feeds balls to the Super\nVUK that feeds to the Right Inlane.  The solution to this under-playfield\nproblem is to somehow tie the ramp to the underside of the playfield so\nthat it no longer sags and provides a hiding place for balls.  The solution\nto other problems typically involve bending something or soldering something.\n\nAlso, beware of the several seconds after Game Over when the machine goes\ndead (this appears to happen only if there are no Credits remaining).  During\nthis time, the CPU is waiting for the display system to reset, and you will\nnot receive proper credit for coins inserted (at most, only one coin will be\nregistered).\n\nThe Movie\nI've seen it.  Liked it a lot.  The machine follows the movie very closely.\n\nThe Book\nMichael Crichton's book started the entire Jurassic Park affair, of course.\nI've read parts of it.  It's pretty good.\n\nBragging\nI have had countless System Failures (I try to have one every game,\npreferably on ball one :), and lit and collected 400M+ Super Jackpots.  My\nscores on Jurassic Park at the AMOA/IFPA tournament were generally in the\n200-300M range consistently, which was usually enough to win on that machine.\n\nMy local high score is roughly 1300M.  When the Power Shed sensor was faulty,\nmy high score was 674M (work those modes for as much as possible).\n\nMasaya Horiguchi of Data East Japan has completed the CHAOS sequences and\ncollected both 600M+ Super Jackpots *without* using the Smart Missile!\n\nData East Rules\nThis section is an exact copy of Data East's Game & Feature Specifications\npages, as provided to players in the AMOA/IFPA tournament.  All of the\ninformation provided here is indirectly from Data East, and is exactly the\nsame information printed in the game's manual.\n\nDisclaimer: Some parts of this are confusing, and some details have been\nchanged.  For most things, what I have written in previous sections should\nbe considered more authoritative than what is written here.\n\n1) SKILL SHOT\nUse the fire button on the tazer gun to stun the dinosaur running across\nthe display.  The awards are 2M (ball 1), 3M (ball 2), 4M (ball 3).\n\n2) SMART MISSILE\nThe smart missile can only be used once per game and will collect\neverything flashing when used.  For example if extra ball is flashing the\nsmart missile will collect it for the player instead of the player having\nto make the shot on the playfield.  In various features on the computer it\nwill score the next available value.\n\n3) TRI-BALL\nCollect all six target species to complete the map and enable tri-ball lit.\nIn tri-ball lit either feed T-REX or taunt the raptors (3 times 1st\ntri-ball, 5 times 2nd tri-ball, 7 times 3rd tri-ball) then tri-ball can\nonly be started by feeding T-REX.  You are now ready for dual jackpot\naction.\n\n4) DUAL JACKPOTS\nOnce in TRI-BALL, both the helicopter loop and ramp are lit for Jackpot.\nAll switches on the game add their normal score to the progressive Jackpot\nin the display.  To score each of the Jackpots the player must shoot the\nramp and loop.  When one is collected it is scored and the other Jackpot\ncontinues to increase in value until collected.  You are now ready for\nCHAOS lit with both Jackpots collected.\n\n5) CHAOS LETTERS LIT\nAfter scoring dual jackpots the five CHAOS letters are flashing for 5M\neach.  If all letters are completed then the game goes into CHAOS mode.\nScore an additional 10M for completing CHAOS.\n\n6) CHAOS MODE / CHAOS FEED T-REX JACKPOT\nIn CHAOS mode the game will play 6 balls.  The CHAOS letter will again be\nflashing to be completed for 10M per letter.  When the player collects\nCHAOS then T-REX will light for 50M.\n\n7) SUPER JACKPOTS\nWhile still in six ball play and after T-REX has been fed for 50M the\nplayfield jackpots relight for twin SUPER JACKPOTS.  TWIN SUPER JACKPOTS\nscore 100M times the number of balls on the playfield, for up to 600M.  If\nthe player scores SUPER JACKPOTS then the CHAOS letters light again for 10M\nand repeats feed T-REX and SUPER JACKPOTS until all but one ball drains.\n\n8) RAPTOR PIT / WILD RAPTORS\nTHe RAPTOR PIT starts with a set value of 3M and increases by 250K with\nevery shot into the raptor pit.  If the player shoots in and out of the\nRAPTORS rapidly before the danger light stops blinking, then his raptor\nscore will add its initial value onto itself until the chain is broken and\nreturn to the last raptor score prior to wild raptor mode.  When the danger\nlight is on there is a ball freeze protector coming out of the raptor pit.\n\n9) RAPTOR PIT HELD\nYou can holdover the RAPTOR pit value from ball to ball simply by shooting\nthe Helicopter loop twice in a row without missing.  Two loops also\nqualifies T-REX to eat the next time a ball is in the paddock in single\nball play.\n\n10) GENERAL BONUS HELD\nShooting the ramp twice in a row collects and hold bonus over for the next\nball.\n\n11) COMPUTER VALUES\nThe computer has a total of twelve mini games for the player to explore and\nchallenge.  At the start of each ball the control room light above the\ncenter scoop will light.  Entering the control room will award one of the\nlit features.  After a feature is scored the turbo bumpers will randomly\nadvance the next value.  Shooting the power shed (top right scoop) will\nlock in the next value to be scored.  if no value is lit going down the\nright return it will light the control room for a few seconds and\ntemporarily lock the flashing value in place.  If the player scores all\neleven features then SYSTEM FAILURE is ready.\n\n12) ELECTRIC FENCES\nIn this game the player has 20 seconds to make 20 switch closures in the\nturbo bumpers and sling shots to score 30M and save Timmy.  If you don't\ncollect the points Timmy will be electrocuted...\n\n13) SPITTER ATTACK\nIn this game the player has to shoot any of the 3 lit spitter targets on\nthe lower left side of the playfield.  Each shot to the lit spitter target\nmakes the spitter attack Nedry.  The first spit is 5M, the second spit is\n10M and the third spit is 15M.  Three shots prior to the timer expiring\ncollects a total of 3M.\n\n14) 2 BALL PLAY\nIn this round the top right eject is lit (boat dock) for 2 ball play.  When\nthe player makes the shot into the eject the 2nd ball is issued into play.\nThe player's objective is to shoot the Raptor pit frequently in two ball\nplay for Raptor Jackpots.  Raptor Jackpots start at 3M and add an\nadditional 1M for each subsequent shot.\n\n15) SYSTEM BOOT\nIn this round the Bunker, Control Room and Power Shed scoops are lit.  The\nplayer has 20 seconds to score 5M for the first, 10M for the second and 15M\nfor the third completed.  This round can score a maximum of 30M.\n\n16) RAPTORS RAMPAGE\nIn this round the Raptors are loose in the kitchen and are roaming back and\nforth.  The player scores the Raptor value every time he shoots the Raptor\npit in this mode.  The player can extend the time of this feature by\nshooting the raptor pit before the counter expires.\n\n17) LIGHTING EXTRA BALL\nThis feature lights extra ball on the top right eject (boat dock).  The\nplayer collects extra ball by shooting the eject.\n\n18) MOSQUITO MILLIONS\nIn this round the captive ball lights for 20 seconds and starts with a\ntotal value of 5M.  Each and every subsequent shot scores an additional 1M.\n\n19) FEED T-REX\nIn this round the player has 30 seconds to shoot the ball into the T-REX\npaddock and feed T-REX for 25M.\n\n20) BONE BUSTING\nIn this round the player has to shoot the ramp 3 times helping the raptor\nbust the T-REX skeleton in 20 seconds to score 20M.\n\n21) SYSTEM FAILURE\nAfter all computer features are collected the control room and power shed\nlights will be flashing.  If the player shoots either scoop the game will\nstart a 45 second mini-round keeping all six balls on the playfield.  In\nthis round the player scores 1M per switch closure.  After the timer has\nexpired, the flippers are disabled and all six balls are returned to the\ntrough.  The player's System Failure score is added to his existing score\nand a new ball is issued to the playfield and the player continues his ball\nin play.\n\n22) CAPTIVE BALL EGG\nShooting the captive ball cracks the dinosaur egg.  The first egg takes 3\ncracks and scores 5M.  The second egg takes 4 cracks and scores 10M.  The\nthird egg takes 5 cracks and scores 15M.  The fourth egg takes 6 cracks and\nscores extra ball.  The fifth egg takes 6 cracks and scores 20M and the\nsixth egg scores a mystery of either special lit, extra ball lit, or\npoints.  Every seventh egg scores power egg mania.\n\n23) RAMP MOLECULES\nRamp molecules are collected with every ramp shot.  The first three DNA\nstrands take seven shots to collect.  DNA strands 4, 5, & 6 take 8 ramps to\ncollect.  All DNA strands after 6 take 9 ramps to collect. When a DNA\nstrand is complete MR DNA on the bunker scoop is lit for a select pick.  50\nramps light extra ball at the boat dock.  Every ramp adds to the T-REX\npaddock Jackpot.\n\nDNA SELECT VALUES:\n\n\n 5M, 10M, 15M\n Super Pops\n Million Pops\n Complete Egg\n Light Special\n Hurry Extra Ball\n Hurry Score 15-5M\n Hurry 2 Ball 10-5M\n Tri-Ball Ready\n Spitters Double Round\n Advance Bunker 5M\n Raptor Hold\n Bonus Hold\n\n\n24) ESCAPE ISLA NUBAR\nIn this round the player has to try to escape the island by going to the\nvisitors center, heliport and boat dock in any order.  The timer begins to\ncount down points from 20M.  Once the player collects this value, an\nadditional 10M is added to this timer.  The timer again starts to count\ndown the added 10M - if the timer is collected before the added 10M is\nsubtracted, this step may be repeated an additional time.  The maximum\nscore a player can accumulate in this round is 66M.\n\n25) STAMPEDE\nIn this round all switches start scoring 250K and add an additional score\nof 10K to every subsequent switch closure.  If the player shoots the T-REX\npaddock or the Galiminus target in this round he is awarded an additional\n5M.  In the display the T-REX will eat a Galiminus.\n\n26) T-REX PADDOCK JACKPOT\nThe T-REX jackpot starts at 5M; each ramp shot adds 100K to the jackpot\nvalue.  To collect this jackpot you must spell T-REX by shooting the T-REX\npaddock and then feed T-REX.  This value builds ball to ball, player to\nplayer, game to game.\n\n27) VICTORY LAP\nAfter a replay is achieved the ramp will light for 30 seconds.  During that\ntime the player has to shoot the ramp a total of 6 times.  The first 5\nramps are worth 5M and the sixth ramp is worth 25M.

{"page_content": "                 \tBK's PAPA 4 Strategy Guide\n\t\t\t--------------------------\n\t\t   \tData East's Jurassic Park\n\n--- Tournament Settings ---\n\n\tThe letters in T-REX reset at the beginning of each ball, and the T-REX\nBounty also resets to 7.5 million.\n\tPossibly, the ball saver might be turned off.  Also, the saver on\nRaptor Pit kickouts might be off.\n\tMr. DNA awards are fixed.  The first set of awards are 5M, Complete\nEgg, Runaway 2OM.  I don't know the second set, but the third set includes Lite\nTri-Ball and Lite Special.\n\tProbably, it will take more than one Raptor shot to begin Tri-Ball.\n\tNo replays or extra balls.  Collecting a lit \"extra ball\" will award 25\nmillion points.  The \"Lite Extra Ball\" Control Room is still available.\n\tSince there is no replay, there is no \"Victory Lap\" mode.  (Which was:\nshoot the ramp for 5M/shot after you get a replay.)\n\n\n--- Skill Shot ---\n\n\tJP's Skill Shot is a video game; pull the trigger when the dinosaur is\nin your sights.  On balls 2 and 3, the dinosaur will pause briefly before going\nthrough the sights.  Skill shot is 2M for ball 1, 3M for ball 2, 4M for ball 3,\nand any Skill Shot immediately lights Super Pops (1OOK or more per bumper).\n\n\n--- General Strategies ---\n\nTri-Ball: Light Tri-Ball by shooting each of the flashing dinosaur targets,\n\tfound all over the playfield.  At the beginning of balls 2 and 3, three\n\tdinosaur targets will be spotted for you; as a result, Tri-Ball will\n\talways be lit at least once in the game, usually at the start of ball\n\t3.  Dinosaur targets are also spotted at the Boat Dock, after rolling\n\tover the left inlane.\n\n\tIn general, you shouldn't bother with the dinosaur targets.  Tri-Ball\ngets lit anyway, so it's no big deal.\n\n\tWhen Tri-Ball is lit, shooting T-Rex (or Raptor; T-Rex is easier)\nbegins it -- ramp for jackpot (base 15M), loop for jackpot + 15M bonus.  Try to\nget a jackpot as soon as possible to keep all the balls on the table; it isn't\nworth 15 million to try for the more difficult loop unless you have a clean\nshot at it.\n\tAfter a jackpot, you must complete CHAOS to begin six-ball play, and\nyes you want to do that.  C comes from the left sink, H from the bumpers, A\nfrom the Control Room, O from the ramp, and S from the Power Shed sink.  These\nshots can be hard, especially the Power Shed, since it can be blocked by the\nupper right flipper.  Don't be afraid to burn your Smart Missile at this point;\nthere's a lot of points to be made in multiball, and you usually only get one\nchance.  Each letter in CHAOS is worth 5 million at this point.\n\tWhen CHAOS is complete, you begin six-ball play and the five letters\nmust be shot again.  This time, they are each worth 1O million.  Again, the\nPower Shed is the most difficult shot, but the ramp also becomes hard with all\nthe balls bouncing around.  If you get the chance, go for these two shots\nbefore all six balls kick out in the first place, since the other letters are a\npiece of cake.  Each letter is 1O million during six-ball play, and note that\njust starting six-ball play takes care of H when the balls are plunged to the\nbumpers.\n\tOnce all five shots are made, T-Rex lights for 5O million.  Try to trap\nas many balls as you can on the lower right flipper, and make T-Rex by shooting\nthe Boat Dock first (keeping the upper flipper down until necessary).\n\tAfter T-Rex, both Jackpots become lit again -- this time, the ramp is\nworth 1OO million per ball left in play, and the loop is 15 million more than\nthat.  Both jackpots can be collected.  Again, balls on the lower right flipper\nare a good thing, since neither jackpot shot requires it.\n\tAfter that, CHAOS lights up again, and you (hopefully) keep going.\n\n\tLet's review the scoring: Jackpot 15 million.  CHAOS 25 million.  CHAOS\nagain 5O million.  T-Rex 5O million.  Without any Super Jackpot, there's 14O\nmillion points to be made in Tri-Ball, and if you manage the SJ it's a lot more\nthan that.  It's well worth it to waste your missile in Tri-Ball to keep\nyourself on the path toward a Super Jackpot.  Don't waste it, though -- keep in\nmind that the missile won't bring any balls back unless it's the first run\nthrough CHAOS.  Don't waste your missile collecting a jackpot, and don't waste\nit as the last of the six balls are draining.\n\tDefinitely, Tri-Ball is the only way to score anywhere near a billion\non Jurassic Park.\n\n\nControl Room: Basically, the only other strategy in Jurassic Park is to go\n\tthrough the Control Rooms, which are all modes of one kind or another.\n\tSome of them can be pretty lucrative.  Light the Control Room by going\n\tinto the Power Shed, or for a few seconds by either inlane (much\n\teasier).  More than one Control Room mode can be running at a time, so\n\tyou can ignore a mode without it boring you too much.  Here's a quick\n\tdescription of each, and the scoring potential:\n\n- Stampede: First target 3OOK, then 31OK, 32OK, etc.  Go for the bumpers.\n\tScoring potential around 15-2O million; you may as well try it.\n- Escape Island: The most valuable mode there is.  Shoot the bumpers, the Boat\n\tDock, and the loop for a score.  The value starts at 21 million,\n\tcounting down 1M every second, and each shot you make scores the value\n\tand adds 1O million to it.  Potentially, this round can be worth 8O-9O\n\tmillion, and may even be worth using the Smart Missile to complete.\n- Two-Ball: A quick multiball lights at the Boat Dock.  Two balls in play, the\n\tJackpot is lit at the Raptor Pit for 7M, 9M, etc.  Not worth much at\n\tall; you might want to go for bumpers or dinosaur targets or T-Rex\n\tduring the multiball.  Beware when starting Two-Ball: it ends all other\n\tmodes you might have running.\n- Electric Fence: Hit 2O bumpers (slingshots or pop bumpers) in 2O seconds for\n\t3O million.  Depending on the bumpers, this can be easy or impossible.\n\tNote that the bumpers can be hit from any flipper.  If a crowd is\n\twatching you, do NOT complete this mode.\n- Spitter Attack: First shot to left 3 dinosaur targets worth 5M, second 15M,\n\tthird 1OM.  (Not a typo!)  Comparatively easy to complete.\n- System Boot: The three sinks light up.  First shot 5M, second 1OM, third 15M.\n\tSee also \"Fester's Tunnel Hunt.\"  The Power Shed is pretty hard, so\n\tsave it for last.\n- Raptor Rampage: For 2O seconds, the Raptor Pit awards between 5 and 1O\n\tmillion.  Don't bother.\n- Mosquito Millions: For 2O seconds, the Captive Ball is worth 5M, 6M, etc.\n\tDon't bother.\n- Feed T-Rex: All you have to do is shoot T-Rex in 3O seconds for 3O million.\n\tNo big whoop, just take the points.\n- Bone Busting: 3 ramps in 2O seconds for 2O million.  The first two ramps\n\tdon't award much, so unless you're confident you can finish, don't\n\tbother.  The ramp is hard enough to shoot once.\n- Light Extra Ball: duh.  The Extra Ball is, effectively, a very easy 25M at\n\tthe Boat Dock.\n\n\tAfter all 11 Computer Screens are lit, shoot the Control Room for\nSystem Failure.  It lasts 45 seconds and every switch is 1M.  The Smart Missile\nwill award 5O million during this round, but you can do better than that. :)\nA good System Failure is worth around 1OO million, which means you can get\naround 3OO million total from all the modes if you play them all well.  Nowhere\nnear what you can get from Super Jackpots, but nothing to scoff at.\n\n\nEgg Cracking: Shoot the Captive Ball enough times to crack an Egg for points.\n\tTwo ball hits score 5M, then 3 for 1OM, 4 for 15M, etc.  In general, it\n\tisn't a great idea to shoot for the ball since it is a potential drain\n\tshot.  Your choice, of course.\n\n\nMr. DNA: Shooting the ramp three times in the game lights Mr. DNA at the Bunker\n\t(left scoop).  Mr. DNA cycles through three awards, your choice.  In\n\ttournament play (see above), the first set of choices isn't very\n\tlucrative, with the best choice being Runaway 2OM (unless you have\n\tseveral Eggs cracked).  I don't know the second set of choices (it\n\ttakes five, then seven ramps to light Mr. DNA again) but they should be\n\tbetter, and the third set includes Lite Tri-Ball.\n\n\n--- Point-Specific Strategy ---\n\nIf you need...\tTry doing this!\n\n5 million:\tShoot the Raptor Pit or Captive Ball to get a quick score.\n\t\tThese are dangerous though.\n2O million:\tGet the Mr. DNA Runaway award, or start a good Control Room\n\t\tmode.\n5O million:\tTwo Control Rooms or Tri-Ball ought to do it.\n1OO million:\tTri-Ball.  The Escape mode can also bring in a bunch.\n2OO million\n   and over:\tGo for Tri-Ball, and don't be afraid to use up the Smart\n\t\tMissile.  During Tri-Ball is the best time to use it.\n\n\n--- Techniques ---\n\nFlipper Passing: Post transfers works well; the Control Room is a very easy way\n\tto get the ball from the right flipper to the left.  From the left to\n\tthe right, either go for the Power Shed (difficult) or just do the post\n\ttransfer.  You won't need to do this much; the left flipper has all the\n\timportant shots anyway.  The Boat Dock shot gives a nice kickout to the\n\tupper flipper, so the back orbit isn't necessary.\n\nDeath Saves: Not likely -- as usual, it depends on the game's tilt sensitivity,\n\tand games at PAPA tournaments tend to be quite sensitive.  But if you\n\tpull one you'll get 3 million bonus and a way-cool animation!  Yippee!\n\tMay as well try, too -- JP's bonus stinks.\n\nBang Backs: Bang Backs have been done on JP, but I don't recommend them; you're\n\tmore likely to bang the plastic lockdown bar right off!  And believe me\n\tI know this.\n\nNudging: Pretty typical.  Nothing that really tends to bring your ball to an\n\toutlane, except maybe a missed shot at the Bunker.\n\n\n--- Scoring ---\n\n\tAverage scores on JP will probably be around 15O to 2OO million, with\nthe highest scores coming in around 8OO million (those who managed a Super\nJackpot, basically).  Compared to TZ, IJ, and the Gottlieb games, Jurassic Park\nwill be fairly inconsequential in the overall scores.\n\nHigh Scores to Date:\tMasaya Horiguchi (Japan) 2.1 billion\n\t\t\tMany many players\t~1.5 billion\n\n\tHoriguchi scored both 6OO million Super Jackpots without the Smart\nMissile.\n\n\n--- For More Info ---\n\n\tIf you need JP's full rules, get Kevin Martin's rule sheet by anonymous\nftp.  FTP rahul.net; go to the Pinball Archive (cd pub/sigma/pinball) and type\n\"get Rules/jurassic\".\n\tIf you'd like to know the exact tournament settings for JP, or other\ninformation, it should be available at PAPA 4.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Jurassic Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Jurassic Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurassic Park\nPinball Tip Sheet\nCompiled By Jerry Duffy (duffy@mik.uky.edu)\nLAST UPDATE - 30 SEPT 1993\n\n\nThis sheet will outline some of the strategies/hints I've picked up during my\nseveral hours (and dollars) playing JP.\n\nSee \"Sigma's Guide to Jurassic Park\" if you need an explanation of the playfield and/or rules to JP.\n\nRandom \"Shoot Out\":\nAfter killing the dinosaur during the random shoot out that occurs during\nplay, Super Pops are activated. If you have functioning pop bumpers, it might\nbe worth shooting the ball into them, if you have no other shot from the\nright flipper. A lit control room or Mr. DNA should take precedence\nover the super pops though.\n\nAdvance X: (Visitors Center)\n\nThe left orbit shot (Visitor's Center) is a very dangerous, shot IMHO. On all\nJP's I've played, the ball will most of the time hit the piece of rubber\nsticking out above the last pop bumper and come screaming back towards the\nflippers, usually SDTM. If your machine doesn't do this, feel extremely\nlucky.\n\nComputer Screens:\nThere are definitly some CRT rounds that can be ignored. The rounds, for\nthe most part, require making dangerous shots that just aren't worth the\npoints awarded. These are:\n\nMosquito Hard enough shot, and only worth 5M to start. (Sometimes you\ncan hit the captive ball when shooting for the T-Rex saucer.)\nRaptor Rampage  Sometimes the ball saver isn't enough if you drain and the\nball rolls up behind the flippers. (Cool music though.)\nElectric Fence Usually, the bumpers aren't working well enough to generate\nthe 15 hits needed. If yours are, then definitly go for it.\nBone Busting  The ramp is very difficult to hit 3 times in the 20 seconds\nyou are given. (See below)\n\nThen there are the computer screens that are almost to easy to pass up..\nEscape - Can be worth around 70-90M if done correctly. The best way to TRY\nto complete the escape sequence is as follows:\n\n Trap the ball when its shot out of the bunker after starting escape. Shot\nthe boat dock.\n Boat dock saucer kicks the ball out..Make a shot for the helicopter pad.\n Finally, when the ball returns to the upper flipper, shot it into the\npop bumpers.\n\nThis is an ideal situation, of course. Normally, you will miss the\nHelicopter Shot, but will probably will still be able to hit the\npop bumpers, for at least 20-30M.\n\n\nSpitters  An easy 30M, if you get the shots. The ball will get\nsomewhat out of control shooting the Spitter targets, but sometimes\nyou'll get lucky and the ball will fall into the Bunker or (even better)\nthe Control Room.\nSystem Boot  This is a good computer screen because you can collect\npoints while relighting and collecting other CRT's.\nFeed T-Rex  Excellent chance to pick an additional 30M, plus get\nanother letter in T-REX.\n\n\nAnytime you have a shot at a lit control room, take it. Getting system\nfailure should be your first goal of the game. This includes a ramp shot that\ngets returned to the left flipper...Backhand the ball into the control room.\n(The ramp really does nothing useful outside of TriBall, besides light Mr\nDNA. Therefore, multiple ramp shots really aren't worth the trouble.)\n\n\nMULTIBALL ROUNDS: (Raptor 2-Ball, Tri-Ball, CHAOS)\n\n\nRaptor 2-Ball:\nTry to keep one ball trapped at all times, if possible. Wildly shooting at\nthe raptor pit with both balls is likely to net you two quick drains. The\nball saver is active for about the first 10 seconds of two ball. (I assume\nthis adjustable.) After that, even a raptor pit shot that drains will not\nbe returned. I'm not at all sure what increases the raptor jackpot, besides\nhitting the raptor pit. I've had raptor jackpots as high as 19M, and really\nhave no idea why!\n\nTri-Ball:\nHitting the raptor pit is the preferred way to start your first Tri-Ball.\nThis will sometimes allow you an immediate shot at the ramp jackpot, if\nthe ball comes out of the raptor pit just right. During Tri-Ball, every\ntarget increases the Jackpot values. (Some probably more than others.) Always\ntry to keep an eye on the upper half of the machine for a possible double\njackpot shot. The ideal situation is to try to trap one or two balls on the\nright flipper, and hope you get lucky and can get an easy ramp shot from the\nleft flipper. If you start Tri-Ball with TRex, it might be possible to \"speed\npass\" the ball to the left flipper when it is returned from TRex to the right\nflipper. This will allow you a shot at the ramp before the other two balls get\nautolaunched into play.\n\nNote: For a double jackpot, the ball does NOT have to complete the\nhelicopter loop. It's enough to trip the two rollovers in the beginning\nof the loop. It also possible, if you get extremely lucky, to have the\nball go through the helicopter loop in reverse. This will also score the\ndouble jackpot.\n\nIf you fail to score a jackpot during Tri-Ball, you will have 15 seconds for\na two ball restart. Be careful, because when you restart two-ball, there is\nNO ball saver active, even if you hit the raptor pit to restart it.\nAfter your first Tri-Ball, the best way to start subsequent Tri-Balls is\nthe TRex shot.\n\nCHAOS:\nIf your machine has a newer ROM, it will start awarding CHAOS letters\nimmediately after you get a jackpot. If this is the case, try to hit the\nramp for the O and the power shed for S as quickly as possible. After 5-6\nballs get launched, it's next to impossible to get a clean shot at anything\nin the upper half of the playfield. You will probably get the C-H-A letters\nby just flailing around trying to save balls.\n\nIf you machine does not award letters until all balls have been launched,\ntry to trap as many as you can on the flippers until you see the H awarded\nfrom the pop bumpers. You should get the C and A letters easily, but the\nO-S will probably be very difficult unless you only have 2 or 3 balls on\nthe playfield.\n\nIt's been my experience that getting the TRex shot is more or less blind\nluck if you have over 3 balls on the table after spelling CHAOS your\nsecond time. Just make as many shots as you can toward the egg. Eventually,\none of them will bounce into the TRex saucer for 50M. Then comes the\nsuper jackpots. Tri-Ball tips apply here. (And if you have your smart missle\nat this point, use it!)\n\nVictory Ramps:\nWhen you win a replay, the victory ramp feature becomes active. There is an\nodd quirk during Victory ramps that is very helpful. While the victory ramp\ntimer is counting down, all other timers for all other rounds that you had\ngoing at the time of the replay are suspended! This includes any CRT's you\nstart during the victory ramp round. (The only one I am unsure of is System\nFailure...I would think that this would be the one round that the timer\nwould NOT be stopped on.) It has been confirmed that the Victory Ramps\nCANNOT be collected with the smart missile.\n\nSystem Failure:\nObviously, the place to be during System Failure is the pop bumpers. If you\nhave active pops, your system failure total will probably be in 150M range.\nOtherwise, expect totals around 60-80M. Using the smart missile will add\nexactly 50M to your SF score. Be patient after SF ends. Sometimes, JP has\na hard time locating all the balls in the trough. Eventually, a ball will\nbe launched and play will resume normally.\n\nSmart Missile:\nIMO, the smart missile should be saved for (hopefully) your second CHAOS,\nor at the very least to start Tri-Ball on ball three. Another good use\nfor it is to max out the Escape round or if you have three or more good\ncomputer screens running at the same time. (Good meaning you actually score\nsome points from them.)\n\nSend corrections, updates or large sums of American Currency to\nduffy@mik.uky.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Jurassic Park", "possible_shots": "Random \"Shoot Out\", Advance X: (Visitors Center), Computer Screens, Spitters, System Boot, Feed T-Rex, MULTIBALL ROUNDS: (Raptor 2-Ball, Tri-Ball, CHAOS), Victory Ramps, System Failure, Smart Missile", "manufacturer": "Not mentioned", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/jurassicpark-notes2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Jurassic Park", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

You can hear pieces of AC/DC's song \"Big Guns\" if you\nlisten closely.\n\nStarting the Game\nThe lengthy opening animation can be skipped by simply plunging the ball.\nYou plunge the ball into play in two ways...The first way is to pull the\ngun trigger, the second is to flip both flippers at the same time.\n\nImportant Stuff\n\nThis will list important playfield items and shots that will be referred to\nin the discussion of the game. The list will start at the bottom and continue\nclockwise around the playfield.\n\n\nPlunger  An automatic plunger in the shape of a pistol.\nSmart Missile  This is a button located just above the pistol. Hitting it\nwill award whatever is lit on the playfield. (Cannot be used for Skill Shot)\nThe location of the Smart Missile is a real pain to try to hit in a hurry.\nThe best thing to do is use the \"Buddy System.\"  :-)\nFlippers  The only two flippers in the game, in the normal\nplace.\nSlingshots  Two normal slingshots.\nInlanes  Both inlanes light the captive balls for 2X towards lighting\nmultiball.\nOutlanes  Will award special when lit, and deactivate the Smart\nMissile.\nLeft Captive Ball  Located just above the left outlane. Will advance MBALL\nand reset the timer of any mode currently running.\nCRANE Targets  Actual drop targets that are used during various rounds.\nLocated along the left side of the machine. (One for each letter in\nCRANE)\nDanger Bar  Located behind the CRANE targets. Any dropped CRANE target will\nexpose the Danger Bar. Hitting the Danger Bar will reset all the CRANE\ntargets.\nCRANE Lock  This is a place above the CRANE targets that holds balls\nlocked for successfully spelling CRANE and hitting the Crane shot. Two\nballs maximum can be locked at one time. When M-Ball is started, any\nlocked balls for that player are returned, via habitrail, to the\nleft flipper. The machine keeps track of how many balls each player has\nlocked, so it is possible to have \"virtual\" locks if the Crane is broken\nor another player starts M-Ball before you. Also called the Tar\nPit.\nRamp Entrance  The only ramp in the game, often referred to as THE ROOF.\nUsed during various Dynamite Features, scores normal and Super Jackpots and\nto advance progress towards 'Second Cousin Franks' award. Located in the top\nleft corner. The ramp has a large sweet spot, and the ball can be diverted\nto a habitrail to return to the left or right flipper.\nCAT Target  A red target located on the right post of the ramp. Only used\nduring CAT Millions dynamite feature.\nCrane Shot  Located just to the right of the ramp, this is a passage that will\nlead to a VUK kickout and return the ball, via a habitrail, to the right\nflipper. During certain times, the crane will be in position to catch a\nball kicked out from here. A ball not hit hard enough will fall into one\nof the Double-Your-Bonus rollovers.\nDouble-Your-Bonus Rollovers  Like Advance X on most machines, completing\nthese three rollovers will double your current bonus that is awarded at\nthe end of your ball. (Max of 50M)\nPop Bumpers  Three pop bumpers in the normal triangular arrangement. Located\nat the top of the machine underneath the Double-Your-Bonus rollovers.\nThey advance the currently flashing Dynamite Feature.\nMovie Screen  Scoop located in the upper middle of the playfield, just\nunderneath the pop bumpers. When the yellow light is lit or flashing, it\nwill award the current Dynamite Feature. Also used during some Dynamite\nfeatures and to start M-Ball.\nLt. Dekker Spinner  A spinner target located between the movie screen scoop\nand the Chicken Scoop. A ball going through the spinner will immediately\nenter the pop bumpers.\nChicken Scoop  Located to the right of the spinner. Used to \"Play Chicken\"\nand during some Dynamite Features. The ball can returned to the Chicken\nscoop via a small lane out of the pop bumpers right beside the Ripper\nkickout. (See below) A ball hit into the Chicken scoop will be returned\nfrom the Movie Scoop.\nRipper  A Kickout like the Raptor pit in JP. Hitting the Ripper will return\nthe ball to the flippers at about the speed of light. A ball draining\nshortly after a Ripper shot will be replunged. Also spots a letter in\nRIPPER.\nRight Captive Ball  Captive ball to the right of the Ripper. Advances toward\nM-Ball and used during \"Go to the Movies\".\nEyeball Targets  Three targets on the upper right side of the machine,\njust to the right and underneath the Right Captive Ball. Hitting all three\nwill light another 5M badge on the playfield, and will also award a\n\"Benedict's Bonus\".\nWildcard Scoop  A scoop on the right just above the right outlane. Awards\nWildCard, Extra Ball when lit, and sets the Dynamite feature to one of\n\"Last\", \"Action\", or \"Hero\".\n5M Badges  Badges lit on the playfield at the entrances to certain shots.\nThere locations are: The left captive ball, the Crane, The Ripper, and\nthe Wildcard Scoop. These shots must also be hit during the\n6-Ball sequence.\nDynamite Features  Like most other games these days, LAH has a series of\nmodes to complete. These are the lights just above the flippers. Steady\nlit lights indicate that the feature has been completed. The flashing\nfeature is the next feature to be awarded after a shot to the movie scoop.\nThe pop bumpers change the current award.\nRIPPER Lights  Located on the lower left side of the cabinet. There is one\nlight for each letter in RIPPER. Hitting the Ripper shot adds another letter.\nCompleting RIPPER awards the current RIPPER Bounty.\nSmart Missile Light  A light on the lower right side of the cabinet. It will\nbe flashing throughout your current ball if the Smart Missile is still\navailable to be used.\nMagnet  Yes, LAH does have magnets underneath the playfield, right below\nthe Dynamite Features. The eye of the pyramid below the Movie Scoop will\nbe lit (or blinking) when the magnets are activated. The magnets are in a\ntriangular shape similar to TAF.\nShaker Motor  At various times during the game, a shaker motor will be\nactivated to vibrate the machine for a pretty neat effect. (It's\nidentical to the one in JP.) It comes on whenever the ball enters the\npop bumpers, and when various rounds are in progress.\n\n\nSkill Shot\nThe skill shot on LAH is identical to the one on LW3. A red light underneath\neach of the CRANE targets will will flash in sequence. You must plunge the ball\nso the ball will knock down the currently lit target. It awards:\n\n    Ball 1 : 2M\n    Ball 2 : 3M\n    Ball 3 : 4M\n\n\nInstant Info\nHolding either flipper button for awhile will show you Instant Info. This will\nlist the replay value, number of extra balls earned, current bonus, Second\nCousin Frank's award value, Last Action Hero award value, World Premier\naward value, as well as the High Score table. You can page through the display\nby hitting the other flipper.\n\nBall Saver\nLast Action Hero has a ball saver that is active during the first few seconds\nof a ball being plunged. If you get an outlane drain immediately after hitting\nthe CRANE targets, the ball will be returned. If the replunged ball again\ndrains after hitting the CRANE targets, it will be replunged once again.\nAfter this, your on your own. The ball saver will also be active after a\nshot to The Ripper, the first few seconds of M-Ball and the first moments\nof Super Crane and 6 ball.  \"Don't Move!\"\nNOTE: One newer ROM's, the machine will supposedly forgive many right outlane\ninsta-drains.\n\nDynamite Features\nA few notes about the Dynamite features before I actually start explaining\nthem:\n\nThe Movie Scoop will be lit to award a feature at the start of each ball.\nAfter it's collected, the ramp will relite the scoop. Going through either\ninlane will lit the movie scoop for a VERY limited amount of time.\nYou can have various modes running at the same time, but there are some\nexceptions that will be noted below.\nAs far as I can tell, the Smart Missile does NOT award the currently\nflashing Dynamite Feature. (It lights the scoop for M-Ball)\nUsing the Smart Missile will automatically light M-Ball at the movie\nscoop. If M-Ball is lit, M-Ball will be started.\nWhen M-Ball is ready at the Movie Scoop, Dynamite Features (obviously)\ncannot be collected.\nDuring any kind of timed round, hitting the Left Captive Ball will\nreset the timer back to it's maximum value. This can only be used\nonce per round.\nHitting an inlane during most Dynamite Features will lite the Wildcard\nscoop. Hitting the scoop before it times out will double the current\nscoring for whatever round is going on. This can be VERY worthwhile\non some rounds. (It does not work for every Dynamite Feature.)\nThe World Premier Award (and I think the Last Action Hero Award) are\nincreased in the following way: Every round you successfully complete\nwill add 5M to the World Premier/LAH awards and 5 seconds to your\nWorld Premier time. (See sections on World Premier and LAH for a full\nexplanation of these 2 rounds.) Round Completion will be specified\nfor each Dynamite Feature.\n\n\nThe Dynamite Features are: (In no particular order)\n\nBlow Out\nLight Extra Ball\nGo to the Movies\nRed Eye\nThe Roof\nBig Mistake\nCat Millions\nSuper Crane\nSave Danny\nFind Benedict\n\"Last\"\n\"Action\"\n\"Hero\"\n*World Premier* (Can be collected after all other Dynamite Features are cleared)\n\n\nLight Extra Ball is obvious - once lit, it can be collected at the Wildcard\nscoop. The other rounds will be described in detail.\n\nBlow Out\nThis is a frenzy round in the tradition of TZ's Town Square Madness or JP's\nStampede. You start at a base score of 6M, and the target value starts at\n250K. Every 10 target hits raises the target value by 50K. The points are\nawarded immediatly. A typical Blow Out score will be 17-20M. A ball that spends\na lot of time in the pop bumpers will net a Blow out Score of around 20-30M.\nBlow out lasts for 20 seconds.\n\nThe Maximum switch value is 1M. The maximum Blow Out value is 99M.\nRound completion is specified as having a Blow Out total of over 20M.\n\nHitting the Smart Missile during Blow Out will reset the timer to 20 seconds,\ncredit you with about 30 target hits, and light M-Ball.\n\nGo to the Movies\nThis is an \"Add-a-Ball\" round. During this round, both Captive Balls are lit\nfor 20 seconds. Hitting either captive ball will plunge another ball into play.\nAfter the 20 seconds expires, both captive balls score 5M per hit. The round\nends when all but but one ball drains, or the timer reaches 0 and neither\ncaptive ball has been hit.\n\nHitting the left captive ball will reset the timer for Go ot the Movies to 20\nseconds. I think hitting the Smart Missile will credit you with a captive\nball hit, reset the timer and plunge another ball into play.\nNOTE: No other rounds may be started while Go to the Movies is active, and the\nCaptive ball hits do not advance you towards M-Ball as they normally do.\n\nRound completion is hitting EACH captive ball at least once after the timer\nhas expired.\n\nRed Eye\nIn this round, the objective is to hit the Eyeball targets 3 times for 30M\npoints. The first hit scores 5M, the second 10M, and finally 15M for the last\nEyeball hit.\n\nThe Smart Missile will award the next point value that would have resulted\nin a real hit to the Eyeball targets. (In other words, the Smart Missile\nwill NOT award the complete 30M like the JP Smart Missile would.)\n\nRound completion is hitting the Eyeball targets 3 times.\n\nThe Roof\nThe point of this round is to make 3 ramp shots in the 20 seconds given.\nRamp #1 is worth 5M, the second is worth 10M and the final ramp is 15M.\nThe ball will be diverted to the right inlane after every successful\nRoof shot.\n\nThe Smart Missile will award the next point value that would have resulted\nfrom a real ramp shot.\n\nCompletion is hitting all three ramps.\n\nBig Mistake\nHere, you have three targets you must hit, in order. You have 20 seconds to\ndo this. The targets are:\n\n Any CRANE targets for 5M\n Any Eyeball target, for 10M\n The Movie Screen scoop, for 15M\n\n\nAgain, the Smart Missile will award the active target value, and not\nall three.\n\nCompletion is hitting all three targets for the maximum of 30M.\n\nCat Millions\nDuring this round, the display will show a little mouse (I think) jumping\nacross various point amounts. Hitting the Cat target will award the amount\nthe mouse is currently sitting on. After hitting the target, another mouse\nis added, so hitting the target the next time will award 2 Cat Millions\nvalues, and so on. The values on the display are:\n5M  6M  7M  8M  9M  10M  9M  8M  7M  6M  5M\n\nA maximum of three values can be lit at once.\nThe Smart Missile will award the currently lit value(s).\n\nCompletion is getting at least three hits on the Cat target.\n\nSuper Crane\nSuper Crane is a 6 ball multiball round. The only goal during Super Crane\nis to hit the Crane Shot and the CRANE targets. No other rounds can be\nstarted during Super Crane, but I believe that rounds that were going when\nsuper crane was started will continue. (Check me on this.)  The Crane has\nan initial value of 5M and and a timer of 20 seconds. Everytime you hit\nthe Crane, the value goes up by 5M. After the initial 20 seconds is up,\nyou must hit all the CRANE targets to relight the Crane. The value of the\nCrane will be at whatever it was before the timer expired. If you hit the CRANE\ntargets to relight the Crane, then the Crane stays lit until you hit it.\n(No timer.) You continue the process of hitting the CRANE targets, then\nthe Crane until all but one ball drains.\n\nThe Smart Missile will award the current crane value, or relight the Crane\nif wasn't lit already.\n\nCompletion is defined as getting a Crane Jackpot after the initial timer\nexpires. (Hitting all CRANE targets then hitting the Crane.)\n\nSave Danny\nThis is a hurry up round. You must shoot the Crane shoot to save Danny from\nfalling off the Crane. The value starts at 20M and bottoms out at 3M. Shooting\nthe Crane awards the current value and saves Danny from certain doom.\n\nThe Smart Missile collects the current save Danny award.\n\nCompletion is obviously saving Danny.\n\nIt's fun to watch Danny fall to his death. Listen for the realistic\nSPLAT as he hits the ground in a bloody mess! :-)\n\nFind Benedict\n\"In this world, the bad guys can win.\"\n\nThe object here is to search for Benedict in the three scoops. The game\nrandomly picks one at the start of the round, and I have found no pattern\nto where Benedict is 'placed'. Hitting an incorrect scoop will show that\ndoor opening on the display, and a large dog running out after you.\nFor finding Benedict, you get 30M, and some really cool animation.\n\nCompletion is finding Benedict for 30M.\n\n\"Have a nice day.\"  BANG!\n\n\"LAST\" \"ACTION\" \"HERO\"\nHitting the Movie scoop when LAST, ACTION or HERO is lit will award 10M\npoints, and spot you that word. Completing LAST ACTION HERO will\nstart a 6 Ball sequence described below. If the currently flashing Dynamite\nFeature is something other than LAST, ACTION or HERO, a shot to the Wildcard\nscoop will automatically set the Dynamite Feature to the next unlit word\nin LAST ACTION HERO.\n\nCompleting LAST ACTION HERO will award a Last Action Hero bonus. As far as I\nknow, this award is based on the number of rounds you successfully complete\nbefore starting LAH.\n\nNow the fun begins. You are initially given 25 seconds on the clock, and\nthe display will say \"50 hits required\". All six balls will be put into\nplay, and the object is to hit 50 targets in the time remaining. Doing so\nwill award the score in the display located underneath the number of targets\nyou have to hit. (It usually starts at about 15M.) Successfully getting\n50 hits will add more time to the timer (I think 8-9 seconds..) and you\nwill be required to get 50 more target hits. The award value continues\nwhere it was previously, and every target hit adds to the total.\nObviously, this can result is big points. Any ball that is lost will be\nimmediately replunged. The award value will wrap back around to 0 after\nit reaches 99M. Also be warned that if you somehow get over 99 seconds\non the timer, the round is ended because the timer wraps around to 0\nas well! (I've had this happen with a sling shot that went crazy.)\n\nIf you keep 1 or 2 balls going through the Lt. Dekker spinner and into the\npop bumpers, this round can go on for quite sometime. I've had a LAST\nACTION HERO round last well over 10 minutes, and scored over 4B points\nduring it.\n\nWhen the timer reaches 0, the flippers, pop bumpers and slingshots go dead.\nCheck out the display during this period. (\"Balls Draining...\") When the\ngame has accounted for all the balls, Arnold will say \"Ready!\" and a ball\nwill be autoplunged into play.\n\nEvery completion of the 50 switch closures adds 5M to the World Premier\nAward and 5 seconds to the timer.\n\nWorld Premier\nAfter collecting all Dynamite Features, (including LAST ACTION HERO) the\nFeatures will start flashing, and the yellow light above the Movie Scoop\nwill be flashing. Hitting the scoop will start World Premier.\n\nFirst, you are awarded the World Premier value. Like the Last Action Hero\naward, it is based on how many rounds you complete, and how well you did\nduring the LAH round.\n\nNext the display will show a display of a movie theater with people\ngoing inside. On the bottom of the display, it will say \"People Seated\" and\n\"Maximum Seating Capacity\". During this time, any ball shot into the\nMovie scoop will award 1M times the number of people listed by\n\"People Seated\". You can hit the scoop as many times as you wish, there by\ncollecting a nice chunk of points every time. When the \"People Seated\" is\nequal to the \"Maximum Seating Capacity\", the round ends.\n\nThe \"Maximum Seating Capacity\", as explained above, is a function of how\nmany rounds are completed when World Premier begins.\n\nChicken Scoop\n\"Let's play chicken.\"\n\nA shot to the Chicken scoop will show your current number of chicken scoop\nshots, and how many shots till the next award. After the award is collected,\nyour chicken scoop shots are reset, and you will have to hit the scoop\none more time than you did previously to achieve the next award.\nThe awards are as follows:\n\n2 shots -  5 Million\n3 shots -  10 Million OR Extra Ball\n4 shots -  15 Million OR Light Special (At the outlanes)\n\n\nAfter achieving 4 shots, the remaining awards are always 15M, I think. I have\nnever personally gotten passed the 4 award. The extra ball that could be\nawarded after 3 shots is based on the machines EB percentages. Same goes\nwith the Special being lit.\n\nSecond Cousin Frank's\nThe Second Cousin Frank's award is an award that is held over from game to\ngame until it is collected. Collecting the award will reset its value\nto 3M. Shots that add points to the award are ramp shots and when the\nball returns to the Chicken Scoop via the little pathway to the left of\nthe Ripper. I believe the value added in both cases is 100K.\n\nHitting a ramp shot that does not light the Dynamite Feature grid will\nshow on the display \"Second Cousin Frank's\", a playing card being flipped\nover, and the current award value. The ball will be returned to the right\nflipper. You now must hit the ramp again. The ball is now returned to the\nleft flipper. Now shoot the Chicken Scoop to collect the award. This is\nreferred to as the \"Center Scoop\" on the display.\n\nTo summarize: 2 consecutive ramp shots, then a shot to the Chicken Scoop. The\nball must hit nothing else after the second ramp shot except the Chicken\nscoop, or the sequence is canceled. Check out the animation for collecting\nSecond Cousin Frank's.\n\nM-BALL\n\"Jack Slater can't lose!\"\n\nM-Ball is lit after a certain number of captive ball hits have been achieved.\nGoing through an inlane will light the captive balls to award 2X the number\nof hits. (Which means you get 2 hits counted for only one captive ball shot.)\nWhen the correct number of captive ball hits are achieved, the Movie scoop\nwill be lit for M-Ball.\n\n\nLOCKING BALLS\nKnocking down all the CRANE targets will start Runaway Crane, and light\nthe Crane lock. Runaway crane is a hurry-up shot that counts from 10M down\nto 3M. Regardless if you collect the Runaway Crane award, the Crane lock\nwill remain lit. Hitting the Crane while the lock is lit will make the\ncrane move underneath where the ball is returned, catch the ball, and move\nit to the lock area where it will be held until M-Ball is achieved. The\ngreen lights on the lock area will tell you how many balls you have locked.\n(Even though the balls might not actually be there.) Knocking down the\nCRANE targets after two balls are locked will award a 7M Crane bonus.\nNOTE: On hard settings, crane locks will time out if not hit before the\nRunaway crane value reaches 0.\n\nSTARTING M-BALL\nHitting the movie scoop begins M-Ball. Two balls are plunged, and any locked\nballs you have are released. (If you have \"Virtual\" locked balls, those\nwill be autoplunged as well). The base jackpot value starts at 15M plus\n5M for every ball you locked prior to M-Ball. (Maximum 25M jackpot).\nEvery target on the playfield adds to the jackpot value, some more than\nothers. Shoot the ramp to collect the current jackpot.\nNOTE: On hard settings, you must hit the crane to light the Roof Jackpot.\n\nAfter the jackpot is collected, the Crane will be lit for double the\ncollected jackpot value. You have 10 seconds to collect this. If you\nfail to hit the crane in this 10 second period, you must shoot the crane\nto relight the normal jackpot. Scoring the double jackpot starts 6-Balls.\n(See Below.)\n\nRESTART\nIf you drain all but one ball without collecting the Jackpot, the movie\nscoop will be lit for a 2 ball restart for 10 seconds. Hitting the\nscoop will restart M-Ball with a jackpot value of 10M.\n\n6 BALLS\nAll six balls are launched into play. The object of 6 Ball is to first\ncollect all the 5M badge shots on the playfield. The display keeps track\nof which badges you have collected, and which still have not been spotted.\n(See above for locations of the 5M Badge shots).\n\nHitting the 4 badge targets will then light the crane for 30M. Hitting\nthe crane will once again light the 5M badge targets, which again must\nbe completed. After the badge shots have been made, the ramp is lit\nfor a Super Jackpot of 50M times number of balls left in play. Collecting\nthat lights the Double Super Jackpot at the crane for 100M times the number\nof balls in play. You have 10 seconds to collect this jackpot. After you\ncollect the Double Super Jackpot or it times out, the process starts all\nover again with the 5M badge targets, Super and Double Super Jackpots.\n\n6 Balls ends whenever all but one ball drains.\n\n\nEnd Of Ball Bonus\nThe end of ball bonus is a function of how many targets you hit during the\nball (10K a piece), and the \"Double-Your-Bonus\" rollovers. Lighting all\nthree of the \"Double-Your-Bonus\" rollovers doubles your current bonus. The\nend of ball bonus tops out at 50M. The bonus starts at 1M at the start\nof each ball. There is no bonus hold or bonus multiplier.\nNOTE: Hitting the flipper buttons during bonus countdown gives a cool\nmotorcycle like revving sound, and goes to the next ball.\n\nOther Stuff\n\nRIPPER Bounty  Every shot into the Ripper spots a letter in RIPPER. Completing\nRIPPER collects the current Ripper Bounty, which is kept between balls,\nplayers, and games. A ball that drains shortly after a Ripper shot will\nbe returned.\nPop Bumpers  They automatically start out at 100K per hit. Super Pops can be\nactivated, although I'm not sure exactly when. Super Pops score 100K and\n1M for every 3rd hit.\nLt Dekker Spinner Award  A shot through the spinner will award 50K for\nfor every turn the spinner takes. Usually about 400K - 500K per shot\nthrough the spinner. \"Slater!\" (See below for Super Dekker Spinner.)\nBenedict's Eyeballs  Hitting all three of the Benedict Eyeball targets will\naward a 20K \"Benedict Bonus Boost\". (This means every switch closure is now\nworth 10K more bonus than previously. The switch value is initially 10K.)\nShooting the craneShooting the crane 5 times in a row will automatically score 10M and lock\na ball for M-Ball.\nCRANE Targets  Knocked down CRANE targets will reset if not all the targets\nare knocked down within a certain amount of time. This can be frustrating\nduring rounds like Super Crane.\nDeath Save  A ball that drains down an outlane but is returned into play\nawards 3M and a picture of the Grim Reaper.\n\n\nCombo Shots\n\n  Crane -> Ramp -> Ramp -> Right Captive Ball\nAwards 4 M-Ball advances and 10M.\n  Crane -> Ramp -> Ramp -> Ripper\nSpots 3 RIPPER letters and awards 10M.\n  Dekker Super Spinner - This is started by hitting a Ramp -> Ramp pair\n5 times. The spinner is then worth 1M per spin the next time you hit\nit.\n\n\nTips and Tricks\nA ball kicked out of the movie scoop should be an easy catch. The machine\nI play kicks the ball out nice and slow. This is very worthwhile since you\ncan immediately hit the ramp and relight the next Dynamite Feature.\n(Especially helpful if you are trying to get LAST ACTION HERO completed.)\n\nThere are some Dynamite Features that are best ignored, IMHO. On the top of\nthe list is Go to the Movies. It is not very point rich, and prevents\nANYTHING else from being awarded. Find Benedict is another which isn't\nworth the trouble most of the time. It would be better if you got SOME\npoints for shooting a scoop where Benedict wasn't hiding. As it is now,\nall you get is a nice display that says \"Not Here!\"\n\nFor the most part, the remaining Dynamite Features are worth the time\nto complete. Blow Out can be especially nice if you hit the Left Captive\nBall to reset the timer late in the round.\n\nBy far, the biggest scoring opportunity is during the LAST ACTION HERO\nsequence. This can be much more point rich than even the Super Jackpots\nand Double Super Jackpots. You just have to make some early shots into\nthe pop bumpers to achieve the first 50 hits as soon as possible. If you\nhave a good LAH sequence going, and you KNOW your going to run out of time\nbefore getting the required number of hits, burn your Smart Missile. This\nwill immediately credit you with 50 hits and add more seconds to the\ntimer.\n\nIf you hit the wildcard scoop to set the dynamite feature to LAST, you\nshould be able to collect all three in order. You will hit the Movie Scoop,\nthe ramp, repeat until LAH is spelled. Also be aware that a ball returned\nfrom a crane shot will light the Movie scoop briefly (if its not already\nlit).\n\nIf you have a ball trapped on the left flipper, and nothing to shot for,\nyou should be able to backhand the crane shot with some success. This\nwill set you up to collect the next dynamite feature.\n\nFor M-Ball, it's definitely to your advantage to lock 1 or 2 balls before\nbeginning M-Ball. This makes the Double Jackpot even more worthwhile.\n\nIf at all possible, try to save your Smart Missile for 6-Ball play. I usually\ntry and get the first set of 5M badges myself, then shoot the crane for\n30M, and then use the Smart Missile. This will light the ramp for Super\nJackpot.\n\nFortunately, the crane being broken (as often is the case) does not hurt\ngame play at all. In fact, it might work to your advantage since the\nball gets returned nicely to the right flipper instead of being locked\nand having another ball launched wildly into play.\n\nBragging\nMy best score on LAH to date has been 6.9B with a sensitive tilt.\nThat was with a huge LAST ACTION HERO sequence as well as over 400M in\nWorld Premier points.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\n Deena Newman  - Proofreader and fellow pin-head.\n Kevin Martin  - For \"use\" of his LAH manual. :-)\n Joel Iott     - Various additions.\n\n\n\"I'll be back.\"\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Last Action Hero", "possible_shots": "Plunger, Smart Missile, Flippers, Slingshots, Inlanes, Outlanes, Left Captive Ball, CRANE Targets, Danger Bar, CRANE Lock, Ramp Entrance, CAT Target, Crane Shot, Double-Your-Bonus Rollovers, Pop Bumpers, Movie Screen, Lt.

Thanks!\n\n\nAbbreviations:\n--------------\n\nFotR MB - Fellowship of the Ring Multiball\nTTT MB - The Two Towers Multiball\nRotK MB - Return of the King Multiball.\nPotD - the Paths of the Dead\nVUK - Vertical Upkicker\n\n--------------------\n  Playfield layout\n--------------------\n\nStarting with the flippers and going clockwise:\n\nTwo flippers - Standard position.\n\nLeft slingshot - Standard position.\n\nLeft inlane - lights first E in K-E-E-P. Inlane/outlane divider post ships\nwith no rubber.  Rubber can be easily added, however. Also lights \"Spot\nRing\" target (see Rings).\n\nLeft outlane - lights K in K-E-E-P.  Has adjustable post on left side.\nGames ship with post in highest (most difficult) position.\n\nThe Shire - Also known as Hobbiton. Big open area on left, similar to\nMedieval Madness's Catapult shot.  Instead of a gate, this area is recessed\nto keep shots in.  Balls can get here either from the playfield, or from\nthe Paths of the Dead.  Can be lit for Mystery (see Rings). Can award\nSouls (see RotK MB).  Can award Sam (see FotR MB).\n\nLeft orbit - Shots here normally travel around the left orbit, across the\ntop of the playfield and into Barad-Dur (upper-right eject). During certain\nmodes, the game will raise a post to divert balls into Orthanc. Weak shots\nwill continue around, under Barad-Dur and around the right orbit. Weaker\nshots fall into the O-R-C lanes.  Very weak shots fall into the Orthanc VUK\nwithout the assistance of the post.  This shot can be lit for a Gift of the\nElves (see Gifts of the Elves), as well as Pippen (FotR MB).\n\nLeft ramp - Feeds left inlane via wireform.  This ramp awards Legolas\n(FotR MB). Can be lit for a Ring (see Rings)\n\nOrthanc Tower - VUK located behind left ramp.  Can be accessed via either\norbit (with help from a diverter post), or from the inner orbit shot if\nthe diverter is open.  This VUK feeds the Paths of the Dead.\n\nInner orbit - Shot located between the left ramp and the Ring ramp. Awards\nGandalf (FotR MB). Shots here normally travel around the right orbit. The\nball will usually lose a bit of momentum around the right side, but can\noccasionally come around VERY quickly.  Weak shots will fall into the O-R-C\nlanes.  The \"made\" switch for this shot is the gate just around the first\nbend, so these weak shots count as successful inner orbits. Can be lit for a\nRing (see Rings).\n\nRing Ramp - Brass-plated metal ramp located roughly in the middle of the\nplayfield, slightly off-center to the left.  Has a spinner at the entrance.\nThis ramp extends over the inner orbit, and ends apprx 2 inches away from\nthe Ring in the backboard. Strong shots will jump the ramp and make it\ninto the Ring.  Weak shots will fall off the end of the ramp, into the\nupper orbit area and into Barad-Dur or the O-R-C lanes. This shot awards\nFrodo (FotR MB).\n\nBalrog - Large red Balrog toy located in the middle of the playfield.\nNormally is parked out of the way, between the Ring Ramp and Gollum's Cave.\nDuring some modes, it will swing out and block the Ring Ramp.  Shots to the\nBalrog MUST hit the center part of the figure firmly - hitting the posts on\neither side does not count, and weak hits will also not count. The\nBalrog pivots and must pivot enough to close the switch.\n\nThe Ring - Large ring in the backboard.  This shot can only be made by\njumping the Ring Ramp into it. The Ring is equipped with a magnet that will\ngrab the ball - the spinner switch triggers the magnet for a brief time\nto assist shots to the Ring.  This shot awards Frodo towards FotR MB.\nThe Ring also starts Modes (see Ring Modes). The magnet can drop the ball\neither out the front (usually if the Ring wasn't lit for anything), or pull\nit through the Ring, where it will exit to the right, down the Gollum\nwireform and eventually to the right inlane.\n\nPalantir - White target located to the right of the Ring Ramp.  Can award\nmystery awards when lit (see Palantir).  Shots from the left flipper can\neasily rebound SDTM.\n\nGollum's Cave - otherwise known as the Right VUK - this is the VUK located\nbetween Palantir and the right ramp. Balls can get here either from the\nflippers, or from the jet bumpers just above it.  Balls shot from the\nflippers can easily go over the saucer and into the jets.  Rules for\nscoring lit awards are as follows: If the ball enters from the flippers\nand sticks, lit awards are scored.  If the ball is shot from the flippers,\ngoes through the VUK and into the jets, then back into the VUK, you get\nthe award.  You do NOT get the award if the ball arrives to the jets via\nany orbit, Ring Ramp or Barad-Dur, and then goes into Gollum. This VUK\ncan be lit for Gollum Multiball, Extra Ball, Special, and Gimli (FotR MB).\nIt will also award \"Super\" modes (see Gollum's section).  This VUK feeds\nthe right ramp sword which feeds the right inlane.\n\nJet Bumpers - three of them, located under the O-R-C lanes and above\nGollum's Cave.  They have red flashers.  Scoring enough bumper hits will\naward Boromir (FotR MB).\n\nO-R-C lanes - Three rollover lanes above the jet bumpers.  Completing\nO-R-C increases the bonus multiplier. Lit lanes can be rotated with the\nflippers.\n\nBarad-Dur - Eject hole located in the far upper-right of the playfield,\nsimilar to Terminator 2. Has a model of Barad-Dur over it.  Can be shot\nfrom the left orbit, or sometimes by luck as missed Ring shots dribble\ndown into it.  This re-lights Palantir and awards other bonuses\n(see Barad-Dur).\n\nRight ramp - otherwise known as the Sword Ramp or Aragorn. Shots here will\nusually hit a target at the ramp U-turn, then come back down a reproduction\n\"sword\" metalform. The \"made\" switch for this shot is under the hilt of\nthe sword, so the white target isn't essential to making this shot.  Can\naward Aragorn (FotR MB), TTT MB locks and TTT MB start.  This ramp feeds\nthe right inlane.  The sword metalform holds locked balls with a nylon\npost. If a ball is shot here when lock is not lit, and there are locked\nballs held by the post, the game will release a locked ball as soon as the\nfirst ball closes the \"shot made\" switch.  If there are locked balls here\nand a ball comes from Gollum's wireform, the game will release a locked\nball as soon as the switch just below Gollum's VUK is made.  Be ready for\nthese releases.  Can be lit for a Ring (see Rings).\n\nRight orbit - Shots here orbit around the left orbit and back to the\nflippers.  Weak shots will fall into the O-R-C lanes or Orthanc. Awards\nMerry (FotR MB).  Note that very weak shots that close the first switch,\nthen roll back and close the switch again will count as \"made\" and award\nany lit items.  Bug?  Can be lit for a Ring (see Rings).\n\nSpot Ring target - large white target along the side of the playfield,\nbelow the right orbit.  Spots one Ring (Elf, Dwarf, Man) when lit.\n\nRight slingshot - standard position.\n\nRight outlane - Lights P in K-E-E-P.\n\nRight inlane - Lights second E in K-E-E-P. No rubber here from the factory\non the divider post. Shots to the left orbit from a right inlane feed are\ndiverted to Orthanc.\n\nRing display - Just above the flippers, three concentric circles display\nhow many Elf, Dwarf and Man rings are collected.  See Rings for more\ninformation.\n\nPlunger lane - Auto/manual plunger.\n\n\n---------------\n  SKILL SHOTS\n---------------\n\nSkill shots are lit on any ball plunged to the shooter lane EXCEPT balls\nsaved by a ballsaver, and the plunge immediately after a successful Ring\ndestruction. There are three skill shots: lanes, tower and flipper:\n\nLane - Plunge the ball softly into the flashing O-R-C lane. Awards +5X\nbonus multiplier if made.  Lit O-R-C lane can be moved via flippers.\n\nTower - plunge a bit stronger to drop the ball into Orthanc. This awards\n250K plus 50K for each successive made tower skillshot. Also good\nfor a free trip to the PotD.\n\nFlipper - Plunge strong to go all the way around the left orbit, then\nshoot the right orbit from the flipper.  Good for 1.25M for the\nfirst shot, increasing by ????? for successive shots.\n\n\n---------\n  RINGS\n---------\n\n  +-+--------------------------------------------------------+-+\n  +-+                                                        +-+\n  |       Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,       |\n  |     Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,     |\n  |             Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,             |\n  |          One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne          |\n  |        In the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.        |\n  |      One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,     |\n  |  One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them  |\n  |         In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.       |\n  +-+                                                        +-+\n  +-+--------------------------------------------------------+-+\n\nCollecting Rings:\n\nFour shots (left and right ramps, inner orbit and right orbit) have three\nRing inserts each, one for Elf, one for Dwarf and one for Man. While no\nmodes or multiballs are in effect (except Gollum MB), each of these shots\nwill have one of the three inserts lit. Hitting that shot will award one\nRing of the type that was lit, and light all other shots for a short combo\nattempt to collect two more of (usually) the ring type just collected. Ex:\nPlayer shoots left ramp, which is lit for a Dwarf Ring.  This adds one\nDwarf Ring, and lights every shot (via the red arrows) for two more Dwarf\nRings.  The combo attempt times out after a few seconds, at which point\nvarious Rings will again be lit at each of the four shots.  When lighting\nRing, the game tends to favor Rings the player needs more.  Hitting the\n\"Spot Ring\" target will award one ring of random type.  The left inlane\nwill re-light this target - it remains lit until collected. Combo rings\nscore increasing values, depending on the type of Ring.\n\nNote: if Mode Start is not lit, hitting the center Ring shot will award\none Elf Ring.\n\n\nRing Awards:  Collecting all Rings of a type (3 Elf, 7 Dwarf, 9 Man) will\naward the following:\n\nElves: Lights Mode Start at center Ring shot (see Modes)\nDwarves: Lights MYSTERY at the Shire (see Mystery)\nMan: Lights Gollum Multiball at Gollum's Cave. (see Gollum MB)\n\n\nOnce an award is lit, Rings of that type can still be collected, but they\nsimply award points until the lit award itself is collected, which resets\nthe Ring count of that type.  If you combo a Ring type that you have\nalready completed, some shots will be lit for combos but for other\nRing types instead.\n\n\nRing Frenzy:\n\nCollecting all of each Ring type at least once (3 Elven, 7 Dwarven and\n9 Man) will start Ring Frenzy.  This is a single-ball hurryup mode with\nthe following shots and rules:  Each of the three inserts at each of the\nfour Ring shots will begin pulsing, the main Ring shot up the middle\nis lit for Jackpot, and a ten-second timer starts.  Each shot to any of\nthe four Ring shots collects an insert and lights it solid, awarding\n100K for the first insert, 125K for the second and 150K for the\nthird. Collecting any insert also resets the ten-second timer.\nThese points are also added to the main Ring jackpot, which starts\nat 600K.  Completing all three inserts on any shot \"finishes\" that shot,\nand increases the main Jackpot multiplier by one, to a maximum of 5 (all\nfour shot sets complete).  Shooting the main Ring collects the Jackpot at\nwhatever value and multiplier it was increased to, and ends Ring Frenzy.\n\nNote that it is possible to have all Rings lit in the LED display, but not\nget Ring Frenzy.  How is this so?  Each collection of Man, Dwarf and Elf\nrings counts towards only one Frenzy. Once Frenzy has been awarded, EACH\nof the corresponding playfield Ring awards (Gollum MB, Mystery and Mode Start)\nMUST be re-collected to reset that race's Ring count.  Frenzy will not be\nawarded until ALL rings are recollected - lit rings from the \"last\" Frenzy\nthat haven't been reset by collecting the playfield award will not count.\n\nRing Bonus:  The spinner on the main Ring ramp increases the Ring Bonus\n1000 points per spin. Shooting the main Ring when it is not lit for a mode\nwill award this bonus.  Ring Bonus normally resets after each ball, but some\nmystery awards will hold it.\n\n\n---------\n  MODES\n---------\n\nSix modes are listed on the plastic surrounding the center Ring, two from\neach of the three movies. Hitting either flipper will change the currently\nselected mode.  If Mode Start is lit on the center shot (from three Elf\nrings), shooting the Ring starts the currently selected mode.  The game\nwill hold the ball in the Ring while the mode intro is displayed, although\noccasionally the ball will escape and fall onto the playfield during the\nintro.  Any mode intro can be aborted by the flippers.  Modes are exclusive -\nonly one can run at a time.  Once it is finished, the player must collect\nthree Elf rings to re-light Mode Start.  After the into is displayed, the\nball is sucked through the Ring, eventually fed to the right inlane.\n\nCompleting a mode successfully will light a Gift of the Elves (see Elf Gifts)\n\n\nModes are as follows:\n\nEscape the Ringwraiths:\nThis mode is a hurryup mode. During the entire mode. two shots are always\nlit - the current 'destination' and the right ramp. 1,000,000 appears on the\nscreen and quickly begins to count down.  The player must hit the flashing\n'destination' shot before this countdown expires.  Shooting the right ramp\n(always lit) at any time adds approximately 200,000 to the countdown.\nShooting the flashing 'destination' shot completes it and awards the current\ncountdown value, then adds approximately 200,000 to the value and lights the\nnext 'destination' shot.  The shots are:  right VUK, inner orbit, left ramp,\nand finally the right ramp to finish.  If the countdown bottoms out\nat 200,000, the mode ends unsuccessfully.  There is a short grace period at\nthe end of this countdown.\n\nGandalf vs Saruman:\nHelp Gandalf battle Saruman.  Both ramps begin lit - the player must shoot\nfour ramp shots, scoring 250K, 500K, 750K and 1M.  Any ramp shot\nimmediately following a previous ramp shot scores double, so the last three\ncould possibly be 1M, 1.5M and 2M. After these four shots, Orthanc will be\nlit for 1.25M.  Next, a roving shot will light, starting at Gollum's Cave.\nThis shot is worth 1.5M.  Finally, Orthanc will re-light to finish the mode\nfor 2M. A 30 second timer runs - if this timer expires, the mode ends\nunsuccessfully.\n\nWarg Battle:\nThis mode begins with another 30 second timer, and the left ramp lit.\nShooting the left ramp awards 300K, kills a Warg, then lights all seven main\nshots (excluding The Shire), for Wargs.  Each shot kills one Warg and unlights\nthat shot.  Warg values increase 100K each successful shot.  Kill all Wargs\nto finish successfully.  If the timer expires, the mode ends unsuccessfully.\n\nWar of the Ents:\nShoot Orthanc to help the Ents flood Saruman's orc factory. Both outer\norbits and the inner orbit are lit (the inner orbit diverter opens up to allow\nshots directly into Orthanc).  Outer orbit shots score 750K, while shots\ndirectly to the Tower are worth 500K. Shoot six shots into Orthanc to win.\nNote that this mode is a great way to collect Souls, as each Orthanc shot\nis fed to the Paths of the Dead. Once again, a 30 second timer runs; if time\nexpires, the player loses the battle, and the mode.\n\nAttack of Shelob:\nDon't let Frodo become spider food! Three shots will light on the left side\nof the playfield - left orbit, left ramp and the inner orbit.  Hit any of\nthese to score 500K. Now, three shots light on the right - Gollum's cave,\nright ramp and right orbit.  Shoot any of these for another 500K.  Now, the\nlit shots move back to the left, less the shot you just hit. Either of the two\nremaining shots are worth 750K and switch sides back to the right, again less\nthe shot you hit the first time.  Score either right-side shot for 750K, at\nwhich point your last left-side shot lights for 1M. Shoot it, then the\nremaining right-side shot for 1M to kill the spider and win the mode.  At all\ntimes, Shelob is chasing Frodo on the display, slowly gaining on our poor\nHobbit.  Scoring a lit shot will give Frodo more breathing room.  If too much\ntime elapses between scoring lit shots, Shelob catches Frodo, enjoys a warm\nmeal, and the mode ends unsuccessfully.\n\nKill the Witchking:\nThis mode requires combos to win.  The left ramp and right orbit will be lit.\nShooting either lights the right ramp for a combo for a few seconds. If the\nright ramp is hit within this time period, a hit is scored on the Witchking.\nIf not, the light times out and the first shots are re-lit.  Four combos total\nare required to kill him. \"First\" shots score 500K, right ramp combo shots\nscore 1M.  There is no limit to the number of \"first\" shots that can be\nscored, but no progress is made towards finishing the mode unless the\nfollowup right ramp shot is made.  30 seconds are given to complete this - if\ntime runs out, the mode ends unsuccessfully.\n\n\nCompleting a mode, successfully or unsuccessfully, will light its\ncorresponding lamp on the Ring solidly, and that mode cannot be played again.\nWhen all six modes are complete, all Ring lamps begin to slowly strobe.\nShooting Mode Start now will begin the final mode...\n\nThere and Back Again:\nTime to reminisce on all that has transpired on this long and grand adventure.\nOr, more precisely, the six modes we just completed. Once the ball is\nreturned to play, the Ring will be lit and the mode lamps begin to\ncycle quickly.  Shooting the Ring scores 1M and \"locks in\" the lit mode. All\nsix main shots (less the Ring) are now lit.  Shoot any lit shot to collect\nthe total points you had originally completed the mode with.  I.E. If you\nfinished Ents with 6.25M, you will score 6.25M from any lit shot when Ents\nare locked in. After scoring the mode total, the Ring relights for another\nmode, with the completed one now lit solidly and excluded from the cycle.\nAlso, the shot used to score that mode total is now cleared and unavailable for\nfuture modes during TaBA - only five shots will be lit for the next attempt.\nAs each shot is \"used up\", it becomes more difficult to score mode totals\nafter each Ring shot. Completing all six modes and shooting the Ring one last\ntime ends There and Back Again, awards 5M and lights a Gift of the Elves. A 60\nsecond timer runs, and seems not to stop when the ball is hung up in the Jets,\nso work quickly.\n\nSTACKING:\n\nAs was said above, all modes are exclusive - none can run with another.\nHowever, any mode can be stacked with Gollum MB or one of the movie\nmultiballs.  To stack with a movie multiball, the mode must be started\nbefore the multiball.  During the multiball, all of the red arrows will be\nused for the multiball jackpot shots, so the player MUST know what shots to\nhit for the mode, as there will be no playfield indications.  Timers also will\nnot be displayed, being trumped by multiball animations, however as the mode\ncomes to an end, the game will still yell out the countdown as appropriate.\nOnce a movie multiball has been started, no modes can be started until the\nMM is finished.  Stacking with Gollum is easier, as modes can be started\neven after Gollum is started, and Gollum doesn't pre-empt the shot displays.\n\n\n--------------------\n  MOVIE MULTIBALLS\n--------------------\n\nThere are three main multiballs in the game, each based upon one of the three\nstories: Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King. Each\none requires different steps to qualify, and each has its own rules. Progress\ntowards qualifying any multiball is completely independent of the other, and\nthey can be started in any order.  The three multiball inserts by the flippers\nshow the status of each.  Off = not qualified yet, blinking = qualified, ready\nto start, lit solidly = completed (successfully or not).  Finishing all three\nmultiballs (successfully or not) lights \"Destroy the Ring\" - the main goal\nof the game.  It is possible to play multiple instances of any movie multiball\nbefore starting Destroy the Ring, and indeed, it will usually take several\nattempts to complete each multiball's goal.  Progress made in any multiball\nis carried over to subsequent instances of that multiball.  However, it does\nbecome more difficult to qualify each successive multiball (see notes for each).\n\nAdd-A-Ball:\nDuring any movie multiball, lighting Palantir during the MB and then collecting\nit will usually give Add-A-Ball.  This puts one additional ball into play, up\nto four (if the player hasn't lost any).  This award is pseudo-random - you will\nUSUALLY get it within the first or second Palantir, but occasionally not.\nNo ballsaver comes with this extra ball, however, balls drained SDTM *right* as\nthe new ball is ejected will usually be returned to play as well.\n\n\nFellowship of the Ring:\n-----------------------\n\nQualifying:\n\nThis multiball is qualified by collecting each member of the Fellowship, then\nshooting Barad Dur to start. White Fellowship member lamps are arrayed across\nthe middle of the playfield.  Off means that member is not yet eligible to\nbe collected, flashing means they can be collected by shooting the appropriate\nshot (see playfield description), lit solid indicates they are already\ncollected.  At game start, all members are flashing, ready to be collected.\nFuture FotR multiballs have only some members flashing - only a couple are\neligible for collection at any one time.  Once all are collected, the whole\nline begins to strobe slowly and the left orbit is lit to start the multiball.\nNote that any ball that finds its way into Barad Dur will start the multiball,\nso a missed Ring shot that dribbles into the eject is just as good as a left\norbit shot.\n\nPlaying:\n\nThis is a two-part multiball, however, most games will have the Cave Troll\nsequence disabled, as that is the factory setting.  If the multiball starts\nwith \"This isn't a mine...  it's a tomb!   Orcs!!\", Cave Troll is enabled\nand you get both parts.  If it starts \"A Balrog...  This foe is beyond any of\nus...   RUN!\" then that machine has Cave Troll disabled and you don't get to\nsee any of that - skip ahead to \"Balrog\" below.\n\nCave Troll: Once balls are put into play, all shots will be lit for Jackpot\nand a ballsaver is active.  It takes 5 Jackpots to kill the Troll. On the\nfirst FotR MB of a game, these Jackpots are worth 00K (?), 250K, 500K, 750K\nand finally 2.5M (and one dead Troll). Later FotR multiballs have each Troll\njackpot worth 1M. Once the Troll is dead, Balrog mode begins.  A ballsaver\nruns throughout this initial Troll mode.  If the player drains too many balls\nor takes too long to kill the troll, the game advances to the Balrog sequence\nanyway, with no further Troll jackpots available.\n\n(Note: 8.0 ROMS may have fixed the \"00\" Jackpot bug)\n\nBalrog: Gandalf will announce the presence of the Balrog and suggest flight.\nThe glowing Balrog swings out to block the Ring ramp, and battle commences.\nThe player must first hit the Balrog (500K), then shoot either ramp to get\none member of the Fellowship across the bridge (750K). Repeat eight times\nto rescue all Fellowship members except Gandalf, who will always be the last.\nOn this ninth Balrog hit (YOU.. SHALL.. NOT.. PASS!!!), the Balrog is\ndestroyed and the multiball ends successfully. Victory laps are now available\n(see Victory Laps). Killing the Balrog is worth 5M and lights a Gift of the\nElves. Hits to the Balrog while it is unlit (ramps lit instead) are worth\n100K each.\n\n\nThe Two Towers\n--------------\n\nQualifying:\n\nThis multiball is qualified by spelling K-E-E-P with the bottom lanes to light\nSword Locks, then locking three balls on the Sword (right) Ramp. On the first\nmultiball, locks can be stacked (multiple K-E-E-Ps completed before locking a\nball).  Subsequent multiballs require each lock to be lit, then collected\nbefore the next lock can be lit.  Locks are not virtual - balls are actually\nkept on the sword. Locks ARE remembered, however, in case other multiballs\nempty the Sword.  No stealing other player's locks here.  Note that K-E-E-P\nletters can only be collected during normal play - any multiball or special\nmode \"locks\" the letters and prevents any more from being collected. If,\nduring regular play, you have all four letters lit, that means you must\nlock a ball before the next set can be collected.  On the first multiball, if\nall four stay lit, that means you already have all three locks qualified.\nLater TTT multiballs are harder to qualify, with KEEP letters eventually\ntoggling with every rollover.\n\nPlaying:\n\n\"A new power is rising...  TO WAR!!\"  Multiball begins with a base jackpot\nvalue, and two available multipliers.  First, the number of balls in play\ndetermines if it is a regular Jackpot (2 balls in play), Double Jackpot\n(three balls) or Triple Jackpot (4 balls, via Gollum MB stack or Add-A-Ball).\nNext, the jackpot is multiplied by its \"number\".  All shots begin lit for\nJackpot.  As each is collected, it goes out and the number is increased by one.\n\"Double Jackpot ONE!  Double Jackpot TWO!  Double Jackpot THREE!\" .. etc.\nAs long as the player keeps hitting Jackpots one after another, the number\nkeeps increasing, up to seven (the last lit Jackpot). If the player delays\nmore than three seconds between collecting Jackpots, the number resets back\nto one and all Jackpots relight.  The base value is first multiplied by 2 or 3,\ndepending on the number of balls in play, then by its number, so a \"Triple\nJackpot 5\", for example, is 15X.\n\nThe base value of the Jackpot depends on how far through th battle you've\nprogressed.  It starts at 100K, then increases to 112.5K during Ladders, then\n125K after the wall is breached, and finally 137.5K while falling back to\nthe keep.  Progress through the battle by scoring Jackpots. Doubled and Tripled\nJackpots advance faster - approximately 7 Triples, 14 Doubles or 21 Singles\nare required to progress to each new stage of the Battle of Helms Deep.\nAt the end of the last \"Fall Back\" stage, all Jackpots go out and the\ncenter Ring is lit for a Super Jackpot.  The value of the Super is determined\nby how many points are collected during the battle - I do not know the exact\nformula, but the better you do during the battle, the higher the Super. Average\nvalues are from 1.5M to 2.5M. Collecting the Super lights two more Supers\nat the inner orbit and Gollum Cave.  After collecting one of these two, the\nother is available for a few more seconds, at which point it is forfeited and\nthe next two Supers light, one on each ramp.  Same rule - after collecting one,\nyou have about 5 seconds to get the other before it times out.  Finally,\nthe two orbits are lit for Supers.  Same rule, get one then the other before it\ntimes out. Victory Laps are now available (see Victory Laps) and the battle\nis effectively over.\n\nScoring the first Super Jackpot finishes the multiball successfully and\nlights one Gift of the Elves.\n\nNote: TTT has arguably the highest available Jackpot multiplier in all of\npinball: 84X.  This is achieved by scoring a triple (3) jackpot seven (7)\nduring the Smeagol phase of Gollum Multiball (2) and also while the 2X\nPlayfield Elf gift is running (2).  3x7 = 21 x2 = 42 x2 = 84.  Good luck\ngetting this!\n\nThe Return of the King\n----------------------\n\nQualifying:\n\nThis multiball is qualified by collecting 5000 Souls from the Paths of the\nDead.  Any time the ball falls into the Orthanc VUK during regular play (not\nduring a multiball or special mode), it is kicked up onto the Paths of the\nDead for soul collection.  Four green lights are lit on the backboard, each\ncorresponding to one of the four switches on the Paths.  These lights will\neither be off, lit or flashing.  Off = 100 souls, lit = 250 and flashing is\nworth 500.  As of v5.00, if the ball falls into the Shire, the player is\nawarded 300 souls plus 50 more each trip to the Paths.  Balls falling onto\nthe wireform earn no extra Souls.  Once 5000 souls are collected, Orthanc,\nBarad Dur and Gollum's Cave are qualified to start RotK MB.\n\nThe green lights on the Paths of the Dead are controlled two ways:  Any white\nplayfield target will advance one light one step (i.e. off to lit, lit to\nflashing), up to a maximum of four flashing lights.  These targets are:\nthe target in the back of the Shire, the target in the back of the right\nramp, Palantir and Spot Ring.  They add lights regardless whether they are\nlit for their normal awards.  Also, the jet bumpers re-arrange the order of\nthe lamps (obviously no effect if they're all lit the same).\n\nPlaying:\n\nThis multiball is divided into stages, with four Jackpots per stage. The four\nRing shots are always used for the four Jackpots - left ramp, inner orbit,\nright ramp and right orbit.  Each will be lit with one to four lamps (the red\narrow plus one to three of the Ring inserts). Single lamp shots are regular\nJackpots, two lamps are Double Jackpots, three lamps means Triple Jackpot and\nfour lamps score a 4X Jackpot. Base Jackpot value is 250K, plus 50K for each\nlevel completed - scoring all four Jackpots advances one level. Also, and very\nimportant, collecting Jackpots IN ORDER will increase the base multiplier by\none for the next level.  I.E. If you collect the Jackpot, Double, Triple and\n4X in that order on the first level, the second level will have 2x, 3x, 4x and\n5x multipliers for the four Jackpots.  Collect those in order (lowest to\nhighest) and level three will have 3x, 4x, 5x and 6x.  Messing up one level\ndoesn't prevent increasing multipliers on later levels - you just don't get\nany advancement for *that* level.\n\nThere are seven levels total.  After getting the last Jackpot of the seventh\nlevel, all four shots relight for Super Jackpots - 1M each multiplied by\nwhatever you've managed to push the multipliers up to by then.  After\ncollecting these four Supers, Victory Laps are enabled (see Victory Laps).\nClearing Level 7 also lights one Gift of the Elves.\n\n\n----------------\n  Victory Laps\n----------------\n\nUpon completing any movie multiball, Victory Laps are enabled.  All 7 main\nshots are lit for laps.  First is worth 500K, next is 550K, next is 600K,\netc.  As each shot is collected, it goes out - shooting the center Ring will\nrelight all shots and the value resets back to the base value (500K). If you\ncan collect all seven Laps before shooting the Ring to relight them, the base\nvalue is increased 50K for all subsequent sets of Laps - first is 550K, second\nis 600K, etc. This continues until the player drains back to one ball.\n\n\n--------------------\n  Gollum Multiball\n--------------------\n\nGollum Multiball is qualified by collecting nine Rings of Man (see Rings).\nShoot Gollum's Cave when it is lit to begin Gollum MB.  Gollum cannot be\nstarted during any Movie Multiball, nor can it be during special modes\nsuch as Ring Multiball or Destroy the Ring.  It CAN be started during any\nregular mode.  Gollum is a NON-exclusive multiball - anything that was running\nbefore you started it will continue to run, modes and movie multiballs can be\nstarted, souls collected, etc.  Gollum Multiball simply does two things:\n\n1. Adds a ball into play.  During regular play, you now have two balls with\nwhich you can score things.  Very handy for clearing some modes.  If a\nmovie multiball is started, you get four balls instead of three - also very\nhandy!\n\n2. Alters ALL scoring based on the following pattern: Every seven seconds,\nGollum changes to Smeagol, and vice versa.  If Gollum is up, all scores are\nHALVED(!).  If Smeagol is up, all scores are DOUBLED.  This is on top of\nany other multiplier or modifier that could be applied to the scoring in\nquestion, and affects ALL scoring, regardless of source (except Bonus, of\ncourse).\n\nMathematically, Gollum MB is good overall, as the player will get scores\nof 1.25x normal on average.  Skillful play (timing things so big scores are\nachieved during Smeagol phases) can significantly increase scoring.\n\nNote that on current software (5.01), Gollum MB cannot be achieved if RotK\nMB is qualified, as Gollum's Cave starts RotK instead of Gollum MB.  If you\nwant to stack these, start Gollum BEFORE qualifying RotK.\n\nNote that this condition is fixed in version 8.0 - Gollum's VUK starts\nGollum instead of TTT multiball.\n\nResurrecting movie multiballs:  If you just drained back to one ball after\na movie multiball, and Gollum MB is lit, you can \"resurrect\" that movie\nmultiball by starting Gollum MB *before* the final musical fanfare signifying\nthe end of the movie MB is played (this fanfare is accompanied by a screen\nshowing your total points for the multiball).  There is about a 5 second\ngrace period between the end of the multiball music and displays, and the\nactual \"end\" of the multiball, during which Gollum will \"resurrect\" the movie\nMB with two ball play.\n\n\n\n------------------------\n  Gollum's Cave Awards\n------------------------\n\nShots to Gollum's Cave are counted, and \"Super\" awards are given at specified\nintervals.  \"Super\" awards increase scoring on a particular game feature. They\nare, in order of being awarded:\n\nSuper Spinner: each spin is worth 15K\nSuper Pops: each jet hit is worth 20K\nSuper Ramps: each ramp is worth 250K\nSuper Loops: each loop is worth 250K\nSuper Everything: each switch is worth 10K\n\nAfter going through the cycle, the number of cave shots required for each\naward is increased by one, and the cycle begins again (on the next ball).\nInitially, every three shots gives a Super award... after one cycle, four\nshots are needed for each, etc.  \"Super\" points are always scored, regardless\nof what modes are running.\n\n\n--------------------\n  Barad Dur awards\n--------------------\n\nShooting Barad Dur (either via the left orbit, or by a ball bouncing in from\na missed Ring shot) will increment the Tower Hit count by one, and awards are\ngiven out at certain intervals - 3rd hit, 7th, 12th and every 5th from there\nonward.  Hold Ring Bonus is the first award per ball, with future awards\nusually being 2M each.  Light Extra Ball is always awarded at a certain\ninterval (operator adjustable, usually the seventh hit).\n\nShooting Barad Dur also re-lights Palantir if it is unlit.\n\n\n------------\n  Palantir\n------------\n\nWhen lit, the white Palantir target will give helpful awards when it is shot.\nThese awards are pseudo-random, but the game does a good job of giving out\nawards that are particularly helpful for the current game situation. Example:\n\"Add-A-Ball\" during a multiball, \"Add 10 Seconds\" if a mode is in danger of\ntiming out, \"10 Second Ball Saver\" during Destroy the Ring, etc.\n\nSome examples of Palantir Awards:\n\nSpot Fellowship member\nSpot Keep Letter\nSpot one Ring  (dwarf/elf/man)\nSpot 500 Souls\nAdd-A-Ball\n10 second Ball-Saver\nAdd 30 Seconds (to 2x Scoring)\nAdd 100K to Bonus\nAdd 3 Bonus Multipliers\n\n\n----------------------\n  Gifts of the Elves\n----------------------\n\nGifts of the Elves are valuable awards that the player gets when any mode or\nmultiball is completed successfully. They are lit at the left orbit and\ncollected at Barad Dur.  Multiple Gifts can be queued up, but only one can\nbe collected at any time.  The six orange inserts near the left orbit\nindicate which Gift is ready to be collected (blinking), which ones have\nalready been collected (lit solid) and which remain to be collected (off).\nYou can change the flashing Gift by hitting the white target in the back of\nThe Shire.\n\nThe gifts are as follows:\n\n\nLight Extra Ball:  Does exactly what it says - lights Extra Ball at Gollum's\ncave.  On factory settings, this lit EB is remembered if you drain the current\nball in play.\n\nRing Multiball: Begins Ring Multiball.  This is a special, exclusive multiball\nmode with one simple goal: shoot the center Ring repeatedly.  This shot awards\na 600K jackpot, increasing 50K for each successive shot (to a max of 1M).\nPalantir can award Add-A-Ball during this multiball, and it can be stacked on\na mode as long as the mode is started before collecting the Gift.\n\nLight Special: Again, does exactly that: lights Special at Gollum's Cave. This\nis remembered under factory settings.\n\nBig Points: Awards 5M points instantly...\n\n2X Scoring:  Doubles ALL scoring for 60 seconds.  This is on top of ALL other\nmultipliers that may be in effect (Gollum, TTT multipliers, RotK multipliers,\netc. etc.)  Nothing is excluded.  Collecting Palantir during this mode will\noftentimes add 30 seconds to the double-scoring timer.\n\nSuper Ring Frenzy: Starts Ring Frenzy, which operates exactly like a regular\nRing Frenzy, except the scoring is higher:  each shot now earns 225K, 250K\nand 275K, and the base Jackpot start at 1M. Timers and multipliers behave\nthe same as a regular Frenzy.\n\n\nI have heard rumors of a Super Ring Frenzy Multiball that can be awarded when\nall the other Gifts are completed...\n\n\n-----------\n  Mystery\n-----------\n\nMystery is lit at The Shire by collecting seven Dwarf rings.  Getting the ball\ninto the Shire via the playfield (not the Paths of the Dead) will collect the\nmystery award and reset the Dwarf Rings. Mystery awards can be pretty\nlucrative - be sure to collect them whenever you can.  Note, however, that\nMystery will often start movie multiballs that are close to being qualified, so\nif that is something you do NOT want to happen, avoid this shot until you're\nready.\n\nExamples of Mystery Awards:\n\nStart Fellowship (multiball)\nStart Two Towers (multiball)\nStart Return of the King (multiball)\nSpot 1000 Souls\nMax Paths of the Dead (all lamps 500 souls)\nAdd 100K to Bonus\nMedium Points (1M)\nLight Extra Ball\nAd 5X Bonus\n\n\n--------------------\n  Destroy the Ring\n--------------------\n\nOnce all three movie multiballs have been played, the center Ring shot is\nqualified for Destroy the Ring (no modes can be started until this is\ncollected).  This is a three-stage mode.  First, the ball will be returned\nto play, and the four Ring shots (left ramp, inner orbit, right ramp, right\norbit) are all lit.  Each must be collected, to the tune of 1M, 1.5M, 2M and\n2.5M.  Now, the Ring re-lights.  Shoot it for 3M, and it will grab the ball\nand hold it while the game autoplunges a new ball.  For the final stage, you\nmust knock the captured ball out of the Ring.  Doing this will destroy the\nRing (and poor Gollum), scoring 5M points, and cause the machine to go nuts\nin celebration as both balls drain (you get your ball back).  Destroying the\nRing also lights one Gift of the Elves, and (as of ver 5.01), displays a\nhint towards achieving Valinor Multiball.  Once finished, a ball is served\nto the plunger and the movie multiballs that were solidly lit go out.\n\nIf you drain during any stage of Destroy the Ring, the mode ends and you get\nnothing except any points you may have already scored in it.  Bummer.\n\nMalfunctions:  It is possible to win Destroy the Ring early, if the shot to\nthe Ring after the initial four shots is strong enough to go THROUGH the ring\nwithout being grabbed - this immediately ends the mode successfully.  It is\nalso possible to get both balls stuck in the Ring - if this happens, a\nballsearch will drop both, and if either drains, you lose the mode. Not\ngood.  Usually, things work as intended.\n\nUPDATE:  Later ROM revisions (8.0) provide the operator with the ability\nto set DTR to a one-ball affair.  If the game is set to this, the Ring does\nnot hold the ball, but will release it..  the player simply needs to shoot\nthe Ring again to win.  This was added to overcome difficulties players were\nexperiencing on some location machines in dislodging the first ball from\nthe Ring.  If the game's flippers are weak, do hope that this is enabled :)\n\n\n---------------------\n  Valinor Multiball\n---------------------\n\nThe following is a post by The_Black_Knight to rec.games.pinball on\nMarch 21, 2004:\n\n\nTo all,\n\nI finally achieved Valinor after almost two months of work (off and\non)...\n\nRequirements:\n1)  Complete FOTR MB (All eight members+Gandalf Balrog Strike),\nachieve Super Jackpots for an Elf Gift at minimum\n2)  Complete TTT MB (Survive the Assault to the end, new level every 5\njackpots achieved), achieve Super Jackpots for an Elf Gift at minimum\n3)  Complete ROTK MB (All Seven Levels), achieve Super Jackpots for an\nElf Gift at minimum\n4) Play all 6 Rings Modes (Completion not required)\n5) Play There and Back Again (Completion not required)\n6) Collect all six Elf Gifts (not sure if this a requirement, but I\ndid, with modes and MB Gifts)  (ed: yes this is a requirement)\n7) Destroy the Ring (2X Required, or ONCE if you are SUPER SUPER HOT!)\n\nBased on what I have seen, Valinor is near impossible to achieve\nwithout playing each of the Movie MBs at least twice, because you have\nto completed all the above requirements, and destroy the ring, before\nValinor will start immediately following.  I did not complete FOTR\nRing MB, the first time, before Destroying the Ring, so I cannot\nconfirm.\n\n\nSTRATEGY TO VALINOR.......\n\nMy best strategy is to start working the TTT MB first, in conjunction\nwith Ring Modes, getting at least three rings modes in the first ball,\nbut not lighting the final lock on TTT MB if at all possible (left and\nright ramps), to keep the ring modes open to collect.\n\nI work the \"War of the Ents\" to maximize the trips to Path of Dead for\nsouls toward the ROTK MB. I do this by \"setting up\" the ring mode\nselection, but adjusting the top lights to one light to left of War of\nthe Ents, and shooting the Ring from the right flipper.  Another way\nto maximize souls, is to use the sword ramp drop, in conjunction with\nthe right flipper shot directing around the left orbit.\n\nBy this time all three MBs are generally lit (with all those different\nshots), and TTT MB is most likely already completed, and being lit for\na second time.  I start another ring mode and I exploit TTT MB for\npoints, extra balls, and completion of the ring mode (Attack of Shelob\nis a good TTT MB choice).\n\nI try to hold off Gollum MB if at all possible, until \"Destroy the\nRing\" is lit.  Then I start Gollum MB.  When this occurs the Ring shot\nreverts back to allowing Ring Modes to be completed.  I continue to\nwork Ring Modes in conjunction with Gollum, and play out FOTR MB, with\nfour immediate balls to get the Cave Troll Award and maximize chances\nfor completing FOTR MB.\n\nIf you are not able to complete all the Ring Modes and There and Back\nAgain, prior to Destroying the Ring, you will have to do it all again\n(all the Movie MBs).......to get back to the chance to start Valinor.\n\nThe basic key is to use Ring Modes in conjunction with MB, to maximize\nthe effect.  This way seem like common sense, but its tricky to\ncomplete the Ring Modes without finishing all the MBs first, and\nending up already getting to the Destroy the Ring, which nullifies the\nability to get There and Back Again, without a Gollum MB.  That is\nwhy, is so important to get at least three Ring Modes on the first\nball of a 3-Ball game.\n\nGood game for the ages.  Still do not know if it will be with me in\ntwo years.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nThe_Black_Knight\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Lord of the Rings", "manufacturer": "Stern Pinball, Inc", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/lordoftherings.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

I had a chance for a few games before it left but I refused to play it on site at Rio's nightclub. Due to a request for a rulesheet on Scott Piehler's site I traced it to a more agreeable location and the following is the end result. The ROM version used was version A1.02.\n\nPlayfield layout\n\nClockwise from the drain:\nInlanes/Outlanes: Normal. Outlanes can light for Special. Left inlane lights super pops. Right inlane lights Mystery for a few seconds.\nGreen targets: 3 green standups. Hitting these counts towards Condition red multiball.\nLeft orbit: Standard orbit shot. Spots R in Robot.\nRamp: Each ramp counts towards a planet. The number of ramps needed is shown on the display along with the points for the next planet. Also awards jackpots in condition red multiball and extra balls. Balls return to the left flipper.\nMystery scoop: Lit by a spinner lane shot or the right inlane. Spots O in robot.\nRed targets: 3 red targets. Counts towards Condition Red multiball.\nBumpers: 5 located behind the mystery scoop. Awards 10k per hit which rollover lanes and a lit spinner lane increase. Balls exit either through a small opening or through the Mystery scoop.\nRollover Lanes: 3 lanes above the bumpers. Unlike normal games, these don\u2019t advance the bonus X. their sole purpose is to count down to Fighter multiball.\nMagnets: 2 magnets in the orbit. 1 above the bumper lanes, the other above the top vuk.\nSpinner lane: Narrow lane leading into the bumpers. Lights Mystery when lit and can be lit for Super pops. Spots B in Robot.\nRobot: Hard to hit lane with a model robot above it. Spots O in Robot and starts Robot multiball when lit. balls return to the right flipper.\nVUK: A vuk located behind the robot. The magnet above it is supposed to catch balls and feed them here at the start of condition red. Balls landing here are kicked out to a spinning disk like the one on Twister.\nRight orbit: Same as the left. Spots T in Robot and starts Condition Red multiball when lit.\nYellow targets: 3 yellow targets. Counts towards Condition Red multiball.\nWarning letters: 7 lights across the center of the playfield spelling Warning. Used in Robot multiball.\n\nGame play\nLost in Space is very much a multiball game. There are no modes at all. Like on Twister there are three different multiballs.\n\nRobot Multiball\nTo start Robot multiball, you have to shoot the 5 shots with a robot letter to spell Robot. This lights multiball at the robot shot. Shoot the robot to start. This is a 4-ball multiball in which the object is to spell Warning. Each lit Robot shot adds a letter to warning and scores 5 M. completing Warning lights the Robot for unlimited super jackpots of 20M. Warning letters carry over between players and games. Ends when 1 ball remains.\n\nFighter Multiball\nTo start Fighter multiball you need to go through the rollover lanes a set number of times. This starts at 5 and increases by 5 for each subsequent multiball. Each lane increases the value of 1 bumper by 10k. if the spinner lane is lit for super pops, shooting this lane counts as a lane hit. When the required number of rollovers is reached Fighter multiball starts. This is a 4-ball multiball and the object is to shoot the balls back into the bumpers. Each shot to the orbits or the spinner lane awards a jackpot. The jackpot values start at 3M and are increased by bumper hits. When a jackpot is scored the value resets to 3M. ends when 1 ball remains in play.\n\nCondition Red Multiball\nTo start Condition Red multiball you need to hit the 3 green, yellow and red targets as in High Speed. 3 hits to the green targets scores 5M and lights the yellow targets. 3 hits on the red targets lights the right orbit to start multiball. The balls are trapped by a magnet and fed to the spinning disk just like the start of canister multiball on Twister. The ramp is lit for jackpots starting at 5M. lighting all 9 color targets increases the jackpot value by 10M. ends when 1 ball remains.\n\n3 in 1\nPlaying all 3 multiballs in a single ball awards a 25M bonus at the end of the ball and an ego award in the high score table.\n\n\nOther Scoring\nThe mystery scoop advances the spinner value by 10k if mystery is not lit.\n5 ramps scores 10M\n10 ramps scores 15M\n17 ramps scores 20M\nEnd of ball bonus:\n1M+100k per target+100k per ramp+100k per robot+25M 3in 1 bonus * bonus X\n\nMystery Awards\n\n\n+ bonus X\nEB lit\n3M\n5M\n10M\nCondition Red multiball (on ball 3 if unplayed)\nRobot multiball\nFighter multiball\n+1 bumper\n+1 Warning letter\nSpecial lit\nHurry up. 10M countdown. Shoot robot to collect.\n\nDraining via the outlanes on the last ball scores the Dr Smith bonus. 1M and a very apt quote \"Oh the pain\".\n\nBang Backs and Death Saves\nForget about death saves. The nice folk at SEGA have placed a center post in the way. On the machine that I played bang backs were very easy to do, but this would be machine dependent.\n\nBragging\nNot a lot to brag about. 162M. It should be noted however that the right orbit on this machine didn't work very well.\nIf you have anything to add please e-mail me via chrisb@enternet.com.au and I will include it in future updates.\nWell that's it. I kinda like this game as it makes a nice change from games where you have to complete 100 modes to get anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Lost in Space", "possible_shots": "Inlanes/Outlanes, Green targets, Left orbit, Ramp, Mystery scoop, Red targets, Bumpers, Rollover Lanes, Magnets, Spinner lane, Robot, VUK, Right orbit, Yellow targets, Warning letters", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/lostinspace.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Lost in Space", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Feeds left inlane.\n\nT standup\nLocated at the right of the ramp entrance, one of the letters for SITEB.\nSee \"Site B\" for more.\nJet bumpers\nThree bumpers located in the standard triangular pattern.\nThere is a lane just to the right of the T target where the ball can be\nshot into, or fall out of.\n\nMore time standup\nLocated just to the left of the jet bumper lane. Increases bumper value\nwhen unlit, adds time to modes when lit. See \"More Time\" for more.\nCan be hit directly from the right flipper or from a lucky hit off the\nbumpers. \n\nJ and P rollovers\nLocated directly above the bumpers. Advances bonus multipliers (6X max)\nExtra ball lit at 6X.\n\nEgg Scoop\nTo the right of the bumper lane facing slightly to the left. A giant\nbaby T-Rex egg sits on top and opens to reveal a baby T-Rex at appropriate\ntimes. Various awards are collect here as well as Baby TREX. See \"Egg\nScoop\" and \"Baby TREX\" for more. Kickout should hit the left flipper\nmuch like the scoop on Attack from Mars.\n\nE standup\nLocated to the right of the scoop, one of the letters for SITEB.\nShots to the scoop sometimes will hit this.\nSee \"Site B\" for more.\n\nRight ramp\nJust to the right of the Egg, a steep ramp which loops back on itself\nand feed the right inlane. Can be hit easily from a trapped ball on the\nleft flipper or by a luck backhand from the right. Spots letters for\nGPS. See \"GPS\" for more. Jackpots are collected here during regular\nmultiball.\nB standup\nJust to the right of the right ramp entrance, one of the letters for\nSITEB. See \"Site B\" for more.\nRight loop/spinner\nLights up World, you only have to trigger the spinner for it to count.\nCompleting left and right loops lights the egg for a random award. See\n\"The Egg Scoop\" for more. One of the three locks is collected here.\nCollects jackpots during multiball. See \"Multiball\" for more. Repeated\nloops score Jurassic Loop. See \"Misc. Extras\" for more. Weak shots drop\ninto the bumpers. The spinner is the main shot in Mobile Lab. See\n\"Mobile Lab\" for more.\n\nTOR targets\nLocated almost directly across from the RAP targets and function\nidentically, except for the spotting of different letters, of course.\nSlingshots rotate which targets in RAPTOR are lit.\n\nRight inlane/outlane\nPlenty of rubber here as well.\nLights E or X in TREX.\n\nAutoplunger\nA normal button that says launch on it. Launched balls usually travel\nup and hit the drop target, occasionally they miss and either hit the\nI target or bump around in the center loop. See \"Skill Shot\" for more.\nThis button is used to fire the Smart Missile.\n\n\nBall Saver\nAt the start of each ball, there is a brief (approx 5 sec.) ball\nsaver. This is the usual SEGA ball saver which is VERY strict; if the\nlight is out, the saver is not on.\n\nIf the ball hits the outlane switch, the saver is extended slightly so\nthe ball will hopefully make it to the outhole while the saver is still\non.\n\nSkill Shot\nAt the start of a ball there is a video-like skill shot. The goal\nis to make the Dino foot step on the humans. A successful skill shot\nis worth 200k, a missed skill shot is worth 50k.\n\nOccasionally you get a Super Skill shot; Instead of people, there\nare strange objects to step on: Shark fins(?), a grandma, ET (!),\nas well as others. A successful Super Skill Shot is worth the same\nas a normal skill shot.\n\nIn tournament mode, skill shot is disabled and awards 50K, regardless\nof what the display says.\n\nThe Egg Scoop\nThe Egg scoop is lit at the start of the game and on your first ball\nI'm 99% sure that it will always award the Smart Missile. The scoop can\nbe relit by hitting both spinners.\n\nAwards include:\n\n Smart Missile (one per game)\n Light Lock\n Award Lock\n Light Extra Ball\n Extra Ball\n Special\n 100,000\n 200,000\n 300,000\n Video Mode\n Increase Multiplier\n Hold Bonus\n\n\nAny others?\n\nVideo Mode\nA very quick video mode, not even really connected to the game. There\nare two ropes and a small pitfall-like guy who is suppose to swing\nfrom rope to rope and then over a T-Rex who is trying to eat you.\n\nA completed video mode awards 350K, a failed video mode awards 100K.\nA failed video mode that you manage to make to the first rope awards\n150K.\n\nVideo mode is always the same and isn't too hard to complete. Just wait\nfor the right spot to swing at, hit launch, and the guy just goes.\nOccasionally, you can swing into the T-Rex's mouth, but you don't get\nanything extra for doing it.\nMultiball\nMultiball is first started by hitting the drop target 4 times to\nlight all three locks. If you don't finish the drop target on your\nfirst ball, one lock will light for you each ball, until you complete\nthe drop target or light all three locks. You then have to lock three\nballs, left loop, right loop, and middle loop. All locks are virtual,\nno balls are held by the machine. When you have three balls locked,\nmultiball starts, a four ball multiball with three stages, and a brief\nballsaver:\n\n\n Both ramps must be hit for jackpots which unlight when collected.\nEach ramp jackpot is worth 500k.\n\n When both ramp jackpots have been collected, both loops light for\njackpots, which unlight when collected. Loop jackpots are worth\n750K. You must hit the loop switch to collect these.\n\n When both loop jackpots have been collected, the middle loop lights\nfor super jackpot. The super jackpot is worth a varying value which\nis displayed on the DMD. The animation for the super jackpot is\nalmost exactly like the DMD animation from Raptor Rampage from the\nfirst Jurassic Park. The animation is that of a raptor pointing at\ndifferent values from 1M to 4M. The values are arranged somewhat like\nthis:\n\n 1 1 2 2 3 4 3 2 2 1 1 \n\nA shot to the middle loop awards the pointed at value and starts the\nmultiball back at stage one.\n\n\nAs in most SEGA games, multiball is very valuable, especially if you can\nconsistently get to the super jackpot and collect it. Just reaching the\nthird stage of multiball nets you 500K + 500K + 750K + 750K = 2.5M;\nin this game, that isn't too bad.\n\nIf you happen to start multiball, drain all but one ball, and collect\nno jackpots, multiball restart is lit at all the loops and the drop\ntarget.\n\nOn subsequent multiballs, you must hit the drop target 4 times to light\neach lock. Only two locks will be spotted if you don't completed the\ndrop target.\n\nSmart Missile\nUnlike Jurassic Park, the Smart Missile must be collected. It's almost\nalways the first award from the Egg Scoop. There are also a few differences\nfrom Jurassic Park's Smart Missile:\n\n\n Lost World's Smart Missile only pertains to Multiball\n\n If the locks aren't lit, it will light all locks (1st Multiball)\n If all the locks are lit, multiball starts (handy while draining)\n It will collect any lit jackpots during multiball.\n If you are trying to collect the super jackpot with the smart missile,\nthe raptor will sometimes skip over the 4M shot.\n\n\n Jurassic Park's Smart Missile hit EVERYTHING, all switches, and it collected\nthe points for everything as well.\n\n\nLike Jurassic Park, the Smart Missile is deactivated when the outlane is hit.\n\nMore Time\nEach of the timed modes have the ability to have the timer increased.\nWhen the timer on a modes drops below 10sec, the More Time standup is\nlit. If the standup is hit, 10sec. is added to the mode.\n\nYou can only hit the More Time button once per mode.\nAdding time to modes like SITE B and Baby T-Rex can be well worth it.\n\nSITE B\nTo start SITE B you must first spell SITE B (the first time) and then\nhit one of the SITEB standups. SITE B targets are cycled by the bumpers\nand the slingshots.\n\nDuring SITE B your task is to hit the flashing target that is lit, but\nthere is a catch: there is only one flashing target lit and it moves\nwhen you hit a flipper. The left flipper moves the target to the left and\nright moves it to the right. You must hit at least three targets to complete\nthe mode.\n\nThe value starts at 200k and goes up by 100k until time is up. You have\n30 seconds to hit three targets but the mode doesn't end once you have\nhit the three targets, you get to play out the mode until time is up.\nThere doesn't seem to be an upper limit to the value as I have collected\n1.1M from hitting one target.\n\nSITE B is at first very frustrating but once some ball control is\nachieved, this mode is very valuable, just completing the three required\ntargets nets you 2M (200K + 300K + 400K + 100K for starting SITEB and 1M\ncompletion bonus) with each target after that building higher and\nhigher. It seems the safest and easiest shot is to backhand the E target\n\nTo light subsequent SITE B's you must spell SITE B one more time than\nthe previous SITE B.\n\nGPS\nGPS is started by hitting both ramps three times (for the first GPS)\nand then shooting either ramp when they are flashing.\n\nThe goal of GPS is to hit 4 ramps, each shot is worth 300k. The value\ncan be raised by alternating ramps, ie, left ramp, right ramp, left ramp\nthen the value is raised by 100k up to no known limit. The timer seems\nto be pretty short, less than 30sec.\n\nThe easiest way to finish GPS is by looping the left ramp which is\npretty easy to backhand. If you want to go all out for points, try\nto keep alternating the ramps; while not really hard, lighting GPS\nthe second time isn't as easy.\n\nTo light subsequent GPS', ramps must be alternated to light each letter.\nYou must also complete GPS one more time than the previous GPS. The number\nof shots to complete the next GPS goes up if you complete the mode or\nnot, slowly making GPS impossible to complete.\n\nBaby TREX\nBaby TREX lights when three shots to the egg scoop are made. Shoot the\nscoop to start.\n\nA fast countdown from 200k starts immediately when you hit the scoop. Hit\nthe scoop to collect the value. If you don't hit the scoop by the time\nthe countdown reaches 40k, you have about 5sec. to make the shot.\n\nOnce the countdown value is collected, you have 30sec. to shoot the egg\nthree more times to complete the mode. When you do make the three shots,\nthe mode does not end; additional shots to the scoop can be made.\n\nThis mode can be very valuable if you can lock in a value close to 200k.\nIf you do indeed lock in a high value, making repeated shots to the\nscoop is definitely worth it.\nTo light subsequent Baby T-Rex's, one more shot is needed than the\nprevious. The shots required to finish the mode stay the same.\n\nMobile Lab\nCompleting TREX on the inlane/outlanes lights the last completed letter's\noutlane/inlane light one of the letters for TREX. When the flashing\nletter is collected, Mobile Lab begins.\n\nMobile lab starts as a two-ball multiball where the goal is to shoot the\nspinners. Twenty spins are needed to collect the first mobile lab\njackpot. When a jackpot is collected, a ball is added, up to four balls.\n\n\n The first jackpot is collected at 20 spins and awards 200k.\n The second jackpot is collected at 25 spins and awards 300k.\n The third jackpot is collected at 40 spins and awards 400k.\n The fourth jackpot is collected at 50 spins and awards 500k.\n\n\nAfter a jackpot is collected, the number of spins collected resets.\nThere is a brief ballsaver at the beginning of this mode.\n\nMobile Lab ends when there are less than two balls in play.\n\nThis mode is HARD. The spinners on the machines I've played don't spin\nas well as they could and it's not exactly easy to get 120 spins if you\nhave four balls floating around. It's not too valuable, but you have to\nfinish it to light San Diego. :(\n\nTo light subsequent Mobile Lab's, you must complete TREX one more time\nthan the previous. The number of spins/jackpots remains the same.\n\nRaptor\nCompleting the RAPTOR targets lights both sets of targets flash for\nRAPTOR. Hitting either bank starts Raptor multiball.\n\nRaptor is a two-ball multiball. Jackpots are lit by hitting either\nthe RAP or TOR targets and then by shooting the middle loop. You have\nabout 15sec to hit the jackpot before having to relight it again.\nThe first jackpot is lit at the start of the mode.\n\nTo complete Raptor, you must make 2 jackpots. Jackpots start at 200k and\ngo up by 50k for each jackpot collected.\n\nRaptor ends when there are less than two balls in play.\n\nTo light subsequent Raptor's, you must spell RAPTOR one more time than\nthe previous. The number of jackpots needed does not change.\n\nMisc. Extras\nExtra balls can be lit at five middle loops, 6X bonus, or a random award.\n\nThe next shot after immediately after lighting the extra ball and every 5 middle\nloops after awards 300k.\n\nRepeated loop shots award Jurassic Loops. For each loop shot you can make\nin a row, the value increases by 50k. Jurassic loops can only be collected\nwhen modes aren't running and start at 50k.\n\nEvery 25 hits on the bumpers award a Pop Award of 25k.\nSpecial Thanks\nThanks to Bowen Kerins for filling in some of the holes and\nproof-reading :)\n\nThanks to Josh Lehan's Lost World rulesheet for providing me with some\ninfo that I may have forgotten without it.\n\nSan Diego\t<SPOILER ALERT>\nSan Diego is lit at the T-Rex scoop; it is a four-ball multiball where ANY\nmajor shot scores an increasing value, and ANY target increases the value.\nIt's a lot like Final Jam, except all major shots collect the Jackpot.  Cool\nanimations of the T-rex eating lots of folks.\n\n-=Jef Lepine=-\nMaintainer of the CT/MA/NH/RI Area Pindex:\nA list of pinball machines in this area.\nhttp://www.jlepine.tiac.net/pin.htm\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Lost World", "possible_shots": "Site B, Raptor Two-ball, Mobile Lab, Baby T-Rex, GPS", "manufacturer": "Data East (now SEGA)", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/lostworld.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Lost World", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Lost World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Lost World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom krellan@netgate.net Tue Jun 24 07:57:30 1997\n\n\nAn arcade around here (Playland) got a Lost World game!  My\nimpressions:\n\nIt's *hard*.  The outlanes aren't the world's friendliest, and there\nare at least two traps which send the ball SDTM: the \"S\" standup in\nSITEB, and the left exit from the jet bumpers.\n\nThe egg toy is OK, I wish the shell opened more.  It barely opens\nenough to see the dino inside it, once it's fully open.  And, I see TJ\nhas found another place to put a Martian in!  I can see this becoming\nthe next pinball in-joke...\n\nI have mixed feelings about the \"Snatcher\" toy.  It is fun to watch\nthe first few times, then it gets dull, as it holds the ball out of\nplay for a long time as it moves (like the Crane on LAH).\n\nThe \"Snatcher\" runs on thin plastic pulleys and chains?  I think I\nonce put together something more sturdy with Legos when I was a kid!\nI estimate three days until it breaks.  When I was playing, the people\naround me estimated anywhere from one day until a week, let's see\nwho's right...\n\nI didn't get very far into the game.  There are five \"modes\" to play,\nand completing them all gets you to San Diego (the wizard mode).  In\nmy best game of the night, I was only able to complete two of the\nfive.  (In not one game did I get a replay!)\n\nThey are not your typical \"modes\".  There is no Mode Start target!  To\nstart each \"mode\", you complete the targets in a certain area of the\nplayfield.  They are:\n\nSite B: Spell SITEB (standup targets on various posts throughout the\nplayfield, like the Greed targets in TZ)\nMobile Lab: Spell TREX (inlanes and outlanes, lane-changeable, like\nlighting Stroke of Luck in AFM)\nRaptor: Spell RAPTOR (RAP and TOR banks of standup targets, placed\nalmost identically to the ROCK standups on GnR)\nGPS: Hit the left ramp three times, and the right ramp three times\nEgg: Hit the Egg scoop several times\n\n\nWhen you complete one of the above requirements, one of the targets of\nthat requirement will start to flash.  (e.g. if you're starting Raptor\nmode, one of the RAPTOR standups will start flashing)  Hit that target\nto start the mode.  Now, you get *Multiball* to play the mode with!\nYou have to do something during Multiball, usually involving the\ntargets of that mode, in order to complete that mode.\n\nIf you don't succeed during Multiball, you do *NOT* get credit for\nthat mode, and must start it again!  I believe all five modes have\nMultiball and work this way, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is in addition to the main \"Lock 1, Lock 2, Lock 3\" Multiball of\nthe game (that uses the Snatcher).  So, assuming San Diego is a\nMultiball, the game has *seven* multiballs!  Cool.\n\nThe main Multiball is kind of cool.  You hit both ramps (they're easy,\nnot as hard as they were on JP), then you hit both loops, then you do\nsome more stuff I didn't get to because all my balls drained!  ;-(\n\nThe rulecard has a *lot* of explanations on it, especially for a Sega\ngame!  It says how to play and start each of the five modes.  Good to\nsee a more descriptive rulecard, even if the font is so small and\npacked together that it is difficult to read...\n\nI noticed a *lot* of animations had been directly taken from the old\nDE Jurassic Park game.  The dual jackpot score animation during the\nmain Multiball, the \"Add X coins for Y credits\" screen, the Smart\nMissile animation, etc.  Even the \"Isla Nublar\" (or whatever the name\nof Site B is) animation at game start is very similar!\n\nI was half expecting to see \"They should all be destroyed!\" when I\nstarted my Extra Ball...  :-)\n\nAudio complaints: Like SWT, I notice a definite *decrease* in sound\nquality.  Twister was the last game I remember with really good sound\n(it went downhill starting with ID4).  The sound and music sounds\nshallow and tinny, like it was heard through a telephone.\n\nThe sampling rate seems very low (8khz?).  Even turning the volume up\nloud, as this game was, did not help to clarify the sound.  What is\nhappening here?  Frankenstein (the first Sega game) sounds so good,\nand it all seems to have gone downhill...\n\nI noticed that the game only has *ONE* backbox speaker!  The right\nspeaker cutout has been replaced with a flat piece of plastic, with\nthe Lost World logo.  I was wondering why all the sound was coming\nfrom the left, until I took a closer look.\n\nI looked under the cabinet, and saw the lower speaker is still intact.\nIt has been moved more forward, hopefully closer to the player.\nWouldn't it get in the way of the coin bucket?  (Maybe with pinball\nearnings nowadays, they've gone to smaller coin buckets?  :-))\n\nWell, it's a decent game, I will go back sometime soon and play it\nsome more (maybe even writing a real rulesheet for it?)!\n\n\n______\n\\Josh/ Lehan\n \\  /  mailto:krellan@netgate.net\n  \\/   http://www.netgate.net/~krellan/\n\n\n\nFrom krellan@netgate.net Wed Jun 25 03:52:13 1997\n\nI went and played some more LW tonight, and also got to see it with\nits glass off, so here's some more info:\n\nOnly two of the five modes have Multiball: Mobile Lab and Raptor.  In\nMobile Lab, hit the spinners a certain amount of times to launch\nanother ball into play and get the points, and repeat.  In Raptor, hit\nthe Raptor shot then hit any Raptor target to relight it, and repeat.\n\nThe Smart Missile *SUCKS*.  It no longer can be used to score every\ntarget!  It's only useful for starting Multiball when it's lit,\nsomething that is easy enough to do already.  The SM should be usable\nto hit everything, including the Super Jackpot (what a perfect\nopportunity for it!), but it can't.\n\nGPS seems unfair: if you fail to complete the mode in time, the next\nGPS you start is *harder*.  The number of ramps you must complete goes\nup by one.  So, if you fail to complete GPS early in the game, you\nwill probably -never- be able to complete it, because it keeps getting\nharder and harder, even when you keep losing!  This is a very poor\ndesign in my opinion; it should only get harder if it's successfully\ncompleted.\n\nSan Diego isn't very valuable, considering how hard it is to get.\nIt's a timed multiball mode, like Lost In The Zone.  Hit various\ntargets to boost a value that starts at 500K, and hit various shots to\ncollect the value.  You can collect it as much as you want without\nlowering its value; it will not go down when collected, so it\npotentially could be worth big points.\n\nBut, considering the mode is timed, it cuts out too early, so isn't\nworth very much.  If the mode lasted until all balls were drained, it\nwould be better.  As it is now, it is only about as good as a normal\nMultiball.  The sound is poor, the announcer just mumbles \"The T-Rex\nis loose in San Diego\".\n\nSPOILER: When you collect the points in San Diego, you see an\nanimation of the dinosaur munching on some guy, and blood and guts\nooze out of the dinosaur's mouth as it is chewing!  It's the most\nbloody/gross animation I have ever seen in pinball (Dracula included).\nThe dinosaur even burps after he's done eating...\n\nThe speech on this game is quite poor.  With a Jurassic Park license,\nI expected to hear a lot more from the movie!  The quote \"Here come\nthe pinballs\" is just stupid.  Same with \"Ow, the Snatcher got my\nball.\"  Pathetic.\n\nThe game isn't very in-depth at all!  We started Multiball from the\nSnatcher, did the five modes, then did San Diego.  That's *IT*.\nNothing more to the game!\n\nOh yeah, there's an Extra Ball at 6X and another one for hitting the\nRaptor lane four times.  No Special ;-(\n\nThe game doesn't make good use of the memorable movie scenes.  I was\nhoping for a mode where the convoy of hunters storms through the\nisland, and a \"shooting gallery\" mode where people run through a tall\ngrassy field and drop like flies :-)\n\nTwo people now have said that the \"Smart Missile!\" quote the game\nmakes is Bowen's voice.  Is it?\n\nThe \"squish/splat\" sound effect for the skill shot is from Tales Of\nThe Crypt, I've heard.  Many of the fonts and writing in the game is\nin that old DE-style font, as used in LW3 and other early dot matrix\ngames.  It seems they're dusting off a lot of old stuff and reusing\nit.\n\nThe playfield is noticeably barren, there's not much to do on it at\nall.  The ball is visible almost everywhere in the game, there are no\nhidden areas it goes to (except the Snatcher, of course).  It's easy\nto see the ball as it goes around the orbits, there's nothing back\nthere to block the view.  The downside of this is that the game\nquickly gets boring, though, because there's not much there to\nexplore...\n\nI must say that the playfield looks *sharp*, though.  The graphics are\nbright and clean, without being boring like the later Gottlieb\nartwork.  I like Sega's use of transparent plastics!  The inlane area\nand habitrails look elegant and nice.  The transparent colored standup\ntargets are a nice touch, the game really looks crisp.\n\nThe music is good, but repetitive.  The dino yells are nice, but not\nused nearly enough.  The other voices seem to have been thrown in\nwithout much thought, unfortunately (I'm sure they could have thought\nof a better quote than \"Here come the pinballs!\")...\n\nSega puts together a nice package with their lockdown bar and coin\ndoor (consistently better than WMS), and playfield appearance.  I\nwish the gameplay and sound was kept to the same standards, though.\n\nIdea: Why not cross-promote Sega's pinball games in the background of\nSega's simulator games?  They have a lot of fake \"billboards\" along\nthe racetracks and skateboard parks of their simulators, why not put\ntheir pinball games in those billboards?\n\n\n______\n\\Josh/ Lehan\n \\  /  mailto:krellan@netgate.net\n  \\/   http://www.netgate.net/~krellan/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Lost World", "possible_shots": "Site B: Spell SITEB, Mobile Lab: Spell TREX, Raptor: Spell RAPTOR, GPS: Hit the left ramp three times and the right ramp three times, Egg: Hit the Egg scoop several times", "manufacturer": "Sega", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/lostworld-notes.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Lost World", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I retain any and all rights\nto this guide.  You may take this guide and redistribute it and/or make\nchanges to it as long as it remains freely distributable and this policy is\nstated at the beginning of it.  No charge may be made from the distribution\nof this guide and no one may make a profit from it.  Send comments/updates/\nsuggestions/corrections to me.\n\nThe only other legal mush to say is that The Machine Bride of Pinbot is made\nby (and probably copyrighted/trademarked/whatever) by Williams Electronics.\n\nImportant Things\nThis is more or less a glossary of the shots that will be referred to during\nthe discussion of the game.\n\n\n Skill shot  There are 5 different lanes the ball can land in.  The way it\nis set up, the ball can get some weird spin on it and go pretty\nrandomly into one of the holes.\n Jets  The trio of jet bumpers in the upper-right area of the playfield.\n Left lane  The furthermost left shot possible, right next to the Shuttle\nRamp.  It is a precision shot.\n Shuttle Ramp  The big ramp on the left leading up to the face and the\nPinbot mini-playfield.\n Left loop  Starts just to the right of the Shuttle Ramp and exits down the\nleft lane.\n Heartbeat Ramp  The big u-turn ramp right in the middle of the playfield\nthat leads back to the right flipper through a double-\npassageway controlled by groves in the plastic.\n Spinner  Does nothing except score 1000/spin.\n Right loop  Starts to the right of the Jets/spinner passageway and exits\njust above the right slingshot and feeds to the LEFT flipper.\n Standup (5K) targets  1 on the left side, above the left slingshot, and 2\non the right just under the right loop entrance.\nGetting all 3 increases bonus multiplier.\n Face  The big cube with the flashing lights around it.  You really can't\nmiss it!  %)  Since it is a cube (well, rectangular prism anyway),\nthere are 4 faces on it.  It can rotate left or right to change.\n Pinbot mini-playfield  The platform on the upper-right corner on top of the\nJets.  When the ball goes up here, it can either\nfall into the Jets, feed to the right flipper via\nthe Heartbeat Ramp return lane, or feed to the skill\nshot via the path opposite of the Heartbeat Ramp.\n\n\nThe Loops\nThe loops work like this:  When no value on the loop is lit, you get the\nlowest one on there, and it starts flashing.  The flashing score is the LAST\nscore you got for that loop.  Actually, more specifically, it indicates the\nnext score you'll get by shooting the loop, which would be the next-highest\nnon-flashing one.\n\nOnce a score is flashing, it'll continue to flash until either you get the\nloop again, or it times out.  The amount of time depends on the loop.  If a\nvalue times out, it'll start counting down on the next-lowest value (if\nthere is one).  If the loop is at its highest value, then if the value times\nout, the loop will be back to the bottom again.\n\n\n Left loop  Scores 25K, 50K, 100K, 500K + light extra ball.  The shot will\ntime out about every 10 seconds, and you can only light the extra ball\nonce per ball or extra ball off of the loop, even if you start again from\n0.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on how many you can get for the\nwhole game, though.  Technically, you could have \"Ball 1\" forever.\n Heartbeat Ramp  I put it here because it counts as a loop.  It scores 100K,\n500K, 1M.  It times out between 5-8 seconds.  Usually easily backhanded\nfrom the right flipper for unlimited millions.\n Right loop  Scores 25K, 50K, 100K, 500K + light jackpot.  Like the extra\nball, the jackpot can only be lit from the loop once per ball or extra\nball.  If the ball goes in far enough through the EXIT of the loop (to\nhit the microswitch at the end), you'll get a free advance bonus\nmultiplier.\n\n Loop combos  A loop combo is scored by shooting a number of loops in fairly\nquick succession (not more than 3-4 seconds between loops, if that much).\nThe combo starts at 4 loops.  Getting 4 loops pretty quickly will cause\nthe game to start making lots of banging/explosion-type noises and say\n\"4 loop combo - 500,000 points.\"  After that, the number required for a\ncombo goes up by one, and each of them are worth 1M.  No matter how many\nyou get, all except the 4-loop combo are worth 1M.  The number of loops\nneeded for the next combo is given to you in the Status Report.\n 10-Loop combo  Supposedly, if you work your way up to getting a 10-loop\ncombo (this means getting the 4, 5, ..., 9-loop ones first!), you score\nthe \"Backdoor Billion.\"  I have never done this.  Someone tested the\nBackdoor Billion theory with the glass off by hitting the Heartbeat Ramp\nsensor over and over.  This might not have been the best way to test it,\nbut it did in fact give him the Billion after 51 Heartbeat Ramps.\nGetting a 10-loop combo means shooting 49 ramps, so it is still unclear\nto me if it is the 10-loop combo or hitting 51 Heartbeats in a row.\n(Which is a pretty damn hard thing to do.)\n\n Jets  These do not count as loops, but the Jets bonus is displayed in much\nthe same way as a loop score.  Hitting the Jets a certain number of times\n(I have no clue as to the exact number; I estimate 50) advances you a\nJets level, which goes from 25K, 50K, 100K, and 500K.  Nothing special\nother than these bonus points, though.  Not even the value of the Jets\ngoes up.  (It's always 10K/hit if you want to know.)  After getting the\n500K, the number of hits needed to get the next bonus goes up a bit.\n\n\nAt the end of a ball, the number of loops you got that ball is multiplied by\n10K and added to your total bonus, which can then be multiplied.\n\nLeft Lane\nThe left lane serves 3 purposes:  Spin the small wheel, collect jackpot, and\n\"power charge\" during multiball.\n\nSmall Wheel:  Shooting the ball up the left lane ANYtime except during\nmultiball and when the jackpot is lit spins the small wheel.  Your awards\nare:\n\n\n Light Jackpot\n 250K\n Extra Ball\n LIGHT Extra Ball\n 50K\n 100K\n\n\nThis is hardly a random feature.  It will give you whatever it damn well\npleases (i.e. 90% 2, 5, or 6).\n\n\n Collect Jackpot  The jackpot ranges from 1M - 8M and is increased by\nnormal play (usually hitting Jets).  You can light the jackpot by either\ngetting it from the small wheel or by shooting the right loop 4 times.\nYou get 20 seconds to try to shoot it back up the left lane.\n Power Charge  This is a score you get for getting it up the left lane\nduring multiball.  It starts at 100K and goes up 100K with each shot up\nto 1M.  These points are NOT doubled during multiball, and resets to 100K\nat the start of each multiball.\n\n\nShuttle Ramp\nThe reason the Shuttle Ramp is called the Shuttle Ramp is because of the big\npicture of a space shuttle in front of it.  When lit, a solid shot up the\nramp will send the ball into the Pinbot area.  Otherwise, the ball will go\ninto the Face.\n\nHere is the normal sequence of events for shooting the ball up the ramp:\n\n Pinbot area\n Face - activate voice; 250K; Face changes to #2.\n Pinbot area\n Face - partial optical link (1st eye); 250K; launch another ball.\n Pinbot area (maybe)\n Face - 2nd eye; activates optics; 1M (500K x 2); starts multiball; Face\nchanges to #3.\n\n\nIn multiball, all scoring is doubled (except for Big Wheel awards, the\njackpot, and Power Charges).  Also, the main goal is to get the balls back\nup the ramp.  Here's what happens as you do:\n\n 1st ball on Face #3 - Human Influx; 500K (250K x 2); ball is locked.\n 2nd ball on Face #3 - Metamorphosis; 1.5M (750K x 2); changes to Face #4;\nballs released again.\n 1st ball on Face #4 - Increased Pulse; 500K (250K x 2); ball is locked.\n 2nd ball on Face #4 - Spins the Big Wheel; 2M (1M x 2); releases both\nballs to try to spin the Big Wheel again.\n\n\nBig Wheel awards:\n\n 10 Million\n 50 Million\n Special\n 5 Million\n 1 Million (what a ripoff!!)\n Lights 1 Billion (collected by shooting Heartbeat Ramp in 12 seconds)\n\n\nWhen multiball ends, what happens next depends on how far you got.  If you\nDIDN'T get a metamorphosis, then your next left lane or Face shot will turn\nthe face back to #2 (the eyes).  (You're much better off trying to turn it\nback via the left lane since you'll get points that way.  You don't get\nsquat if you shoot the ramp.)\n\nIf you DID get metamorphosis, then at the end of multiball the next Face/\nleft lane shot will turn her back to Face #1!  Even if you didn't get a\nsingle Big Wheel spin.  Also, as noted above, getting metamorphosis causes\nthe Shuttle to light in between eye shots on Face #2.\n\nThe face can get screwed up on some machines (for instance, only being able\nto turn to the right).  When this happens, the machine will tend to do some\nstrange things (esp. if it's on the 1st face during multiball %) ).\nHowever, you'll always get credit for shooting whatever you're SUPPOSED to\nbe on eventually.  (I've experienced \"Partial optical link\" - \"I can speak!\"\n- \"Partial optical link\" all with ONE shot.)\n\nPinbot values:\n100K - 200K - 300K - 100K - 200K - 300K - 600K + light extra ball\nThe Pinbot values are scored every time the ball enters the area.  It resets\nafter awarding the extra ball.  So every 7 Pinbot shots lights the extra\nball.\n\nMisc. Scoring\nThe bonus and bonus multiplier seem to have no limit.  I've gotten over 1.4M\nbase bonus before (excluding loops), and a multiplier of 6x.  I've heard of\nsomeone getting at least 9x bonus.  The best way to rack up bonus is to\nshoot the Jets.  If you get all of the Jets awards in one ball, your bonus\nwill be well over 1M before loops.  The highest total bonus I've gotten is\nlike 11.9M with multipliers.\n\nAnother potentially big source of points is the skill shot.  The skill shot\nmultiplier will start at 1x for the beginning of each ball.  This is ONLY\nregulation balls in play.  EVERY time the ball goes back to the plunger, be\nit from the Pinbot area, shooting another ball after locking one in the eye,\nor starting an extra ball for that ball, the multiplier will increase by 1.\nI've gotten it up to around 17x, and I've heard of it being as high as 23x.\nThat could potentially be a whopping 4.6M for the skill shot!\n\nSince none of these seem to have limits, they can really help out your score\nin the long run.  You'll never score a billion by just going for these\nscores, but they can help your standing in the high scores or Billionaire's\nClub.\n\nWIMP extra ball:  Lit when the game feels terribly sorry for you.  If you've\nhad a really bad game (no Shuttle Ramp shots, few (if any) loops, and a low\nscore) then the extra ball will be lit for you.  There's no warning, it just\nis.  There are lots of games that do this; BoP is by no means unique in this\nregard.  (What are some others?  T2, HS2, Diner, Dr. Dude, Police Force,\netc.)\n\nAlso on the third ball, if you haven't hit the Shuttle Ramp yet, it'll spot\nyou the Pinbot area (well, you won't get points for it) so you can shoot\ndirectly for Activate Voice.\n\n\"High\" Scores\nSince BoP is a special case, some explanation is needed for the way it\nhandles high scores.\n\nWilliams knew it would be unfair to put billion-point scores in the regular\nhigh score chart (since it can only hold 5), so they came up with the\n\"Billionaire's Club.\"  This separate high score chart keeps track of the top\n19-20 scores for anyone who's made the billion shot.\n\nI say 19-20 top scores, because any time you make the billion shot, you are\nGUARANTEED to get onto the Billionaire's Club.  If your final score is lower\nthan the lowest total in the Club, then you'll still get to put your\ninitials in, get your 2 credits (if that's what your machine is set for),\nand get 20th spot in the Club.\n\nThen there's the standard high-score table.  This has Grand Champion and the\nother more recent top 4 scores just like any modern Williams pin.  Now,\nthough it's good that they split them up, this brings in the 50 million Big\nWheel award.  It's not really a problem if you get the billion too, but if\nyou just get the 50M, that'll throw off your score more than anything else\nin the game.  Surprisingly enough, the 50M is a bigger score-unbalancer than\nthe billion shot!  They really should have come up with something else, but\nwhat can you do?\n\nStrategies\nShoot the Shuttle Ramp.\n\nSeriously, though, that really is the point of the game, is mastering the\nShuttle Ramp.  It's too bad, but if no one at your machine can make the\nbillion, than maybe some of these suggestions will help.  Even though it is\nobviously a one-shot game, I still really enjoy playing it because it's a\ngood challenge and provides excellent practice in handling multiball.\n\nWell, first I'll start with multiball.  If you want to go for the billion,\nthen you have to get the balls back up the ramp.  There are a few ways to do\nthis:\n\n\n   Hold up the left flipper as the balls come down, and give the game a\nlittle upward nudge to get the ball to the right.  Shoot the first\none back immediately, since you don't have a terribly long time until\nthe other ball gets down there too.  If your game isn't maintained\nvery well (like ours), then it'll eventually get too slow to be able\nto do this.\n   Shoot both balls up the Heartbeat Ramp to pass them to the right\nflipper.  Risky, since all but 1 BoP I've played has the Heartbeat\nRamp center drain you on a weak shot up the Ramp.  You can usually\nnudge the ball back to safety, but still...\n   Shoot the first ball through the right loop, then backhand it up the\nShuttle Ramp.  This actually works on our machine most of the time.\nThis shot is also probably going to take a little practice.  Also, on\nour machine, the backhand shot is usually the same time the second\nball gets to the left flipper, so it doubles as being able to quasi-\nlive-trap the second ball so you can take your time getting it back\nup the ramp.\n   Since I can't pass balls via method 1, the way I do it all the time\nnow (unless I want a challenge) is to shoot both balls up into the\nJets!  Usually the first one will stay up there long enough to get\nthe second one up there, too.  They'll both thrash for awhile (and at\n20K per bumper hit, that's not bad), and usually feed out at a pretty\ndecent interval.  When the first ball comes down, I dead-trap it, and\nthen it's in perfect position to shoot it up the Shuttle Ramp.  Do\nthe same thing with the other ball (dead-trap it).\n\n\nNow some other scoring strategies since we've discussed the most important\nones (to get the billion!).\n\nSince scoring is doubled during multiball, one good idea is to hold 1 ball\nin the left flipper or lock it in the Face and shoot the Heartbeat Ramp.\nThis will give you unlimited 2-millions.\n\nAvoid the Power Charge shot; it really isn't worth the trouble it is to hit\nit.  Especially if you consider that a miss will often hit the left rubber\non the Shuttle Ramp and go down the left outlane.\n\nAlways shoot the Jets when you can.  The amount of bonus you can get from\nthem is just enormous after awhile.  And usually you'll get a safe return to\nthe right flipper.  There are those times, however...\n\nIf you're getting bored with the billion, or you're really good at loops,\ntry to shoot the left loop (extra ball) at the start of each ball.  This can\nmake your games last a long time.  Don't forget about the standard lane-\nchange feature!  Except that in this game, the left flipper moves the extra\nball light to the left, and the right flipper moves it to the right.  This\nis instead of the normal \"any-hit-moves-the-target-to-the-right\" routine.\nIf you shoot the Shuttle Ramp and your ball will come back, there's no\nreason not to get the extra ball.  Note that the Heartbeat Ramp feeds the\nball BELOW the return lane sensor, so you can't collect the extra ball from\nthe Heartbeat Ramp.  Tricky, huh?\n\nI nifty shot I've developed on our machine is to get in a right loop-left\nloop groove.  You can start by shooting the right loop, then just at the\nright moment, backhand the ball (still with the left flipper) up the right\nloop.  The ball should come back in just the right spot to return it to the\nright loop, etc.  You can get fairly high-numbered combos doing this.  (I've\nonly gotten up to a 6-loop combo, BTW.)\n\nDon't forget that the loop combos are ANY loops.  Hitting the Heartbeat Ramp\n4 times in a row counts as a 4-loop combo.\n\nIf you have a high bonus (you can check with status report), then consider\nactually shooting for the standup targets.  They are not really dangerous\nand can be worth a lot in the long run.  Usually they'll often just hit\nthemselves, so it's not a big deal.  Just keeping the ball alive can net you\nsome high multipliers, whether you mean to or not.  Don't aim for the bottom\nof the right loop, though; that's usually a sure drain, and the ball will go\nup there by itself off of a slingshot or something.\n\nThere's a bug in the game (unless it falls into the \"it's-not-a-bug-it's-a-\nfeature\" dept.) where you shoot your 2nd ball into the Power Charge at the\nend of multiball.  If you get credit for the Power Charge while the other\nball is being registered at the bottom of the drain where it kicks it back\nto the reserve, DOUBLE SCORING WILL STAY ACTIVE!  Really!  I had noticed\nthis before, but only recently realized the circumstances at which it\nhappened.  Right after I realized it, I shot for it after the end of my next\nmultiball, and it worked.  So if you have a drain, shoot for the Power\nCharge as soon as you can.  If you get it at the right time, you're golden.\nHowever, it WILL end if you shoot the ball back up the Shuttle Ramp.  It\nmight also end if you shoot the Power Charge again, but I'm not sure about\nthat.\n\nEvery time you get a chance, either slam tilt or power-cycle the game (when\nthe guys are not looking of course).  It seems that the designers have put a\nlot (if not most) of their birthdays into the machines.  After said slam\ntilt or power-cycle, if it's a birthday, you'll see Happy Birthday xxx and\nhear a couple of bars of Happy Birthday in that unusual and distinctive\nBride of Pinbot style.  Sounds neat!  I've seen 3 so far.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "The Machine: Bride of Pinbot", "possible_shots": "Skill shot, Jets, Left lane, Shuttle Ramp, Left loop, Heartbeat Ramp, Spinner, Right loop, Standup (5K) targets, Face, Pinbot mini-playfield", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronics", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/brideofpinbot.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: The Machine: Bride of Pinbot", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

After hitting the captive ball the ball is fed to a habitrail\nthat leads to the right inlane.  Hit the captive ball with the plunged\nball.  The captive ball moves up a short path over 3 rollover switches\nand into a standup if plunged hard.  You collect the award associated\nwith the last switch touched on the way up.  The awards are:\n\n\n   1st switch: Jackpot\n   2nd switch: Lock Ball (begin regular multiball)\n   3rd switch: Race Strategy (see below)\n\nStandup (Crash and Burn): 30 points + 1 gallon fuel\n\nAfter collecting an award (except Crash and Burn) that award is no\nlonger available until the other awards have also been collected.\n\nRaces\nThe primary goal of Mario Andretti is to win races and advance to the\nWorld Championship.  There are 17 numbered car-shaped lights forming a\nrace track in the middle of the playfield.  Advance around the track by\nhitting lit yellow Mario shots (which also causes the spinning cars to\nrotate faster and faster), the spinning cars themselves, sling shots\nand/or pop bumpers.  Complete a certain number of laps to complete a\nrace and receive a Checkered Flag Award (see below.)  The first race is\n1 lap in length and all subsequent races are 2 laps.\n\nDuring each race making a shot lit green (\"Pass\") advances you one\nposition.  If you are already in 1st place then shooting a green shot\nadvances the \"pass bonus\" by 5 million.  Shooting a red shot\n(\"Yield\") drops you back one position.  You start each race in 1st place\n- complete the race in 1st place to get \"Victory Circle\".  Finishing\nthree races in 1st place (three Victory Circle's) starts the World\nChampionship (see below.)  Finishing a race also gives an award based on\nyour position at the end of the race:\n\n\n    1st Place: 50,000,000 and lights EB standup for a period of time\n    2nd Place: 30,000,000\n    3rd Place: 10,000,000\n    4th and lower: Nothing\n\n\nFuel & Pit Stops\nYou start the game with 5 gallons of fuel.  Each lap uses 1 gallon of\nfuel.  If you run out of fuel you can no longer advance cars around the\ntrack until you \"Pit In\" by shooting the right hole.  Sometimes Pit In\nwill be lit before you completely run out of fuel and I'm not yet sure\nwhy this is.  Either way you must shoot the right hole to make a pit\nstop.  Shooting the right hole when lit for \"Pit In\" awards 3 gallons\nfuel and lets you continue advancing around the track.  Fuel can also be\ncollected during normal play via Track Awards, Mystery Awards, the\nPass/Yield Round and the \"Crash and Burn\" skill shot award.\n\nCheckered Flag Awards\nCompleting a race in any position gives you a choice between two\nawards/modes (except when you get World Championship).  There are left\nawards and right awards which advance independently.  Choose an award\nwith the corresponding flipper button.  If you don't select a particular\naward it will be offered again the next time.  The sequence of awards is\nas follows:\n\n\nLEFT AWARDRIGHT AWARD\n   Redline Round            Multiball        \n   Race Strategy     Pass/Yield Round \n   Super Jackpot           5 Jackpots       \n Spin Cars Round          Multiball        \n        Complete (*)              Complete (*)     \n\n(*) \"Complete\" is not actually an award, rather it indicates that you've\nselected all available awards on that side.  Selecting \"Complete\" will\ngive you the award on the other side (i.e. the incomplete side) just as\nif you had selected it. I'm not yet sure if anything special happens if\nyou complete both sides.\n\nRedline Round - 2-ball multiball round.  This round starts with a skill\nshot - the top rollover switch (Race Strategy) is lit, making it gives\nyou [???] After the skill shot multiball begins.  Shoot the red \"Tach\"\nstandups 5 times (each worth basically nothing) and then each subsequent\ntach shot is worth 50 million as long as multiball lasts.  As soon as\nthe tach is lit for 50 million the up post, left outlane kickback and\nright outlane diverter *all* become disabled, making this round a bit\nof a \"sucker shot\".\n\nMultiball - (see below)\n\nRace Strategy - (see below)\n\nPass/Yield Round - interesting one ball mode.  All the \"light\" shots are\nlit green.  Hitting green lights (\"Pass\") advances the award and changes\nthe shot to a red light (\"Yield\").  Collect the current award and end\nthe round at any time by shooting the right hole.  If you shoot a red\nlight the round ends but you can still collect the current award at the\nright hole for a period of time.  Here's the awards in order:\n\n\n 1 gallon\n 2 gallons\n 50,000,000\n 100,000,000\n Extra Ball\n Spin Cars Round\n [???]\n\n\nSpin Cars Round - lucrative 3-ball multiball round.  This round starts\nwith two skill shots in a row.  The top rollover (Race Strategy) is lit.\nGetting it awards the double jackpots Race Strategy award if you haven't\nalready received it (i.e. jackpots doubled for rest of ball!!)  The\nsecond skill shot awards [???]  After two skill shots multiball begins.\nEach time the spinning cars are rotated scores a jackpot.  The Jackpot\nstandup is also lit for jackpot.  During the round shoot either side of\nthe hairpin horseshoe, or the cars themselves to spin the cars and\ncollect jackpots.  This round can rack up serious points.\n\nMultiball\nRegular multiball can be started via a skill shot, Checkered Flag Award,\nrandom award, or automatically on ball 3 if you have not already played\nregular multiball.  Multiball begins with a skill shot - the 2nd\nrollover (Lock Ball) is lit.  If missed 2-ball multiball begins, but if\nyou make the skill shot you are given a second skill shot (and thus a\n3rd ball) in which the 1st and 3rd rollovers are lit.  Shooting one\ncollects the respective award (Jackpot or Race Strategy).  3-ball\nmultiball begins regardless.\n\nMultiball starts with three shots lit: left and right hairpin turn and\nthe right loop.  Each is worth 10 million points.  Once all three are\ncollected they relight and the \"Tach\" is added for 20 million each, plus\nthe right standup (just above the right slingshot) is lit for Jackpot\nand stays lit even if hit.  Once all the 20 million shots are collected\nthey relight and the right hole is added.  Each of these scores a\nJackpot.  After all 5 jackpots are collected the left ramp lights for\nSuper Jackpot.  After collecting the SJ the 5 shots relight for jackpot\nand then the ramp for SJ.  Repeat.\n\nYour state in the sequence carries over between multiballs so that you\ndon't have to recollect awards and jackpots you've already collected in\na previous multiball.  However, if you collect at least one Super\nJackpot your next multiball starts over at the beginning.\n\nJackpot & Super Jackpot\nJackpot can be collected via multiball, Track Award 3 and 16, Checkered\nFlag Awards, Hurry Up, skill shots and mystery awards.  The jackpot\nvalue starts out at 30 million and is advanced by 5 million during\nnormal play via shooting either side of the hairpin and then hitting the\nTach before it stops flashing.  It can also be advanced by random awards\nand Track Awards.\n\nSuper Jackpot can be collected via multiball, World Championship,\nCheckered Flag Awards and mystery awards [???].  It begins at 200\nmillion and is advanced 100 million by shooting the Stop Watch when it\nis flashing (see below).  It can also be advanced by Track Awards and\nmystery awards.\n\nRace Strategy\nRace Strategy is lit at the left ramp for a period of time after each\nlap that doesn't complete a race.  Shoot the ramp when lit to collect\nRace Strategy.  It can also be collected via mystery awards and Track\nAward 8.  Race Strategy gives you one of a set of possible awards:\n\n\n  Pop bumpers 10,000,000 for rest of ball\n  Right loop 10,000,000 for rest of ball\n  Slingshots 10,000,000 for rest of ball\n  Spinning cars 10,000,000 for rest of ball\n  Hairpin turn 10,000,000 for rest of ball\n  Pit stop (right hole) 30,000,000 for rest of ball\n  Super jackpot doubled for rest of ball\n  Jackpot doubled for rest of ball\n  Fuel trade - option to trade your fuel for something:\n\n      1 - 9 gallons: [what for each???]\n      10 or more gallons: trade 10 gallons for EB (once only.)\n\n  [other race strategy awards???]\n\n\nWorld Championship\nStart World Championship by winning 3 races.  WC is a 3-ball multiball\nthat starts with two skill shots with the top rollover (Race Strategy)\nlit.  Making the skill shot awards [???]  After both skill shots\nmultiball begins.  All major shots are lit to advance cars around the\ntrack.  Each lap completed awards a Super Jackpot.\n\nTrack Award\nAt the beginning of each lap Track Award is lit at the right hole if\nit was not already lit (track awards are *not* stacked).  Each\ncar-shaped light that forms the race track has a number next to it.\nShooting Track Award gives you the correspondingly numbered award:\n\n\n 5 Gallons Fuel\n 50,000,000\n 3 Jackpots\n Green Lights (all pass/yield shots light green)\n Advance Jackpot (+ 5,000,000)\n 1 Gallon Fuel\n Advance Super Jackpot (+ 100,000,000)\n Race Strategy\n Post Up (raises post for a period of time)\n Begin Hurry-Up (Jackpot or EB standup lit for a period of time)\n 3 Gallons Fuel\n Advance Super Jackpot (+ 100,000,000)\n 30,000,000\n Complete Lap\n 1 Gallon Fuel\n 5 Jackpots\n Extra Ball (once per game) or Advance Jackpot (+ 5,000,000)\n\n\nAfter collecting a track award, Track Award cannot be collected again\nuntil the next lap.\n\nMystery Award\nMystery is alternately lit and unlit at the left ramp on slingshot,\npop bumper and tach hits.  If Race Strategy is lit at the ramp,\nMystery will not be lit.  Shoot the ramp when lit for Mystery to\ncollect a random award:\n\n\n 1 to 10 Gallons Fuel\n Post Up\n 1 to 5 Jackpots\n Multiball\n Race Strategy\n 500,000,000 (!!!)\n Complete Lap\n [... ???]\n\n\nStop Watch\nThe right loop is lit for Stop Watch when you shoot it or the left ramp\nwhen the right loop isn't lit for something else.  Once lit it will\nremain lit until you start the Stop Watch or the right loop is lit for\nsomething else.  When lit shoot the right loop to start the Stop Watch -\na timer begins counting up. Shoot the right loop again to stop the stop\nwatch.  If you hit some other switch in between the round ends and you\nmust relight it again. If you do make the shot you receive an award\nbased upon your time:\n\n\n 0 to 2.99 seconds: Advance Super Jackpot 100,000,000.\n 3 to 3.99 seconds: Add 3 gallons fuel.\n 4 to 6.99 seconds: Add 1 gallon fuel (crash & burn.)\n 7 or greater: Nothing.\n\n\nIn addition if your time is lower than the best time you win a free game\n- interestingly the game stops immediately to let you enter your\ninitials rather than waiting for the end of the game.\n\n[Presumably the max Super Jackpot value is 900,000,000 like Big Hurt,\net. al.]\n\nChamps\nThere are several \"champs\" that MA keeps track of.  I don't think these\nnames are right, but the idea is:\n\n\n Normal High Scores and Grand Champ\n Single Ball Champ: Highest score on one ball gets initials & game\n Stop Watch Champ: Shortest stop watch time gets initials & game\n\n\nBall Saves\nMario Andretti has unusual, very Premier-ean rules for ball saves.  At\nthe beginning of each ball the left outlane kickback, right outlane\ndiverter and up post are all enabled for a fairly long period of time.\nDuring this time balls can be saved over and over again (however, if the\nball slips past a raised flipper you won't get it back.) After this time\nexpires the up post drops and one of the two outlane saves remains\nenabled.  The left slingshot enables the right outlane diverter save and\ndisables the left and the right slingshot enables the left outlane\nkickback and disables the right (like I said - very Premier-ean! :) The\nup-post is also raised for a short period of time when you shoot the\nright loop.\n\nIn addition Mario Andretti has guaranteed ball time.  If you have not\nhad the minimum ball time it will repeatedly give you the ball back\nafter your third ball until you do get the minimum ball time.  Note\nthat any extra balls you collected on your 3rd ball come first.\n\nBonus\nEnd of ball bonus is:\n\n\n Pass Bonus\n\n\nAt the end of the game you also receive:\n\n\n 10,000,000 x Gallons Fuel\n\nStrategy\n[...]\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Mario Andretti", "manufacturer": "Gottleib Premier", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/marioandretti.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Mario Andretti", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Maverick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Maverick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional and Amateur Pinball Association's Guide\nto Sega's Maverick\n\nVersion as of January 11, 1995\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: This rule sheet is meant as a guideline only, and is\nnot an official documentation. To the best of our knowledge, the\ninformation contained in this rule sheet is accurate. However, due to\nvarious ROM editions, operator setup options, and tournament\nmodes, the rules of any particular game may deviate from those\nlisted below. The rules of the game are always final, and any discrepancies\nbetween this rule sheet and the actual game rules cannot\nbe used as a basis for protest.\n\nThis rule sheet was written by Dave Stewart for distribution at PAPA-5.\n\n1. Playfield Description\n\nDrop Targets  The main feature on Maverick are the four banks of\ndrop targets, plus the two stand-up targets on either side of the\nramp. Each of these score cards, which are used for playing poker.\nSee Section 2 for details on the different drop target banks and for\nscoring.\n\nLauren Bell  A model of the Lauren Bell riverboat is on the playfield.\nIt is used to store locked balls, and to collect awards during\nthe Lauren Bell mode. Balls are diverted into the Lauren Bell\nfrom the left and right orbits.\n\nLeft and Right Orbits  The orbits can either loop around to the other\norbit, feed the Lauren Bell, or feed the rollovers. Several orbit\nshots (as shown in the Status Display) will light the right ramp for\na mystery award. Each orbit is also a dollar shot for some of the\nmodes.\n\nVertical Up-Kicker (VUK)  Just to the right of Lauren Bell, this shot\nis used to raise or fold a hand (see Section 2), play blackjack to\nrelight the kickback, collect extra balls when lit, and is a dollar\nshot for some of the modes.\n\nRamp (Stagecoach)  The ramp is used to light lock, collect mystery\nawards, collect jackpots during multiball, and it is a dollar shot for\nsome of the modes.\n\nRollovers/Advance Bonus Multiplier  At the top center of the playfield\nare four rollovers, representing the four card suits. Shoot all\nfor to advance the end-of-ball bonus multiplier (to 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x,\nto 10x). Note that a mystery award can set the multiplier to\n20x.\n\nPop Bumpers  Start at 250K per hit, and resets each ball. Increased\nby 250K after every 10 hits up to a maximum of 1M. The super-pops\nskill shot can set the pop bumper value to 2M per hit for the\nrest of the ball, and the mega-pops mystery award set it to 3M for\nthe rest of the ball.\n\nPlunger Skill Shot  The plunger can shoot the ball to one of five\nplaces. The first three holes score the award indicated on the display\nif that hole is lit. The award for the first hole is always light\nlock, for the second hole it is always start mode, and the third hole\nis usually super-pops, but can be extra ball or lite special on ball 2\nor 3 if the player has a low score. Each of these three awards can\nonly be scored once each, until all 3 have been awarded. Shooting\nthe ball in an un-lit hole scores 5M. The fourth hole feeds the\nupper right flipper for a shot at the captive ball. Hit the captive\nball to start drop poker, where every drop target is worth 2M for\n20 seconds. The fifth is to shoot the ball all the way around the\nhabitrail to the left inlane. This scores whatever is lit on the\nramp.\n\nCaptive ball  The captive ball is under the Lauren Bell and behind\nthe upper-left drop targets. When not lit, it scores 10M. It can be\nlit for Super Jackpot during multiball, and is lit during Bank Heist\nmode.\n\n\n2. Playing Poker\nIn normal 1-ball play, the object of the game is to beat the playfield's\nhand by completing all drop targets in the flashing drop target bank.\nThe possible hands that may be flashing are the following:\n\n\nRoyal Flush  The lower left bank with 5 drop targets.\n\nStraight  The upper-left bank under Lauren Bell, and also has 5 drop\ntargets.\n\nFour of a kind  The right bank with 4 drop targets.\n\nThree of a kind  The center bank with 3 drop targets.\n\nTwo of a kind  The two stand-up targets on either side of the\nramp.\n\nFull House  In some cases, both the three-of-a-kind and two-of-a-kind\nbanks are flashing, which forms the full house.\n\n\nThe game deals the cards by resetting all the drop targets, and lighting\none of the above hands. You must hit all the drop targets in the lit bank\nto win a poker chip. However, if you hit any drop target not in the lit\nbank, it counts as a discard. If your total number of discards hits 0,\nyou lose the hand. Your current number of discards is shown on the\ndisplay. At the beginning of the game you start with 11 or 12, but as\nthe game progresses the number of discards is decreased (thus making\nit more difficult to win a hand, as you are at higher risk of losing a\nhand.)\n\nThere are many factors to computing your score for winning a poker\nhand. Your base value for each poker hand is 5M times your current\nwinning streak, which is the number of poker chips you have won in a\nrow without losing a hand. Your winning streak is also increased by\none when you win a hand. This value can be increased in several\nways, as follows.\n\nRaise/Fold: If you shoot the VUK before completing the drop target\nbank, you are given a choice to raise or fold. If you raise, then the\nvalue of that hand is doubled. If you subsequently win the hand by\nhitting the flashing drop target bank before discards hits 0, then\nyou score 10M times your current winning streak, and your winning\nstreak is incremented by 2. If you fold, the game re-deals,\nresets the drop targets, and selects a different hand for you to complete.\nNote that if you fold, your winning streak count is not\naffected, and therefore it is advantageous to fold than to lose a\nhand.\n\nPerfect: If you complete the flashing drop target bank without discarding\n(that is, without hitting any other drop target), you score a\nperfect hand, and the score for that hand is tripled. Therefore, if\nyou did not raise, you score 15M times your current winning\nstreak, and increase winning streak by one, and if you did raise,\nyou score 30M times your current winning streak, and increase\nyour winning streak by two.\n\nClose Call: If you complete the flashing drop target bank with only\none discard remaining, you get a close call, and the score for that\nhand is doubled. Therefore, if you did not raise, you score 10M\ntimes your current winning streak, and increase winning streak by\none, and if you did raise, you score 20M times your current winning streak,\nand increase your winning streak by two.\n\nNote that hitting a drop target on a non-flashing bank is not considered\na discard if it is \"not your fault\". That is, if hit as a ricochet off a\nsuccessful hit (which the game detects as hitting within 2 seconds of a hit\nof a drop target on a flashing bank) or if the ball is hit immediately\nafter a pop-bumper hit, it is not counted as a discard.\n\nEach drop target can only be a discard once, since the target stays\ndown until a new hand is dealt. However, the stand-up targets on\neither side of the ramp can continually count as discards. Shooting\neither of these targets when the other one is lit and the pair is flashing\nwill score the other.\n\nYou can spot cards in your drop target bank by hitting the VUK within\n2 seconds of the ball going down either inlane. The dollar chip on the\nVUK will flash for these 2 seconds. That card that is spotted is always\nthe lowest target not yet hit (based on the physical locations on the\nplayfield).\n\nCompleting five poker chips awards the flashing 25M poker chip and\nstarts the corresponding mode, as described in the next section.\n\nThe Start Mode skill shot will award as many poker chips as necessary\nto complete all five poker chips, and increase the winning streak\nby that number of poker chips.\n\n3. Modes\nEarning five poker chips awards the flashing 25M poker chip and\nstarts the corresponding mode, which is one of the following:\n\nCoop's Cash: All four dollar shots are lit, and the timer is set to 30\nseconds. Within this time, shoot each one for 10M a piece, which\nlights a roving shot for 50M. Collect the 50M and the mode restarts,\nthe timer is reset to 30 seconds, and this time each shot is\n20M, and completing those lights a 100M roving shot. Collecting\nthe roving shot again re-starts the mode and resets the timer, but\nthe values of the shots do not increase anymore.\n\n\nLauren Bell  Shoot the riverboat through either orbit to score\n10M+10M to 100M and a mystery value. The mode lasts 30 seconds.\nThe mystery value can be one of the following:\n\n\n\tInfinite Discard\n\t20x Bonus\n\tMega Pops\n\tLaser Kickback\n\tLight Extra Ball\n\tExtra Ball\n\t50M\n\tLite Special\n\tSpecial\n\t10M to 100M random point award\n\n\nIn tournament settings, the mystery value is always scored in the\nabove order, with extra balls worth 50M and specials worth\n100M.\n\nBank Heist  Shoot the captive ball for 100M, 200M+Lite Extra Ball,\nand 300M. Mode ends after 30 seconds or if the captive ball is hit\nthree times.\n\nAngel's Revenge  A frenzy mode with every switch worth 250K, and\nincreases by 250K after every 10 hits. In addition to scoring these\npoints, a bounty value is also maintained of equal value. Shoot the\nVUK to score this bounty value. The mode ends after 30 seconds.\n\nStagecoach  The right ramp is lit for a progressive jackpot, which is\ninitially 10M and increases by 1M for each drop target hit, and by\n10M for each successful ramp shot. Mode ends after 30 seconds.\n\n\nAfter completing each of the above modes, win five more poker chips\nto start the Poker Championship.\n\n4. Poker Championship\nA 4-ball multiball mode, with a ball saver enabled for 30-seconds.\nYou must manually plunge the balls, or the game will not serve up\nnew balls.\n\nEach drop target bank begins flashing. Knock down all drop targets in\na bank to make it solid. Make all four drop target banks solid to light\nthe VUK. Shoot the VUK to collect the Championship Pot.\n\nEach drop target adds 1M times number of balls in play to this pot,\nand completing a bank adds 10M times number of balls in play to the\npot. The captive ball adds 100M to the pot.\n\nAfter collecting the pot, all drop target banks go back to flashing, and\nyou can repeat to collect another championship pot. The pot continues\nto increase even after collecting it; it does not reset after winning it,\nand therefore can grow to be quite large.\n\n5. Blackjack\nThe VUK is lit for Blackjack whenever the kickback is not lit. Shoot\nthe VUK to play blackjack. Use the right flipper to hit, and the left\nflipper to stand. The machine then deals itself a hand. If you are the\nwinner, you score 1M for each point of your hand (so if you have 19,\nyou score 19M), and you relight the kickback. The dealer always hits\non 16 and lower, and stands on 17 and higher.\n\nDuring a mode or in multiball, you do not play blackjack. Instead, the\nmachine randomly lights the kickback, on average for every second\nshot to the VUK.\n\nIn tournament mode, playing blackjack is not random. You will win\nthe 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. if you always hit on 16 and lower and stand on 17\nand higher. Similarly, when in a mode or multiball, it will always\nrelight the kickback every second shot.\n\n6. Multiball\nLite multiball by shooting the right ramp to light the lock. The number\nof ramp shots required is variable based on game settings. After each\nramp shot, the display tells you how many more are needed to light\nthe lock. The lock can also be lit by a skill shot.\n\nOnce a lock is lit, shoot the right orbit to lock the ball. After locking\nball 1, you get a plunger skill shot. Shoot the first hole to increase\njackpot by 10M, or the second or third hole to increase by 5M. The\njackpot does not increase if you hit the 4th hole or send the ball\naround on the ramp.\n\nAfter locking the second ball, you have a plunger skill shot, where the\nsecond hole immediately gives you a 4-ball multiball, and the first and\nthird holes double the jackpot value, but don't yet give you multiball.\nIf you don't get the 4-ball multiball, you must lock a third ball. If you\ndo get 4-ball multiball, then you have another skill shot, to increase\nthe base jackpot value by 2x or 3x.\n\nOnce multiball starts, shoot the ramp to collect the jackpot. Every\nswitch increases the jackpot value by 200K. Scoring three jackpots\nlites the captive ball for a super jackpots, which is initially 250M, and\nincreased by 200K with every switch closure. If you collect the super\njackpot, the ramp is again lit for 3 more jackpots.\n\nIf all but 1 ball drains ending multiball, you have 12 seconds to restart\nit by shooting the right orbit. This time you are given a plunger skill\nshot for a 3-ball multiball. If you don't get that, you get a 2-ball\nmultiball. If you do get it, you have a chance to 2x or 3x the jackpot value\nas before.\n\nThe Coop's Cash and Bank Heist modes continue to run during multiball.\nYou cannot start multiball while in one of the other modes.\n\nNote in multiplayer games: Maverick does not do a very good job in\nadjusting the lock/skill shots for multiplayer games. If you lock ball 1\nand there are already two balls in the lock from a previous player, you\ndo not get the plunger skill shot to add 10M to the jackpot value. If\nyou lock ball 2 with two balls already in the lock, then you do not get\na chance at a 4-ball multiball, and you must lite and lock a third ball.\n\n7. Tournament Settings\nLauren Bell and mystery always gives awards in the same order.\n\nBlackjack programmed to win every second time.\n\nNo extra balls, no specials. Score 50M instead of an extra ball, and\n100M instead of a special.\n\n8. Scoring Level\nGrand Champion scores on Maverick typically range between 3B and\n6B. In tournament mode, it is expected that the top A division player\nmay score about 2B, and the average game be on the order of 500M-1B.\nIn the B and lower divisions, top scores will probably be about\n700M.\n\n9. Strategy Summary\nThe Lauren Bell mode is by far the most lucrative mode. Just keep\nshooting the orbits for 30 seconds, and you will wind up with 600+M\nplus extra balls and specials (or even more points in tournament\nmode).\n\nThe captive ball mode is worth a lot, but the captive ball is almost\nimpossible to hit, so you may be better off ignoring this mode.\n\nWinning poker hands can be worth a lot of points, especially once you\nhave a significant winning streak. Try to score perfect, because this\ntriples your score value. As an example, suppose winning streak is 10,\nyou raise, and you complete the bank perfect. That is worth 300M!\n\nShoot start mode on ball one, as this immediately wins you 5 poker\nchips and gives you an initial winning streak of 5.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Maverick", "possible_shots": "Drop Targets, Lauren Bell, Left and Right Orbits, Vertical Up-Kicker (VUK), Ramp (Stagecoach), Rollovers/Advance Bonus Multiplier, Pop Bumpers, Plunger Skill Shot, Captive ball", "manufacturer": "Sega", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/maverick.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Maverick", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Sorry.  Also, please feel\nfree to distribute this rulesheet in any form, just don't charge for it.\n\nNew Since Last Time\n\n Email address changed\n Major update for v1.0 software -- new quotes and rules\n \"Video Mode\" section updated\n \"Super Jets\" moved to new section\n\n\nOverview\nMedieval Madness is the long-awaited game from the Williams design team\nwhich created the hit \"Attack From Mars\".  In many ways (especially in\nplayfield layout), Medieval Madness is similar to Attack From Mars (AFM),\nbut it should not be classified as simply \"AFM on steroids\".  In fact,\nMedieval Madness is, for the most part, a slower-paced game than AFM.  It\nalso tends to be a \"friendlier\" game, with few shots which are drain risks.\n\nMedieval Madness also features the same sense of humor which made AFM that\nmuch more popular.  From the flying saucer on the backglass to the cursing\nmobster whose castle you seek to destroy, Madness is loaded with one-\nliners.  It's equally amazing how long some of the sound bites are.  Catch\nSir Psycho's maniacal laughter if you get the chance.\n\nFix Yer Trolls (for Sample games only)\nAn important note for those who are playing \"sample\" versions of Medieval\nMadness: there is a problem with the flaps for the Trolls.  They tend not to\nremain level with the playfield, as many have noticed.  A fix for this\nproblem is in place for the production version, and an update for the\nflaps is being shipped to distributors of sample games.  If you have this\nproblem with your local Medieval Madness, get the operator to contact the\nlocal Wms distributor.\n\nCredits: 7.\n\n Playfield Design: Brian Eddy\n Software: Lyman F. Sheats, Jr.\n Project Engineer: Robert C. Friesl\n Dot Matrix Animation: Adam Rhine\n Sound & Music: Dan \"Toasty\" Forden\n Artwork: Greg Freres and John Youssi\n Voices provided by Second City, Chicago\n\n\nand a cast of hundreds\n\n-- Got credits?  Mail me.\n\nPlayfield and Backglass Art\nBoth the playfield and glass are well done, in my opinion.  The backglass has\nan imposing king, holding up a sword... and surrounded by total chaos!  Many\njokes here and there on the backglass, including a sign which reads \"You must\nbe at least this tall to enter a siege\", invaders being doused with\nDragonade, a sneaker-wearing troll, and an unusual flying carpet.\n\nThe playfield art is a little more subdued (as it should be), but watch for\nsome unusual crowns, and a cannonball with a note on it.  Also check out the\nplastic above the catapult, and the jousters in the orbits.\n\nGoal\nDefeat the \"King of Payne\" and All the King's Men in a Battle for the\nKingdom.  Save damsels in distress, help the revolting peasants, launch\nfarm animals at castles, win jousting contests, kill wisecracking trolls.\nIn order to reach \"Battle for the Kingdom\" you must complete six tasks,\nmarked with blue lights on the playfield near the castle.  These six tasks\nare, from top to bottom:\n\n\n  Master of Trolls\n  Defender of Damsels\n  Patron of the Peasants\n  Catapult Ace\n  Joust Champion\n  Castle Crusher\n\n\nEach is described in a separate section below.\n\nPlayfield and Basic Rules\nIf you have Web access, you may want to direct your browser to the Wms web\nsite at http://www.pinball.wms.com/games/medieval -- the site has a superb\n\"Explore the Playfield\" feature, allowing you to see the MM playfield and\nthe function of all major shots.  Here, the playfield is described in full\ntextual glory.\n\n\nFlippers  Just the two!\n\nLeft Inlane / Outlane  Plenty of rubber in the area makes saves a little\neasier than on some games, but it is difficult to bounce the ball out\nof the inlane/outlane area.  Both the inlane and outlane light a letter\nin FIRE (like KHAN on \"Shadow\").  Completing FIRE adds 2 Bonus X.\nCompleting FIRE a set number of times (default 8) lights Video Mode\nin v1.0.\n\nCatapult  the most difficult shot in the game, to the far left side --\nabout the same position as the Drac shot in \"Taxi\" or the Hang-On shot\nin \"Dr. Who\"... more difficult than either, since there is no metal guide\nto help.  You are more likely to fall into the Catapult by a slingshot\nbounce than from a direct shot, in my opinion, although there is value in\na direct shot (see below).  The catapult fires the ball around the back of\nthe Castle and back to the left inlane.  Catapult advances toward the\nCatapult Slam! award and the \"Catapult Ace\" light.  See \"Catapult Ace\"\nsection for more.\n\nCatapult Standup  Shooting the Catapult shot directly from the right flipper\nmay hit the red standup target in the back of the Catapult area.  This\ntarget, in single-ball play, counts as a Catapult hit; since the ball\npromptly falls into the Catapult, you get credit for 2 Catapult shots.\nThis is especially useful in Royal Madness (see \"Royal Madness\"\nsection).\n\nLeft Joust Orbit  Fairly standard-position orbit.  Feeds bumpers during\nmultiballs, while Super Jets is lit, or when you score a Joust Victory --\notherwise screams around the orbit.  Shots advance toward the Joust\nVictory award and the \"Joust Champion\" light.  See \"Joust Champion\"\nsection for more.\n\nLeft (Peasant) Ramp  fairly long and wide ramp, feeds around the Castle and\nto the left inlane.  The ramp is \"split\" (looks broken with a six-inch\nlengthwise break), designed so that missed ramp shots feed directly to\nthe right flipper.  Certainly a good idea.  Shots advance toward the\nPeasant Revolt award and the \"Patron of the Peasants\" light.  See\n\"Patron of the Peasants\" section for more.\n\nCastle  the back left of the playfield is taken up by a large castle.  The\ncastle has two entrances (the Lock and the Main Entrance, described below)\nas well as a moat in front.  Balls which fall into the moat (either by a\nshort shot to the Lock or a shot to the closed Main Entrance) are ejected\ninto the Left Joust Orbit and return to the left flipper.\n\nLock  in the same position as the Lock ramp on \"Attack From Mars\", this is a\nshort shot, jumping over the moat and into the castle through a door\n(which the ball passes through easily).  Lock advances toward Castle\nMultiball, and collects Super Jackpots and Double Super Jackpots during\nCastle Multiball and Multiball Madness.  See \"Castle Multiball\" and\n\"Multiball Madness\" sections for more.\n\nLeft Troll  the Trolls are under the two doors in the playfield (very much\nlike the Trap Door from \"Theatre of Magic\").  The Left Troll blocks the\nLock shot when raised, although it is possible to bank a ball into the\nLock off the other Troll.  Trolls are active during the Trolls! round\nand during Troll Madness.  Destroying trolls advances toward the \"Master\nof Trolls\" light.  See \"Master of Trolls\" and \"Multiball Madness\" sections\nfor more.\n\nLeft Troll Standup  one of two standups to the left and right of the Main\nEntrance.  These standups light Trolls!, and can award Troll Bombs.  See\n\"Master of Trolls\" section for more.\n\nMain Entrance  The Main Entrance is straight up the middle of the game.\nSince the Castle is angled slightly, the Main Entrance is less of a drain\nhazard than the Saucer on AFM, though you should be prepared to slap save\nmany a ball.  One of the main goals of the game is to enter the Castle\nvia the Main Entrance.  To do this, you must go through three stages:\n\n Drawbridge up: a Drawbridge blocks the entrance; hit the Drawbridge\n(actually, the opto sensor in front of the moat) a number of times\nto lower it.  After hitting the Drawbridge, the ball will most\nlikely fall into the moat, and return via the left orbit.\n Drawbridge down, gate down: the ball may cross the Drawbridge, but\na gate keeps the ball from entering the Castle.  Hit the gate a\nnumber of times to raise it.\n Now, enter the castle to destroy it.  Destroying castles advances\ntoward the \"Castle Crusher\" light.\n\nSee \"Castle Crusher\" section for details on the number of hits.  You may\nshoot for the Main Entrance toward Castles at any time, including any\nMultiball.  Once a Castle is destroyed, you may immediately begin making\nprogress on the next Castle.  The Main Entrance also collects the Castle\nHurry-Up (see section for more).\n\nRight Troll Standup  To right of Main Entrance.  Advances toward lighting\nTrolls! and toward Troll Bombs.\n\nMerlin's Saucer  a standard saucer, a little to the left of the Stroke of\nLuck scoop from AFM.  The ball is kicked out of the saucer into the Right\nJoust Orbit, returning to the right flipper.  The saucer awards Merlin's\nMagic (a random award, see \"Merlin's Magic\" section) and starts Trolls!,\nMultiball Madness, and Royal Madness (when lit).  Extra balls are also\ncollected at this saucer.  It is possible to fall into the saucer from\nthe Jet Bumpers (far less likely than in AFM), where it will award Extra\nBall when lit, but nothing else.\n\nRight Troll  blocks Merlin's Saucer when raised during Trolls! or Troll\nMadness.  It is possible to hit Merlin's Saucer during Trolls! by banking\na ball off the Left Troll.  See \"Master of Trolls\" and \"Multiball\nMadness\" sections for more.\n\nRight (Dragon / Damsel) Ramp  The ramp is equipped with a diverter; most\nshots travel around a short ramp and back to the right inlane, but\nwhen lit, the shot travels straight to a hole in the back right of the\ncabinet (to \"save the damsel\"), then feeds the rollover lanes.  The ramp\nentrance is \"split\" (like the Left Ramp), so that missed ramp shots fall\nto the right flipper.  Ramp shots advance toward the Damsel Save award and\nthe \"Defender of Damsels\" light.  See \"Defender of Damsels\" section for\nmore.\n\nRight Joust Orbit  functions identically to the Left Joust Orbit with respect\nto feeds.  Shots advance to the Joust Victory award and the \"Joust\nChampion\" light.\n\nMerlin's Magic targets  3 red standups on the right.  Shoot all 3 to light\nMerlin's Magic if unlit.  Progress on the targets reset\nball-to-ball.\n\nRight Inlane / Outlane  spot FIRE for +2 Bonus X on either the inlane or\noutlane, advancing toward Video Mode.  Right drains seem to be more\ncommon than left drains.\n\nTop Rollovers  identical to AFM.  Two rollovers; complete both for +1 Bonus X.\nWarning: the rollovers are very hard to see!\n\nJet Bumpers  The bumpers score a marginal number of points, and advance toward\nSuper Jets.  See \"Super Jets\" section for more.\n\nAutoplunger  At start of ball, the normal plunge is to the rollover lanes,\nbut a Super Skill Shot exists (see \"Skill Shot\" section for more).  All\nplunged balls for Multiball travel to the rollover lanes.\n\nBall Launcher  red button, launches the ball... also activates Troll Bombs if\nyou have any (see \"Master of Trolls\" section for more).  Also may prove\nuseful during Video Mode.\n\n\n\nBall Saver\nThere is a brief (~5 sec.) ball saver (after the ball has exited the bumpers)\nat the start of each ball.  A ball saver is also in place at the start of\nany multiball, at the start of Royal Madness (which is not a multiball), and\nif you should complete Trolls! during Multiball Madness.\n\nSkill Shot\nThe normal Skill Shot is the same as it was on AFM: one rollover is flashing,\nroll over it.  50K + 10K each successive Skill Shot is yours, as is\n+5 Bonus X.  Miss, and you receive nothing but humble pie.\n\nOr: you may go for the Super Skill Shot.  Hold in the left flipper to enable\nthe Super Skill Shot.  As in AFM, the ball will plunge around the orbit to\nthe left flipper, and all shots will light (orbits, ramps, Catapult).\nCollect a shot to score 100K and start a Castle Hurry-Up (see \"Castle\nHurry-Up\" section).  Collecting the Super Skill Shot does NOT credit you\nwith finishing a set of shots (as it did on AFM); you only get credit for\nthe one shot toward any requirement.\n\nI usually take the Super Skill Shot for the quick points, but the regular\nSkill Shot is far safer, and may actually be worth more on a good ball.\n\nGame start quotes:\n\n \"It's a great day for jousting!\"\n \"I am Merlin, wise and old.  Listen up to what you're told.\"\n \"I am the King of Payne... welcome to my empire!\"\n \"... welcome to my domain!\"\n \"... my men will destroy you!\"\n \"... defend yourself!\"\n\n\nMerlin's Magic\nMerlin's Magic is lit to start the game, and collected at Merlin's Saucer.\nIt is relit by completing the 3-bank of standup targets on the right side.\n\nAwards include:\n\n\n Light Lock\n Award Lock\n Castle Multiball (typical award on ball 3 of a bad game)\n Light Trolls!\n Start Trolls! (typical award if you are about to start Multiball Madness)\n 3 Troll Bombs\n +5 Bonus X\n Hold Bonus X\n Light Extra Ball\n 1,000,000\n 500,000\n 250,000\n Start Hurry-Up\n ______ Madness (any of the 5 Madness rounds)\n Lower Drawbridge\n Destroy Castle Gate (!)\n Destroy Castle (!!)\n Video Mode (when enabled, will always be selected)\n Smack-A-Troll: the Trolls alternately pop up for 2 or 3 seconds, while a\ntimer counts down from 15.  Smack A Troll, and the timer resets (look for\na really cool animation).  Can be combined with any multiball.  Each Troll\nscores 300K and advances toward \"Master of Trolls\" (see section).  A very\nrare and very cool award.  The Trolls taunt you: \"Come on, hit me!\"  \"You\nca-a-a-n't hit me...\" and others.\n\n\nI believe this to be the complete list.\n\n\n \"It's not tragic, you have Merlin's Magic!\"\n \"Let's see what we've got here...\"\n \"Ah, here it is!\"\n\n\nVideo Mode\nVideo Mode is lit by (default) 8 completions of FIRE (on the inlanes and\noutlanes), and started in Merlin's Saucer.  Note: Video Mode is only\navailable in the release ROM (v1.0), not in the sample games' ROM (v0.5).\n\nThe video mode is called \"Save the Children\", and you must save 3 children\nfrom being captured by a large flock of buzzards (or some other evil bird).\nKill 30, and you win.  If one child is taken, you lose.  The mode plays a\nlot like Defender, with the buzzards trying to carry the babies off the top\nof the dot display.  You receive 100K for each buzzard killed, and a 1M\nbonus for completion.\n\nThere is a secret weapon available in the Video Mode.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to alter the Video Mode slightly, although\ndifficult.  See below if you're interested.\n\n\n  \"They took our children!\" (losing)\n\n\nSuper Jets\nThe game begins with a countdown: 50 jets for 1 million.  When 50 jets are\nhit, 1M is awarded, and Super Jets begins.  In Super Jets, the next 40 hits\nare worth a higher value (25K the first time).  Super Jets ends with the ball\nin play, or when the 40 hits are complete.  Completing 40 hits awards the\nsame value that was given before Super Jets began.\n\nThe next Super Jets requires 25 more hits than the last, awards raise by 1\nmillion, and Super Jets raise by 25K (effectively 1M over the 40 jets).  So\nthe second Super Jets takes 75 hits to reach, 2M bonus to start, 50K per jet,\n2M completion bonus.  Et cetera.\n\nWhen Super Jets is active, balls along the Joust loops will always feed the\nbumpers.  This is especially useful during Royal Madness, when ball control\nis a must.\n\nCastle Multiball\nCastle Multiball is started with shots to the Lock in the Castle.  For the\nfirst multiball, 3 shots are required; for successive multiballs, 6 shots\nare required.  Locks are virtual, like AFM; no balls are held by the machine.\n\nThere are 3 stages to multiball:\n\n\n In the first stage, either ramp is worth a Jackpot, base value 750K.  Five\nramp shots are required to light the Super Jackpot.\n The Super Jackpot is double the Jackpot value (base of 1.5M).  Super Jackpot\nis lit at the Lock shot.\n If you collect the Super Jackpot, both ramps, both orbits, Lock, and\nCatapult light for Super Jackpots.  The orbits are separate Super Jackpots.\n\n\nComplete all the Super Jackpots in the third stage, and you return to the\nfirst stage, with the Jackpot increased permanently by 250K (so Super Jackpots\nincrease by 500K).\n\nNeedless to say, Castle Multiball is very valuable: going through all 3 stages\nat the base value is worth a total of 14,250,000.  On default settings,\ncompleting the second stage (the first Super Jackpot) for the first time in a\ngame lights an Extra Ball at Merlin's Saucer.  Harder settings require\ncompletion of all three stages to light the EB, easier settings require the\ncompletion of only the first stage.\n\nMaster of Trolls / Trolls!\nTo get the \"Master of Trolls\" light you need to destroy a default of 10\nTrolls.  Trolls may be destroyed in the Trolls! round, Troll Madness, Royal\nMadness, or Smack-A-Troll.  Since you need to complete Trolls! to light\nTroll Madness, let's talk about Trolls! first.\n\nTo light Trolls! you must hit the Troll Standups (to either side of the Main\nEntrance) the required number of times (factory default 8).  Then, Trolls! is\nlit at Merlin's Saucer.  Hitting these standups an additional (default)\n8 times, either before or during Trolls!, will award 1 Troll Bomb.  You\ncan also light Trolls!, start Trolls!, or receive 3 Troll Bombs from a\n\"Merlin's Magic\" award (see section)\n\nDuring Trolls!, both Trolls pop up from under the playfield, and you must\nhit each (default) 3 times in 30 seconds.  (Settings vary from 2 to 4.)  You\nmay also use Troll Bombs by hitting the launch button; they count as a single\nhit on the Troll closest to death.  During Trolls! you may earn additional\nTroll Bombs by hitting the standups, or by banking a shot off a Troll and\ninto either the Lock or Merlin's Saucer.  A shot off one Troll into the Lock\nor Merlin's Saucer gives 1 Troll Bomb.  It is possible to cheat and earn\nTroll Bombs during Multiball by hitting the left Troll with a ball while a\nsecond ball lands in Merlin's Saucer from behind.  Note that although you\ntend to receive Troll Bombs during Trolls!, you can use them anytime\nTrolls are active (Multiball Madness, Royal Madness, Battle for the Kingdom).\nOften they may prove useful in these other rounds, so you may want to hold\non to your Bombs.\n\nNote that you need 3 shots to record 1 Troll Destroyed toward the\nrequirement.  You do not receive a Troll for each shot during Trolls!\n\nSuccessfully completing Trolls! awards 1M and lights Troll Madness at\nMerlin's Saucer, UNLESS...\n\n\n you already have Troll Madness lit, or have played Multiball Madness\nalready -- then completing Trolls! starts or extends a Castle Hurry-Up\n(see section)\n\n or, Trolls! was started at the same time as Multiball Madness, in which case\nTroll Madness is immediately added to the current Multiball Madness.  This\nis a very good thing to do -- all balls lost during Multiball Madness are\nreturned, a brief ball saver is given, and all Super Jackpots are worth an\nadditional 150K.\n\n\nIf Troll Madness is active during Multiball Madness, one of the two trolls\nwill pop up.  Hitting the Troll scores a Troll Super Jackpot worth half the\nSuper Jackpot (for the curious, this is 125K + 75K * # of active Madnesses)\nand the other pops up.  Each Troll killed here counts toward the\nrequirement.  You can use Troll Bombs during Multiball Madness, and may want\nto if you are close to the requirement.\n\nQuotes:\n\n lighting: \"Beware, Knight!\"  \"Trolls to fight!\"\n \"Mmm, human burgers.\"  \"Do we get fries with that?\"\n \"Trolls rule.\"  \"That's right.  Rule the Universe!\" \"You make us mad!\"\n \"We eat you for lunch.\"  \"With croutons and sprouts!\"\n \"Look, your shoe's untied!\"  \"Can't we all just get along?\"\n (bomb earned) \"You call that a shot?\"\n (killing one) \"He was weak.

The first three shots will\nreturn to the right inlane, and score 25K (Dragon Breath), 50K (Dragon Snack),\nand 75K (Dragon Death).\n\nThe fourth shot feeds to the window in the back right of the cabinet.  This\nshot scores 100K, gives 1 Damsel Save, and lights the Damsel Madness light\nif not already lit.  Sometimes scoring a Damsel Save will also start or extend\na Castle Hurry-Up (see section).  There are 5 damsels to save, each with her\nown set of (mostly) funny quotes.\n\nYou may also earn 1 Damsel Save during Royal Madness (see section).\n\n\n (opera singer) \"I'm getting hungry!\"\n \"I feel like singing!\"\n \"I'm all skin and bones up here!\"\n \"Please save me.  And don't forget the donuts!\"\n \"Yoo hoo, mein helmet has horns!\"\n Merlin: \"It's not over until the fat lady sings!\"\n (valley girl) \"Oh my god, this dragon is, like, totally grody!  Ew!\"\n \"This dragon is frizzing my hair!\"\n \"I'm, like, totally captured!\"\n \"Yoo hoo, up here...\"\n \"Uh, do you have a horse?\"\n \"Totally chivalrous!\"\n \"Ohmigod, you are, like, so cute!\"\n (saucy wench) \"That dragon is big!  But I bet you're bigger!\" (sheesh)\n \"Is that a sword in your pocket?\"\n \"I've got a reward for you...\"  \"Now, now, now!\"  \"Go, go, go!\"\n \"Take me, I'm yours.\" (boy oh boy)\n \"Not now, I have a headache!\" (oh darn)\n \"I always knew that someday my prince would come.\"\n (jewish goyl) \"This dragon is an animal!\"\n \"I need saving.\"\n \"You want me to fry?\"\n \"You got air conditioning up here?\"\n \"What am I, chopped liver?\"\n \"Toasty!\" (Dragon Snack)\n \"Fatality!\" (Dragon Death)\n \"What are you, some kind of prince or somethin'?\"\n \"Where have you been?\"\n (english woman) \"Up heah, in the towah!\"\n \"Mind the dragon, love.\"\n \"The rain in Spain... oh, just save me!\"\n \"Now's your chance.  Save me!\"\n \"Let's get married so we can get a divorce!\"\n\n\nPatron of the Peasants\nTo get the \"Patron of the Peasants\" light you need to score (default) 3\nPeasant Revolts.  To score a Peasant Revolt, shoot the left ramp 4 times.\nAll shots return to the left inlane, and score 25K (Rabble Rouser), 50K\n(Angry Mob), 75K (Ugly Riot), and 100K (Peasant Revolt).\n\nThe fourth shot also gives 1 Peasant Revolt, and lights Peasant Madness if\nnot already lit.  Sometimes scoring a Peasant Revolt will also start or\nextend a Castle Hurry-Up (see section).\n\nYou may also earn 1 Peasant Revolt during Royal Madness (see section).\n\nMost of the quotes here involve peasants complaining about what's been\ntaken from them.\n\n \"They've taken our shrubberies!\n ...shoes!\n ...pinball machines!\n ...cows!\n ...children!\n ...marshmallows!\n ...wives! (cheering)\n ... gruel! (cheering)\n ... livestock and treasured historical monuments!\"\n\nOthers:\n\n \"Grab a pitchfork and come with me!\"\n \"The castle burns!... Get the marshmallows! ...the weenies!\"\n \"I'll drink to that!\"\n \"Let's revolt, who's with me?\"\n \"Good work, men.\"\n\n\nCatapult Ace\nTo get the \"Catapult Ace\" light you need to score (default) 3 Catapult Slams.\nTo score a Catapult Slam, shoot the Catapult (or the Catapult Standup) 3\ntimes.  The first two shots score 50K (Catapult Wham) and 75K (Catapult Bam).\n\nThe third shot allows you to play the brief \"The Catapult\" game, where you\ncan choose which of 5 items to throw at the castle -- a duck, a cat, a cow, a\nbowling ball, and a skull head (not that Skull head, sorry, but sounds like\nit).  Before making your selection, you will be told the values of each\nitem (10K, 25K, 100K, 250K, 500K, seemingly random).  Flip both flippers to\nchoose -- it helps to remember the sequence of the items, or at least which\nitem comes before the one you want.  You only have about 5 seconds to choose,\nso be quick.  Successive tries tell you which items you have already fired,\nchallenging you to fire all 5 items.  If you manage to do this, enjoy!  Moo.\nThere is also a special bonus for continually hurling cows.\n\nThe third shot scores 100K (additional to the launching bonus), gives 1\nCatapult Slam, and lights Catapult Madness if not already lit.  Sometimes\nscoring a Catapult Slam will also start or extend a Castle Hurry-Up (see\nsection).\n\nKeep in mind that the Catapult Standup can make your life easier, reducing\n3 shots to 2.  The Catapult Standup won't count for the third shot, since\nyou'll fall into the Catapult immediately anyway.\n\nYou may also earn 1 Catapult Slam during Royal Madness (see section).\n\nNot many quotes here...\n\n \"Pull!\"\n\"Fire!\"\n\nand that's pretty much it.\n\nJoust Champion\nTo get the \"Joust Champion\" light you need to score (default) 3 Joust\nVictories.  To score a Joust Victory, shoot the orbits 3 times (either orbit\ncounts; the lights on each orbit show the same progress).  The first shot\nscores 50K (Joust Charge), and the second 75K (Joust Clash).  Both these\nshots will go all the way around the orbit, unless Super Jets is active.\n\nThe third shot awards 100K and feeds the bumpers.  It also gives 1 Joust\nVictory, and lights Joust Madness if not already lit.  Sometimes scoring a\nJoust Victory will also start or extend a Castle Hurry-Up (see section).\n\nYou may also earn 1 Joust Victory during Royal Madness (see section).\n\n\n \"Oh my, he breaks the lance!\"\n \"That had to hurt!\"\n \"Gory but good!\"\n Sir Missalot, Sir Loin of Beef, Sir Moovenstein (?), Sir Lanceless\n \"Sir _______ charges up the center lane!\" (jeeez)\n \"Sir _______, with the shish kebob!\"\n \"Oh, Sir _______ is down!\"\n \"Sir _______, with the lance!  Boom shaka laka!\" (Lanceless :)\n\n\nCastle Hurry-Up\nThe rule about Castle Hurry-Ups is somewhat confusing.  If you've just\ncompleted Damsel Save, Catapult Slam, Peasant Revolt, Joust Victory, or\nTrolls! (in single-ball play), and this completion lights the corresponding\nMadness for Multiball Madness (i.e., sets the light to flashing), then this\ncompletion will NOT light or extend a Castle Hurry-Up.  Otherwise, it will.\nIn other words:\n\n\n If you haven't played Multiball Madness yet, you won't get a Castle Hurry-\nUp unless you repeat something you've already completed.\n If you have played Multiball Madness (but not yet Royal Madness), you get\na Castle Hurry-Up every time.\n Trolls! won't give you a Castle Hurry-Up during Multiball Madness.\n\n\nYou may also start Castle Hurry-Up via a Super Skill Shot or Merlin's Magic\naward.\n\nThe Castle Hurry-Up value starts at 1M and decreases rather quickly, to a\nminimum of 250K.  Collect the Hurry-Up at the Main Entrance, regardless of\nthe state of the current Castle.\n\nIf you complete another row of lights which would normally start a Castle\nHurry-Up while one is running, the Hurry-Up resets to a higher value.  The\nsecond completion adds 2M to the Hurry-Up value, then each successive\ncompletion adds 500K more than the last.  So the Hurry-Up is worth 3M with\ntwo, 5.5M with 3, 8.5M with 4, 12M with 5, et cetera.  If there is a limit,\nit is at least 25 million.  The Hurry-Up counts down at the same speed, so\nthere is no need to worry about it timing out if you have at least a double\ngoing.\n\nEach Hurry-Up collected is counted (so a 3M Hurry-Up counts as two), and\n(default) 10 Hurry-Ups lights Extra Ball at Merlin's Saucer.  A second EB\nis available at (yeesh) 40 Hurry-Ups.\n\nMerlin congratulates you on completing a Hurry-Up.\n\n \"Magnificent!\"\n \"Beautiful!\"\n \"What skill!\"\n \"You did it!\"\n \"Good, good, good...\"\n\n\nCastle Crusher\nTo get the \"Castle Crusher\" light, you must destroy the 6 Castles of the King\nof Payne and All The King's Men: Sir Howard Hurtz (a mobster), Francois de\nGrimm (a Frenchman), the Earl of Ego (a narcissist), the Duke of Bourbon (a\ndrunk), and Sir Psycho (a... uh, psycho).  The order in which you go after\nthe King's Men in random, but the King of Payne is always last (similar to\nthe cities in AFM).\n\nTo destroy the Nth Castle, you will need to do the following:\n\n\n hit the Drawbridge N times to lower it (1 for the first, 6 for the King)\n hit the lowered Gate N+1 times to raise it (2 for the first, 7 for the King)\nEach hit to the lowered Gate scores 200K * Castle # for the first 5 Castles,\nand 1M per hit for the King's Castle.\n enter the Castle to destroy it (watch for the cool effect)\nDestroying a Castle scores 2M * Castle # for the first 5 Castles, 20M for\nthe King's Castle.\n\n\nAs noted above, there isn't anything special about the King of Payne's Castle\nexcept that it is more difficult than the others, and his taunts are a little\nmore direct...\n\nDestroying all 6 Castles is worth at least 71 million (21 million in Gate\nhits and 50 million in bonuses for destroying Castles), so it's a decent way\nto get a replay or high score if you work at it above all else.  Multiballs\ncan help, and remember that the Main Entrance is a much safer shot than\nAFM's saucer.\n\nIf you complete Castle Crusher before the other 5 lights, the Drawbridge will\nremain open but the Gate will come back down.  Each Gate hit scores 750K;\nafter quite a few (7?), the Gate opens for a shot at the \"Castle Bonus\" of\n7.5M.  The animation shows a Castle being destroyed, but this doesn't make any\nprogress toward reaching the King a second time.  (Does it count toward the\nnumber of Castles destroyed?)  Battle for the Kingdom will only light during\nsingle-ball play, so if you destroy the King's Castle during a multiball,\nyou'll have to wait a bit.  Oh, poor you.\n\nDestroying a certain number of Castles (default is 2) lights an Extra Ball\nat Merlin's Saucer.\n\n\n (general) King: \"You will never defeat ________!\"\n King, after Castle destruction: \"Eh, I never liked that guy anyway.\"\n\n\n\n \"I'm the Duke of Bourbon...

How about that!\n\nTo start Multiball Madness, shoot Merlin's Saucer when at least one of the\nfive Madness lights is flashing.  How to get each light:\n\n\n Troll Madness: finish Trolls!\n Damsel Madness: score Damsel Save\n Peasant Madness: score Peasant Revolt\n Catapult Madness: score Catapult Slam\n Joust Madness: score Joust Victory\n\n\nMadnesses may also be awarded by Merlin's Magic.  It seems to only offer this\nto you when Multiball Madness is about to begin, which is probably for the\nbetter.\n\nIt is therefore easy to light Multiball Madness.  However, the more Madness\nlights you have flashing going into the round, the better.  Why?\n\n\n The shots corresponding to each flashing light will be lit for Super\nJackpot instead of Jackpot.\n The value of the Jackpot and Super Jackpot increases with each Madness lit.\n The number of balls in Multiball Madness is determined by the number of\nMadness rounds lit:\n\n 1 Madness light -- 2 balls\n 2-4 Madness lights -- 3 balls\n 5 Madness lights -- 4 balls and a loud introduction (Sunday!  Sunday!)\n\n\n\nScoring in Multiball Madness is as follows:\n\n    Jackpots in Multiball Madness are worth 75K + 25K * (# Madnesses lit) --\nminimum 100K, maximum 175K.\n    Super Jackpots are worth 250K + 150K * (# Madnesses lit) -- a minimum of\n400K and a maximum of 1M.\n    If Troll Madness is active, the raised Troll is worth a \"Troll Super\nJackpot\", worth half the Super Jackpot.\n    The Lock shot is worth a Double Super Jackpot, up to 2M.\n\n\nThe Catapult Standup awards the associated Catapult award; so, in effect,\nthere is more than one way to score a Double Super Jackpot.\n\nImportant note: if Trolls! begins at the start of Multiball Madness (and it\noften will), completing Trolls! will instantly add Troll Madness to the\nongoing multiball, and act as if it had just started (you'll hear the game\nintroduce Troll Madness).  All lost balls are returned (and, depending, you\nmay get more balls), the ball saver comes back on, and the Super Jackpot\nvalue increases.\n\nLike AFM's Total Annihilation, watch the display at the end of Multiball\nMadness to find out how you did.  There is a Master of Madness award for the\nhighest-scoring Multiball Madness round.  If the display reads \"Multiball\nMadness Champion\" instead of \"Multiball Madness Total\", well, congratulations.\n\nOnce you have played Multiball Madness, you may not play it again until after\nyou have played Royal Madness (see below) by lighting all 5 Madness lights.\nSince you can only play Multiball Madness once, it makes sense to wait until\nyou have as many Madness lights flashing as possible, and to limit the amount\nof time during which only one Madness light is flashing.  Plan your shots\naccordingly!\n\n(100,000 is a jackpot now?  Man.)\n\nRoyal Madness\nRoyal Madness is lit at Merlin's Saucer when you have lit all 5 of the\nMadness lights, and have already played Multiball Madness.  Royal Madness is\na single-ball round where the goal is to make 10 shots (2 to each ramp, 2 to\nthe orbits, 2 to the Catapult, and 1 to each Troll) before a 20-second timer\nruns out.  If you manage to make all 10 shots, you are immediately rewarded\nwith an Extra Ball (or 15 million, depending on settings).\n\nFor some reason, Royal Madness gives the player a brief ball saver, even\nthough only one ball is in play.  Go figure.  Take advantage by aiming for\nthe most difficult shot right away, the Catapult.\n\nThe timer is set to 20 seconds; making any shot resets the timer (and you'll\nhear a warning at 10 seconds, and a countdown from 5 seconds left).\nDuring Royal Madness, the Lock shot remains lit; it will award one shot of the\n10, starting with the Catapult.  The Catapult Standup also counts as a shot to\nthe Catapult, so it is possible to finish the difficult Catapult requirement\nwith one solid shot.\n\nThe first shot of the 2 required (or the first Troll) scores 200K and awards\n1 of whatever award is given for completing that shot in regular play\n(1 Catapult Slam, etc.).  The second shot awards a Jackpot worth 1.5M + 250K\nfor each additional Royal Madness (second time around is 1.75M, etc.).\nSample games base this Jackpot on your performance during Multiball Madness,\napproximately one-tenth of your total in the round.  The second Troll counts\ntoward your total of Trolls destroyed.\n\nOrbit shots will careen back around if Super Jets isn't running, so watch out!\n\nNote that you can use Troll Bombs during Royal Madness.  Although it is\nrelatively easy to hit the Trolls anyway, you may want to keep this in mind\nif you have 2 seconds left on the clock and need a shot, or the Troll is the\nfinal shot of Royal Madness (which happens on occasion).\n\nRoyal Madness ends when you finish the 10 shots and collect the Extra Ball,\nwhen you drain the ball, or when time runs out (there is a brief grace period,\nas always).  Whatever happens, the process of setting up Multiball Madness\nbegins anew.\n\nBattle for the Kingdom\n(potential spoiler)\n\n\n  \"The Reign of Payne is at an end.  He never wanted to be your friend!\"\n  \"The King of Payne has had his way.  Now it's time for him to pay!\" (?)\n\n\nIf all 6 blue lights (Master of Trolls, Defender of Damsels, Patron of the\nPeasants, Catapult Ace, Joust Champion, and Castle Crusher) have been lit,\nBattle for the Kingdom is lit at the Main Entrance.  You can only start BfK\nin single-ball play.\n\nBfK is a 4-ball multiball with about a 15 second ball saver to start.\nYou must hit each of the following shots (all are lit to start):\n\nCatapult, both ramps, both orbits (separately), Lock.\n\nEach of these shots awards a 2.5M Battle Jackpot.\n\nIf all shots are completed, the lowest blue light will flash; this is your\ncue to start pounding away at the Castle (the Gate will be down).  Each shot\nto the Gate awards a 5M Battle Jackpot and advances the blue lights.  Also\nat this time, the Trolls pop up, limiting your angle on the Gate.  The only\nway they'll go down is with a Troll Bomb, so hopefully you saved two.  If\nnot, remind yourself that the Trolls save more drains than they cause.\n\nAfter 6 shots, the white Battle for the Kingdom light will flash.  Hit the\nGate once more for another 5M.  The gate will raise, and the red arrow toward\nthe Main Entrance will flash.\n\nI wonder what you're supposed to do next.  Do it, and you will have won the\nBattle for the Kingdom and a 50 million bonus!  And pat yourself on the\nback, because it's quite hard, much harder than Rule the Universe!  Enjoy\nthe celebration.\n\nYou also may want to enjoy the Victory Laps, which light on all major shots.\nEach Victory Lap scores a base of 500K, and flashes all major shots for an\nUltra Combo.  The Ultra Combo scores double the Victory Lap value, and adds\n20K to it.  So the shots go 500K, 1M, 1.04M, 1.08M, etc.  When the Ultra\nCombos time out, you just have to get another Victory Lap.  I think it is\npossible to play out all Victory Laps, but I have not yet played enough to\nknow.  The Victory Lap / Ultra Combo value continues to increase throughout\nthe ball, to no known maximum.\n\nWhen BfK ends, everything resets.  In order to make it to BfK a second time,\nyou will need an additional 10 Trolls, an additional 3 each of Damsel\nSave, Peasant Revolt, Catapult Slam, and Joust Victory, and all 6 Castles\na second time.\n\nNote for sample games: you only need a total of 20 Trolls and 6 of each\nrequirement (besides the Castles) to light BfK a second time, which can be\neasier.  Additionally, the Trolls are part of the first stage of BfK, so\n8 shots are required before the Castle becomes the target.\n\nFurther completions of BfK are worth 50M more than the last, a very hefty\nsum on this game.  The Victory Lap value resets after the ball.\n\nEnd-of-ball Bonus\nThe only bonus is a switch bonus, which is added to throughout the ball.  A\nlengthy ball can advance this bonus to over 1M; with a high bonus\nmultiplier, the total bonus can be over 50-60 million.  I do not know the\nmaximum bonus multiplier, but it is likely the same as AFM's (250x).  I have\nheard of players clearing 100x.\n\nExtra Balls\nExtra Balls can be lit by:\n\n\n Destroying Castles (default 2)\n Super Jackpot in Castle Multiball\n 10 and 40 Hurry-Ups\n Merlin's Magic random award\n\n\nLit Extra Balls are collected at Merlin's Saucer, and remain lit between\nballs.  Completing Royal Madness will immediately award an Extra Ball.\n\nDefault behavior is to allow 4 extra balls per ball in play, but this can\nbe changed.  MM allows a limit on the number of extra balls that a player\nmay receive on any \"ball\" (in other words, only 1 EB allowed on Ball 1, one\non Ball 2, and one on Ball 3).\n\nCows and Other Easter Eggs\nCows abound.  A cow on the backglass.  Hurl a cow at the Castle in the\nCatapult Video Mode.  The peasants complain that the King has \"taken our\ncows!\"  The default Grand Champion (and Multiball Madness Champ) initials\nare MOO!\n\nLook for Barnyard Madness.  Think of something difficult that the game is\nchallenging you to do... complete it and you will have access to Barnyard\nMadness.  Chickens!  Horses!  Pigs!  Oh my!\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to change the critters being saved in Video\nMode.  Throw cows!  Lots of cows!\n\nEntering Initials\nBesides the regular high score board (2 credits for Grand Champion, 1 credit\nfor High Scores 1-4), Medieval Madness allows you to enter your initials for:\n\n\n Master of Madness: highest total score in one Multiball Madness\n Castle Crusher: most Castles destroyed\n Joust Champion: most Joust Victories\n Defender of Damsels: most Damsels saved\n Catapult Ace: most Catapult Slams\n Patron of the Peasants: most Peasant Revolts\n Troll Avenger: highest Troll total in game\n\n\nYou also get to enter your initials for completing Battle for the Kingdom\n(like AFM's Ruler of the Universe).  The game keeps track of how many times\nyou've become King, and when it happened.  The last four crowned Kings are\ndisplayed, numbered according to how many times BfK has been completed on\nthe machine.\n\nNone of these awards an additional credit, but well worth shooting for.\n\nOn sample games, initials are only entered for high score, Master of Madness,\nand Master of Trolls (renamed Troll Avenger).\n\nNotes on Strategy\nTry to get as many of the Madnesses lit for Multiball Madness before\nstarting it.  If you are stuck with a lousy Multiball Madness, you may want\nto shoot for the Castle instead.  Those Gate hits are worth a lot!  In fact,\nthe average value of a shot to the Castle is worth more than the average\nvalue of a shot during almost all Multiball Madnesses.  On the King's Castle,\nthe 14 shots award a total of 27 million points, much better than taking the\n1M Super Jackpots.\n\nIf Multiball Madness becomes lit, be sure to avoid Merlin's Saucer until you\nhave enough Madnesses lit that it becomes worthwhile.  The ramps are the\neasiest to complete, although the orbit is also fairly easy.\n\nIf you've got an Extra Ball lit at Merlin's Saucer and a lousy Multiball\nMadness lit there as well, you've got a tough decision to make.  Don't forget\nthat you can still get VERY good points out of Multiball Madness by\nconcentrating instead on the Castle.  To get the EB, you might also try\nfeeding the bumpers via the orbits or the Damsel ramp.\n\nStarting Trolls! along with Multiball Madness is one of the best things you\ncan do.  It is much easier to finish Trolls! with 2 or 3 balls than with 1,\nand the benefits for finishing Trolls! during the multiball outweigh the\nbenefit of starting the multiball with Troll Madness.  You also don't have\nto worry about losing the ball while playing Trolls!.\n\nBe sure to get as many of the bonuses out of Royal Madness as you can,\nsince this makes getting to BfK that much easier.\n\nDon't forget about the Castles!  Since you're much less likely to complete\nor advance toward a Castle by luck or balls bouncing around during a\nmultiball, you really have to concentrate on Castles often if you want to\nget through them all (especially the later Castles which require lots of\nhits).  As on AFM, a good tactic is to start multiball (Castle Multiball is\nmuch easier to start) and bang at the Castle all the way through.  Since you\ncan move right along after destroying a Castle, a good multiball can net you\n2 or even 3 Castles.  I would recommend only playing out Castle Multiball if\nyou're looking for an extra ball.\n\nDuring Multiball Madness, both orbits feed the bumpers, as will the right\nramp if lit for Super Jackpot.  This is an excellent way of \"parking\" one or\nmore balls so you can get a clean shot at a Double Super Jackpot.  Note that\nif Troll Madness is running, the Left Troll blocks this shot!  Get rid of\nthe Troll right away when this happens (you may even want to use a Troll Bomb\nif you're desperate).\n\nMy personal best is 1.11 billion, on a game with unlimited extra balls.  On\na game with limited extra balls (maximum 1 per ball, 3 for the game) my best\nis 350 million.  I would expect 200 million to be a very good competition\nscore.\n\nHelp!\nI would like to get the complete list of the game's quotes.  If you know a\nquote which you think belongs here, email me.

It's set for 5 balls per\ngame, $1 per credit--or 6 credits for $5.  No extra ball buy-in.\n\n>Playfield\n\n>Huge castle with moat in upper middle of the playfield\n\n     That moat is important; it can be your friend as well as your enemy.\nThe castle lane points just about SDTM, so shooting at it has certain\ninherent hazards. :-)  If the drawbridge is up, it can be to your benefit to\nshoot at the castle softly, so that the ball bounces weakly off the bridge\nand falls safely into the moat.  Of course, once the bridge drops and you're\nworking on the gate, it's every warrior for himself...\n     The two troll standups (as opposed to the troll figures themselves) are\non either side of the lane leading to the castle.\n\n>Swinging door on left side of the castle (multiball start)\n\n     This is a much narrower lane than the main castle gate, so it's a\ndifficult shot.  But unlike the castle gate itself, it's a safe shot if you\nmake it; whether the ball goes through the door or not, it winds up in the\nmoat.\n\n>Left ramp\n\n     A very long ramp, but rather forgiving; the ball doesn't have to get\nvery far before it'll go the rest of the way on its own.\n\n>Dragon/Tower (right) ramp with upper level/diverter on right to rescue the\n>damsel-in-distress from the tower.\n\n     A shorter ramp, but much steeper and less forgiving to shoot; it's\neasy for the ball to lose steam and fall back down the ramp.\n\n>Hidden trolls that pop up from the middle of the playfield\n\n     And believe it or not, hitting these things seems to be a reasonably\nsafe shot.  (A useful combo: Bouncing a shot off the left troll and into the\ncenter saucer awards a Troll Bomb--usable for killing trolls, just like the\nMartian Bombs in AFM.  You can also get Troll Bombs from Merlin's Magic, or\nfrom hitting the troll standups enough times with Trolls! already lit.)\n\n>\"Merlin Magic\" saucer in right front of drawbridge awards random award on DMD\n\n     Starts the game lit; relit by hitting the three star targets at the lower\nright of the playfield.\n\n>Catapult launch on the far left that feed two rollover lanes at top right,\n>with pop bumpers below\n\n     There's a bit of confusion here.  The catapult lane doesn't feed the\nrollovers at the top; the orbit shots feed those under certain circumstances.\nBalls launched from the catapult wind up on the left ramp's path, and lead\nback to the left inlane.\n     The catapult shot is one of the most dangerous shots on the playfield;\nit's a narrow lane, and it's so close to the flippers that the ball will be\ncoming back to you in a very very big hurry if you miss the wrong way.\n     By the way, notice the target at the top of the catapult lane.  If you\nshoot the ball up the lane hard enough (so it hits the target, rather than\njust weakly falling into the catapult), it counts as two catapult hits; this\nis useful as heck during Royal Madness.\n\n>Left and right loops (complete three times to light multiball)\n\n     A little bit of confusion here; see below.\n     (The left and right orbit shots are interchangable; the game is counting\ntotal orbit shots, not counting each orbit separately.)\n\n>\"FIRE\" rollovers in the in/outlanes.\n\n     Completing \"FIRE\" gives you +2 bonus X.  (There's no extra ball here,\nas there was on the Stroke of Luck lights in AFM; they moved that to the\nCastle Hurryups.)\n\n>Mode start saucer on the right (where the scoop in AFM was)\n\n     Extra balls are lit here as well.\n\n>\"Return to Battle\" Ballsaver during the first few seconds. Draining in an\n>outlane autoplunges a new ball as soon as the outlane switch is triggered,\n>so it's back in play pretty quickly.\n\n     You also get a few seconds of ballsaver at the start of Multiballs, and\nat the start of Royal Madness.  (Get that catapult shot in early, kids!)\n\n>\"Missed Ramp Save\" feature\n>Both ramps \"look broken\" with a gap at the bottom of the ramp, split all the\n>way up.\n\n>\"The \"split\" that you noticed is actually a very player friendly feature.\n>There is actually a long [triangular] piece of plastic mounted on top of a\n>normal flat bottom ramp. This plastic prevents roll backs from the ramps\n>from going straight down the middle. [It] looks a little odd but it was a\n>little tweak ... added after playing the first prototypes. It feels a lot\n>nicer and makes the game more fun to play.\"\n\n     And the designers really succeeded well in this regard.  Despite the\ncastle shot and the catapult, MM really gives me a feeling of \"if the ball\ndrains it's your own damn fault.\"\n\n>Game Play\n\n>Destroy the castle\n>Hit the moat to lower the drawbridge so you can launch pinballs to destroy\n>the castle by launching three \"cannonballs\" into the castle. Destroying the\n>castle is very cool. (There are several castle inhabitants that taunt you\n>while working on this). With each hit on the castle, there is a coordinated\n>\"cannonball landing\" sequence on the DMD with wonderful sound effects. When\n>you make the third shot, the castle is \"destroyed\" - the castle shakes,\n>the towers fall and you know it's gone ...\n\n     This is a great playfield toy; fun to watch, yet of absolutely no\nconsequence to the game if it breaks.\n     To describe the mechanism a little more closely:  The castle is\nprotected by a drawbridge and a gate.  Hitting the drawbridge X times (1 time\nfor the first castle, 2 for the second, etc.), lowers it and exposes the gate.\nHitting the gate three times opens it; hitting the inside of the castle once\ndestroys it.\n     If this sounds suspiciously like saving cities in AFM, it is.  (The sixth\ncastle, \"The King of Payne\", is always last, like the Attack Mars round in AFM;\nI've seen the King lit, but I've never seen anyone actually get far enough\ninto it to see whether the rules are different from the other castles.)\n     Destroying the third castle lights an extra ball.\n     One important difference between MM and AFM:  In MM, during a Multiball,\nyou can finish off one castle and start on the next.\n\n\n>Complete each ramp or loop 3 times to light a multiball mode.\n>These modes can be overlapped. All ramps, loops, multiball start and\n>catapult are then lit for jackpots.\n\n     To give a bit more detail here:  The left ramp has four Peasant lights;\nthe right has four Dragon lights--so you have to hit a ramp four times to\nfinish it off.  The catapult lane has three Catapult lights; but you can do\nit in two shots, if you hit that target at the top of the lane at least once.\nThe orbits, collectively, have three Joust lights.\n     The rules for how to start Multiball Madness are a teensy bit confusing.\nThe description makes it sound I play through five Madness rounds before\narriving at Royal Madness, but I don't; I only play one--but the rules for\nthe one I play depend on what I do before starting it.\n     Each set of ramp/orbit/catapult lights has a corresponding Madness light\nat the center hole; the Trolls have one as well.  The least confusing way I\ncan come up with to describe how it works is to give an example.  Let's say\nthat I finish off the Peasant ramp.  The Peasant Madness light will start\nflashing at the center hole; if I hit that hole now, it'll start Peasant\nMadness.  But I don't want to do that just yet, for reasons that I hope will\nbecome clear in a moment.  So I finish up the Catapult instead; so the\nCatapult Madness light starts flashing too.  Now I finish the Peasant ramp\nagain.  Since Peasant Madness is already lit, the game instead gives me a\nCastle Hurry-up; I'll get to that in a second.  I hit the center hole,\nand Multiball Madness starts.\n     Multiball Madness is a two-ball multiball if you only have one\nMadness light flashing going in, a four-ball multiball if you have all five\n(this also gives you a wonderful, monster-truck-rallyish variant of the\n\"MULTIBALL MADNESS!\" quote), or a three-ball if you have something in between.\nMost of the major shots--the ramps, the orbits, the catapult--are lit for\nJackpots.  The shots that I'd already lit the Madness lights for--so the\nCatapult and the Peasant ramp, in this case--are lit for Super Jackpots\ninstead.  The small left door on the Castle is good for Double Super Jackpots;\nthe Castle itself just plays normally, and the scoop isn't lit for anything.\nThe value of the Jackpots and Super Jackpots depends on how many Madness\nlights you had flashing going in.  If you start Madness with just a single\nlight, you get a paltry 100K for Jackpots and 200K for Super J's; the\nvalues gradually rise with additional lights, reaching 1M for Super Jackpots\nwith all the Madnesses lit.  (This represents a _lot_ of points on this game;\nthe GC on the local machine is 215M.)\n     Jim describes the way the Trolls! modes work below.  If they sound a lot\nlike Martian Attack and Martian Multiball, you're right.  If you suspect that\nmeans that they can be combined with Multiball Madness, you're right again.\nIf you actually complete the Trolls! round before starting a Multiball\nMadness, the Troll Madness light starts flashing.  You can also have the\nTrolls! mode running when you hit the scoop to start Madness; in that case,\nthe Trolls! mode keeps running along with the Madness, and if you complete\nTrolls! before Madness ends, Troll Madness gets added on to the Madness\nalready in progress--which gives you a fresh set of balls for your multiball\nif you've lost any, a fresh few seconds of ballsaver, and the higher values\nfor the rest of your Jackpot and Super Jackpot shots.  This is very cool.\n(I suspect the designers agree, because I've noticed that when you get the\nother four Madnesses flashing, get Merlin's Magic lit as well, then hit the\ncenter hole, \"START TROLLS!\" seems to be an awfully popular award...)\n     (No, you can't start Madnesses other than the Trolls this way; shots\nto ramps/orbits/catapults during Madness don't count towards finishing those\nshots--they just give you Jackpots or Super Jackpots.)\n     So playing Madness effectively is somewhat similar to playing Dracula\neffectively.  In Dracula, you try to set things up so that you have all\nthe multiballs nearly ready to start, then start them all as fast as you\ncan.  In this game, you can't add new Madnesses in mid-Multiball this way,\nso you try to avoid starting Madness while you get as many of the Madness\nlights lit as you can, then hit the center hole to start the carnage.)\n     Anyway, once Multiball Madness finishes, you're now just trying to\nfinish up the shots you didn't finish up before (so the Dragon, the Joust\nand the Trolls, in this case).  The Madness lights are no longer flashing;\nthey're lit solidly instead.  Finishing up a shot lights the Madness light\nfor that shot if it wasn't lit before, and starts a Castle Hurry-up in any\ncase.\n     When you get all five Madness lights lit (which you can do by starting\nMultiball Madness with all five flashing, or by cleaning up afterwards), Royal\nMadness lights at the center hole.  Royal Madness is an intense round--and\nno, it's not another multiball.  Two lights are lit at each ramp, at the\norbits, and at the Catapult; the Trolls pop up as well.  The object is to\nclear all these lights, and slay the Trolls.  The first time you hit a lit\nshot, one light goes out, and you get 250K.  (This also counts as finishing\nthat shot once, for the purpose of the wizard mode--more on that later.)\nThe second time, the other light goes out, and you get a 750K Jackpot.\n(Remember that a solid hit to that Catapult lane will give you credit for\nboth Catapult shots.)  Each Troll only requires one hit to slay; the first\nTroll down gives 250K, the second 750K.  (And yes, those Troll Bombs work\nhere.)  There's a 20-second timer for all this--pause for the cries of\nBullshit!\" to die down--but that timer resets every time you successfully\nmake a shot.  (And there's about a five-second grace period when the timer\nruns out.)\n     Clearing all the lights and slaying both trolls, without losing the ball\nand without running out of time, awards an extra ball.\n     Two strategy hints here: go for the Catapult first (while the ballsaver\nis still lit), and consider saving at least one troll if possible (since\nhitting a troll is an easy way to reset the timer if you're having trouble\nmaking a shot).\n     Once the mode is over one way or the other, the Madness lights clear,\nand you start all over again.\n\n     Oh, yes, the Castle Hurryups:  Like I said, you get one of those when\nyou finish a shot, but you've already lit that shot for Madness, or you've\nalready played Madness (and haven't played Royal Madness yet to reset\neverything).  The main castle gate lights; the value starts at 100K and\ncounts down.  As in AFM, if you finish off another shot with a Hurryup already\nrunning, the value escalates to 300K, then to 600K, and so on.  But there's\none thing to bear in mind here:  You get an extra ball for 10 completed\nHurryups.  So combining a bunch of them may not be the best idea, since no\nmatter how many you combine, they still only count as one towards that\nextra ball.\n\n>   Complete all multiball modes to start Royal madness.\n>   Then every multiball mode must be completed 3 times to start wizard mode.\n\n    Not quite correct; see below.\n\n>   Regular (Castle) multiball started by \"locking\" three balls.\n>   Jackpots are the ramps.

The catapult rapidly cycles through them (hit\nthe flipper buttons to select), and each one has a different value, up to\n500K.  In addition, I believe that launching three different items during\nthe game gives an award (though I don't remember whether it was a lit\nextra ball or just some big points).\n\n>   Two different troll modes\n>   TROLLS !\n>   Hit the two yellow targets in the middle of the game to light TROLLS! on\n>the right eject.

This lights troll multiball madness.\n\n     One troll blocks the small castle door; the other blocks the center\nhole.  This makes it somewhat tricky to start Madness with Trolls! running;\nyou have to either slay the right troll first, or bounce a shot off the left\ntroll.  (One time, I managed to bank a ball off both trolls and in there;\nI seem to recall that the game actually recognized this as a different combo\nfrom the basic troll-to-hole combo, and gave me 3 Troll Bombs instead of 1...)\n\n>   Troll Multiball Madness\n>   The trolls alternate left and right.

I'm medicated!\"), Sir Francois of\nsomething-I-can't-remember (\"I will get medieval on your derriere!\"), and\nfinally the King of Payne.\n     The wizard mode--Battle for the Kingdom--is something else again;\nyour progress toward that is tracked by blue lights near the castle.\nYou have to finish each ramp, the orbits, and the Catapult three times each.\n(Again, the first shot to each of these during Royal Madness counts as\nfinishing the shot once, so this isn't really that hard at all.)  You also\nhave to kill your quota of trolls, and--by far the most difficult one--\ndestroy all six castles.

In order to do this, you have to light up the six blue\ndots on the playfield, they dots are located at the castle\ndrawbridge entrance. The six blue dots are:\n\n\nMaster of Trolls\nDefender of Damsels\nPatron of the Peasants\nCatapult Ace\nJoust Champion\nCastle Crusher\n\n\nWe'll get to these blue dots in a moment.\nThe playfield layout, as you can see in the picture above,\nhas orbits (O) on both sides, ramps (R) on both sides, and a\njump (J) over the moat into the castle, the castle drawbridge\n(D), and the saucer (S). From left to right, the order is:\nO R J D S R O\n^ ^\nThe little arrows indicate Troll switches (mentioned\nlater).\nOn the lower right side of the playfield are three standup\ntargets with stars. Hitting all of them lights Merlin's Magic\n(described later). In the inlanes and outlanes are fireballs,\nwith the letters \"F\", \"I\", \"R\".\nand \"E\". I have not yet figured out what filling\nthem in does, but I'm sure it's for good measure.\nThe saucer does many things:\n\nTrolls!\nMerlin's Magic\nExtra Ball\nMadness Modes\n\n\n\nTrolls\n\n\nHitting the troll switches enough times lights the Trolls!\nlamp to the saucer. When you land in the saucer, both of the\ntrolls will pop out of the playfield, and you must hit them 3\ntimes each. If you do this, you set the Troll Madness light\nto blinking. If you rebound off a troll into the castle or\nthe saucer, you are awarded Troll bombs, which are like the\nmartian bombs in AFM.\n\n\nTo get Troll Madness Multiball, go into the saucer again.\nNow, one troll will pop up. Hit him once, and he drops, and\nthe other pops up. And vice-versa. Keep banging away. Hit ten\ntrolls, and you get the blue dot for Master of Trolls.\n\nMerlins' Magic\n\nMerlin's Magic is like Stroke of Luck. You get a variety\nof awards, from locking balls to troll bombs to starting\nmadness multiball modes.\n\nExtra Ball\n\nThere are lots of ways to light the extra ball lamp. The\neasiest is to destroy two castles (which we will get to\nlater).\n\n\nThe Blue Dots\n\n\nLet's talk about those blue dots again. Remember, they\nare:\n\n\n\nMaster of Trolls\nDefender of Damsels\nPatron of the Peasants\nCatapult Ace\nJoust Champion\nCastle Crusher\n\nLet's go over each on briefly:\n\nMaster of Trolls\n\nBy getting Troll Madness as described above, you light\nthis dot.\n\nDefender of Damsels\n\nThe ramp on the right has a dragon on it. The top of the\nramp has a diverter which normally sends the ball back down\nto the right flipper. If you go up this ramp three times, the\ndiverter opens, and a strongly hit ball goes straight back to\nthe very right back of the machine where there is a damsel in\na tower. She says some heavy attitude quote, and the ball is\nfed into the jet bumpers. Do this once, and you light the\nDamsel multiball madness light for the saucer. Do this three\ntimes and you light the Defender of\nDamsels blue dot.\n\nPatron of the Peasants\n\nThe ramp on the left simply requires that you hit it four\ntimes, on the fourth time you light up Peasant madness. Do\nthis sequence three times and you light up the Patron of the Peasants blue dot.\n\nCatapult Ace\n\nTo the very left of the game, where the MAR standups in\nAFM were is an opening into a catapult. This is the same kind\nof mechanism that Taxi used for Drac. The first tow times you\nhit this, it just shoots the ball really fast around a very\nTaxi-like ramp and loop into the left flipper inlane. On the\nthird time, you get a video mode where you pick the object to\nthrow. I dunno what happens if you throw one of each object,\nbut I expect something cool. After you do this sequence three\ntimes, you get your Catapult Ace\nblue dot.\n\nJoust Champion\n\nBoth of the orbits are Joust orbits. By default they are\nopen, so watch out! Very fast orbits indeed! It does not\nmatter which direction you orbit, the third time you do this\nthe gates close, the ball feeds into the pop bumpers, and you\nlight Joust madness. Do this three times and you get the Joust Champion blue dot.\n\nCastle Crusher\n\nThink AFM saucers. Hit the drawbridge enough times to open\nit. Then hit the gate enough times to open it. Go into the\ncastle to destroy it (very very cool effect!). Destroy all\nfive normal castles, and you go against the King of Payne.\nDestroy his castle to light the Castle\nCrusher blue dot.\n\n\nMadness Modes!!!\n\n\nFor each of the madness modes (Joust, Damsel, Catapult,\nTroll, Peasant) you get a multiball when you land in the\nsaucer. If you have one mode lit and you enter the saucer,\nyou get a two ball multiball. If you have two modes lit (such\nas Damsel and Joust) you get three ball multiball. The most\nballs out are four. The lanes that correspond to the\nmadnesses, i.e. the Joust lanes for Joust madness score super\njackpots, and the jump into the castle scores a double super\njackpot.\nIf you complete all madness modes, you can go for Royal\nMadness, which is a single ball race to hit all the flashing\ntargets. Do it, and you get an extra ball.\n\n\nMiscellany\n\n\nThere are other things, but I am too tired of typing to do\nit right now. Plus, I'm bitter. I lit all the blue dots and\nwas ready to Battle, when I promptly drained. Final score:\n143,678,070. Drat again. Guess I'll hafta go back and\n\"test\" it some more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Medieval Madness", "possible_shots": "orbits (O) on both sides, ramps (R) on both sides, and a jump (J) over the moat into the castle, the castle drawbridge (D), and the saucer (S).

{"page_content": "Subject: Monopoly Strategy Guide\nDate: Thu, 11 Oct 2001 01:06:48 GMT\nFrom: \"Bowen Kerins\" \nOrganization: Road Runner\nNewsgroups: rec.games.pinball\n\nStrategy Guide to Stern's Monopoly\nBowen Kerins\n\nlast updated: October 10, 2001\n\nDo not copy this strategy guide without permission from the author.\n\nFor information about the basic features and playfield of Monopoly, please\nrefer to Jim Hicks' rulesheet for Monopoly, which can be found at\nhttp://www.justbecauseican.com/pinball/monopoly/rules.html.\n\nIt is my understanding that some of the rules have changed and will be\nchanging for other software versions of the game.\n\n--- The Monopoly Board ---\n\nTraveling around the Monopoly board and playing the rounds earned from\nlanding on property is a way to earn varying points, and progress toward\nLand Grab.  There are eight different property groups, and each gives a\ndifferent type of round or award.\n\nLanding on property to collect it can be done one of three ways:\n\n- Shooting the right ramp, then shooting the lane to the left of the center\nramp while no round or multiball is running\n- Shooting the Electric Company when lit for \"Roll\" (after 15% and 60% power\nlevels)\n- Advancing directly to property through a Chance award\n\nYou can also advance around the board by shooting any ramp.  The center ramp\nadvances 1 space, the right ramp advances 2 spaces, and the side ramp\nadvances 3 spaces.  The railroad ramp\n\nWhenever you land on property, you score 1000 times the Monopoly purchase\nprice of the property.  If you land on an unlit property group, you will\nearn that group's round or award.  The group will then be lit until the game\nends, or until you start Land Grab.\n\nAny Monopoly board round which is interrupted by a multiball will not score\nduring the multiball, and will pick up where you left it when the multiball\nends.\n\nHere are the eight groups and their awards.  The award for landing on the\nindividual property is in parentheses.\n\n- Purple Group -\n\nMediterranean Avenue (60,000)\nBaltic Avenue (60,000)\n\nLanding on Mediterranean Avenue sets the lower (Water Works) jets to their\nmaximum point value.  It does not change how quickly the jets add to the\nWater Works value.\n\nLanding on Baltic Avenue sets the upper (Electric Company) jets to their\nmaximum point value, and changes how quickly the jets advance the Electric\nCompany power level.\n\n- Light Blue Group -\n\nOriental Avenue (100,000)\nVermont Avenue (100,000)\nConnecticut Avenue (120,000)\n\nLanding on any of these properties when unlit starts Token Chase.  Token\nChase is similar to \"Catch Me\" from Corvette; shoot any shot to advance your\ncar, and beat the dog to the finish.  Finishing the round earns about 1\nmillion points.  Losing to the dog awards a consolation prize of 150,000.\n\nGenerally, you can ignore this mode and concentrate on advancing to\nmultiball, lighting the next Roll & Collect, or advancing toward Cash Grab\nby shooting the closed Bank Vault.  By making these shots you are likely to\nwin the race anyway.\n\n- Magenta Group -\n\nSt. Charles Place (140,000)\nStates Avenue (140,000)\nVirginia Avenue (160,000)\n\nLanding on any of these properties when unlit starts Free Money.  During\nFree Money, the Electric Company message board will be rolling numbers.\nHitting the Bank Vault will lock in each digit, from right to left: the\nfirst shot locks in the thousands digit, then ten thousands, then hundred\nthousands.  The hundred thousands digit will always be between 5 and 9, so\nthe worst possible Free Money award is 511,000 (?), and the best is 999,000.\nThere is a 15-second time limit.  When time runs out or the ball drains, you\nearn whatever points you have earned from hitting the Bank Vault, so it is\npossible to earn as little as 1,000 from this round.\n\nAn unconfirmed report said that earning 3 of a Kind from these wheels gives\na bonus.\n\nSince the Bank Vault is not a safe shot, and you are not advancing to Cash\nGrab by shooting it during Free Money, this is a good round to skip.  Go for\nit if you hit the Vault by accident; or, you could try shooting the Vault\nfrom the upper flipper.\n\n- Orange Group -\n\nSt. James Place (180,000)\nTennessee Avenue (180,000)\nNew York Avenue (200,000)\n\nLanding on any of these properties when unlit starts Tax Refund.  During Tax\nRefund, each shot to the Bank Vault scores a decreasing value from 500,000\nto 100,000.   The round lasts about 20 seconds.\n\n500,000 is probably worth going for, but 100,000 is not.  Try to hit the\nVault as many times as you can right away, then ignore it as it times out.\nIt is more important (and worth more points!) to light the next Roll &\nCollect by shooting the right ramp.\n\n- Red Group -\n\nKentucky Avenue (220,000)\nIndiana Avenue (220,000)\nIllinois Avenue (240,000)\n\nLanding on any of these properties when unlit starts Cop Chase.  Cop Chase\nis very reminiscent of Clock Chaos from Twilight Zone.  During Police Chase,\none light on the Monopoly board will be lit.  The lights move clockwise, and\nif they reach \"Go To Jail\", the round is over.\n\nHitting the Cop standup target stops the light, reverses its direction, and\nmoves a little faster.  The first Cop target hit scores 250,000 (?), and\neach additional target hit is 50,000 more.\n\nSince the Cop target is a very unsafe shot, this round is generally not\nworthwhile, but try it if you dare.  No matter what happens during this\nround, the Cop standup will be up at the end of the round.\n\n- Yellow Group -\n\nAtlantic Avenue (260,000)\nVentnor Avenue (260,000)\nMarvin Gardens (280,000)\n\nLanding on any of these properties when unlit starts Utility Overload.\nDuring Utility Overload, all bumpers score 10,000 (?), and either Utility\nshot (Electric Company or Water Works) adds 5,000 to the value and scores a\nsmall bonus.\n\nThis can be a very lucrative round, and a fairly safe one.  From the left\nflipper, shoot the spinner to hit both bumper groups.  From the top flipper,\nshoot the Electric Company to add to the value and feed the Water Works\nbumpers.  From the right flipper, shooting into the Water Works may work,\nbut it may be more useful to feed the upper flipper.\n\n- Green Group -\n\nPacific Avenue (300,000)\nNorth Carolina Avenue (300,000)\nPennsylvania Avenue (320,000)\n\nLanding on any of these properties when unlit awards a substantial number of\npoints.  Pacific Avenue awards 1 million, North Carolina Avenue is worth 2\nmillion, and Pennsylvania Avenue is worth 3 million.  No questions asked.\n\n- Dark Blue Group -\n\nPark Place (350,000)\nBoardwalk (400,000)\n\nLanding on either of these properties when unlit lights a major award.\nLanding on Park Place lights extra ball.  Landing on Boardwalk lights\nspecial.  In tournament play, my initial guess is that these would award 4\nand 5 million, but that is a pretty poor guess.\n\n--- The Cop Standup and Drop Target ---\n\nHitting the Cop Standup target (just below the Electric Company shot)\nanytime during single-ball play raises the Cop Drop Target.  This is\ngenerally not a good thing, since you cannot shoot the Roll & Collect lane\nwhen this target is raised.  Dropping the target scores 125,000 the first\ntime, then 25,000 more each time, to a maximum of 250,000.  There does not\nseem to be any special award for a large number of Cop Drops.\n\nBUT if you are playing any round other than Cop Chase, the Cop Drop Target\nalso adds 5 seconds to the timer for that round.  This can be especially\nuseful during Cash Grab and Utility Overload, but is convenient all around.\n\nFor the most part, aiming for the Cop Drop Target is only done when you want\nto get at the Roll & Collect lane.  This is done most safely from the upper\nflipper, but can also be done from either lower flipper.\n\n--- Advancing to Go ---\n\nTo light a lock, you must advance once around the board to Go.  There are\nseveral ways to advance around the board, but one of the quickest is to\nshoot the Railroad ramp.  This ramp moves you forward up to 8 board spaces,\nand the ramp can be shot comfortably from either lower flipper.\n\nA second option is to hit the Advance To Go award from the standup target\nbetween the right ramp and spinner.  It is worthwhile to wait until you are\njust past Go, since Advance To Go will then light the next lock immediately.\n\n--- Monopoly Multiball ---\n\nStart Monopoly Multiball by locking two balls through the center ramp, then\nshooting the right ramp.  During Monopoly Multiball, the side ramp is worth\na 1,000,000 Jackpot, and the Electric Company is lit for a 2,000,000 Double\nJackpot.  The Jackpots can be relit by shooting the Railroad ramp; listen\ncarefully for the Railroad noise so you will know when to expect the ball.\n\nI was unable to figure out the rules which decide which Jackpots are lit\nwhen, so check for yourself.  If the side ramp is lit, the Electric Company\nmessage board will point an arrow up the ramp.  This is pretty convenient,\nsince the light which tells you whether the Jackpot is lit is blocked from\neasy view.\n\nThe side ramp is much easier to hit than the Electric Company (at least for\nme), and the Electric Company on the machine I played had a tendency to\nreject hard shots.  If either of these applies to you, you might want to\nignore the Double Jackpot shot.\n\nOverall, this is a multiball where ball control is very important.  Don't\nforget that you can shoot the Railroad ramp from either flipper.\n\nAny Monopoly board round started before multiball will pause during it, but\nCash Grab will continue.  So, you should try to start Cash Grab just before\nmultiball.  Cash Grab during multiball can be worth over 3-4 million, which\nis a lot of points in this game.\n\n--- Cash Grab ---\n\nCash Grab is started by completing B-A-N-K from the closed Bank Vault, which\nblocks the center ramp.  The Bank Vault is initially closed; when open,\nclose it by shooting the side ramp.  You do not have to hit the Free Parking\ntarget to close the Bank Vault.\n\nCash Grab is a 15-second timed mode where all major shots (ramps, loops,\nlanes, and holes) score.  The first shot is worth 250,000, and each\nadditional shot is 25,000 more.\n\nCash Grab is the only round which can be played during multiball.  This is a\nvery important strategy note, since Cash Grab is started with the same shot\nused to light locks.  It is not too difficult to make sure that multiball is\nready whenever Cash Grab is started, and vice versa.\n\nIndeed, the combination of Cash Grab, Monopoly Multiball, and the Cop Drop\nTarget is one which can earn a remarkable number of points, and is exceeded\nonly by Land Grab.\n\n--- Railroads and Railroad Multiball ---\n\nShoot the Railroad ramp when lit to advance to the next railroad and light\nit.  If the Railroad ramp is unlit, shoot the right loop to relight it.\n\nLighting a Railroad scores 200,000.  Lighting all four railroads lights\nRailroad Multiball.  During Railroad Multiball, all Railroad shots are worth\n250,000.  I don't know if there is a way to raise the value of the jackpot\nin Railroad Multiball.\n\nRailroad Multiball isn't really worth that many points.  You should use the\nRailroad ramp to your advantage in lighting locks, since Railroad shots\nadvance you 8 spaces.  You need to have lit all four Railroads to light Land\nGrab.\n\n--- Electric Company ---\n\nThe Electric Company power level is raised by one of three things:\n\n- the \"Power Up\" award on the standup target between the spinner and right\nramp\n- the Electric Company shot\n- upper bumper hits\n\nUpper bumper hits award a small percentage.  I believe that this is 0.2%\nwhen unlit, 0.4% when solidly lit, and 0.6% when flashing, but I am unsure.\n\nThe Electric Company shot awards a value which is\n\n(1000 x # lit upper bumpers) x (Power Level)\n\nThe # of lit upper bumpers is between 1 and 6 (each flashing bumper counts\ntwice, like Twilight Zone).  This award can be between 1,000 and 600,000.\n\nThe Electric Company shot then adds 5% to the current Power Level.\n\nIn general, the Power Level is raised so slowly that the Electric Company is\nrarely worth more points than the side ramp.  Additionally, the side ramp is\na safe shot when made, while the Electric Company is not.\n\n--- Water Works; Skill Shot ---\n\nThe Water Works value starts at 25,000, and raises by 1,000 for each lower\nbumper hit.  The value is scored by hitting the Water Works hole, which is\nguarded by the spinning flipper.\n\nThe value is multiplied by anything from 1x to 7x, depending on the\nmultiplier value lit next to the Water Works hole.  This multiplier can be\nraised by an award from the standup between the right ramp and spinner.\n\nWhen each ball is put into the plunger, you have the opportunity to score a\nSkill Shot by plunging the ball into the Water Works hole.  This awards the\nsame points that the Water Works hole gives during regular play, so this can\nbe anywhere from 50,000 to over a million.  Judge for yourself based on this\nwhether it is more valuable to try for the Skill Shot, plunge the ball for\nan upper flipper shot, or plunge hard to reach the bumpers.\n\n--- Side Ramp; Free Parking ---\n\nThe side ramp advances you 3 spaces around the Monopoly board, and closes\nthe Bank Vault if it is open.  If you hit the Free Parking target at the top\nof the ramp (which happens more than half the time, I'd say), you score an\naward which starts at 150,000 (?) and raises by 25,000 for each additional\nhit.  Also, hitting the Free Parking target adds 5,000 to the Free Parking\nvalue which carries over from player to player, and game to game.  This\nvalue can be collected repeatedly during Free Parking Multiball.\n\nHow do you get Free Parking Multiball?  I don't remember.  I think it was an\naward from Chance.\n\n--- Other Multiballs ---\n\nChance can also award Ripoff Multiball and Breakout Multiball.  I could not\nsee a difference between the two.  In each, one ramp shot is lit for an\naward.  The award starts at 400,000 and raises by 50,000 for each shot.\n\nPerhaps a future software revision will make these two more different, or\nalready has.\n\n--- Bonus; Bonus Multiplier ---\n\nLike No Good Gophers, either inlane will light the opposite inlane for bonus\nmultiplier.  Additionally, completing the A-B-C lanes above the Electric\nCompany bumpers will advance the bonus multiplier (and advance 8 board\nspaces).  The highest multiplier is 6x.  The first time you reach 6x, Extra\nBall will light.\n\nEnd-of-ball bonus is based on the number of properties you own, the number\nof times you have visited Railroads, and the number of times you have passed\nGo.  All this is multiplied by the bonus multiplier.  If your game has\nlasted a long time, the bonus multiplier becomes more and more important.  I\nhave seen end-of-ball bonus worth over 3 million.\n\n--- Chance; Community Chest; Loose Change ---\n\nThe Chance scoop is lit by shooting the center ramp (?).  Falling into the\nChance scoop, or shooting it on purpose, will give a random award.  There\nare a lot of awards, many of which are standard Monopoly fare:\n\n- Advance to Illinois Ave.\n- Advance to St. Charles Place\n- Advance Token to Nearest Railroad\n- Advance to Boardwalk\n- Award points to EACH player\n- Ripoff Multiball\n- Breakout Multiball\n- Several more I forgot\n\nWell-substantiated rumors claim that you will soon be able to light\nCommunity Chest awards, and score them at this scoop.  In the game I played,\nthere was no way to light or score Community Chest.\n\nIf neither Chance nor Community Chest is not lit and you shoot the scoop,\nyou will be awarded Pocket Change.  Pocket Change plays exactly like Odd\nChange, and like Water Hazard.  It is a low-point random award.  Someone\nmentioned that Pocket Change behaves differently during some rounds,\nawarding more points.\n\n--- Land Grab ---\n\nLight Land Grab at the Roll & Collect scoop after lighting all property and\nrailroads.  Land Grab is a timed round with a short ball saver.  All balls\nwill be sent onto the playfield.  The goal of Land Grab is to add as many\nhouses and hotels to property as possible.  The center ramp adds 2 houses to\na property group; the side ramp adds 4; and the Electric Company adds a\nhotel.  The right ramp advances 2 spaces toward more valuable property\ngroups.  Additionally, you will move ahead automatically if you place a\nhotel on a property group.\n\nI am unsure of scoring, but each house is worth an award (hotels are worth\n5x the base award).  More valuable properties are worth higher awards.  I\nbelieve the highest award is the Dark Blue group (Park Place and Monopoly),\nwhich is worth 1 million per house.\n\nIn my best Land Grab, where I got everything except a hotel on the Dark Blue\ngroup (darn, 4 houses!), the total score for the round was around 17\nmillion.\n\nIt would appear that reaching and playing Land Grab is a strong strategy.\nIt is definitely achievable in 3 balls, and may even be reachable a second\ntime.\n\nUnlike other wizard modes, Land Grab has a very short ball saver, so be\ncareful.  It is much easier to earn hotels with 3 balls than with one.\n\nYou can earn more time during Land Grab, an additional 10 seconds.  I\nbelieve this happens when you shoot the side ramp, but I'm not sure.\n\n--- High Scores ---\n\nMy best score is 87 million, with one Land Grab.  I have heard of people\ncoming close to 100 million, and am sure that someone out there has reached\nand passed it.  Default high score is about 24 million.\n\n--- Other Notes ---\n\nAll players start a Monopoly game with 1500 points, since they start a real\nMonopoly game with 1500 dollars.\n\nI hope this strategy guide is helpful.  E-mail me if you have anything to\nadd or correct.  Enjoy!\n\nBowen Kerins\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Monopoly", "manufacturer": "Stern", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/monopoly-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

INTRODUCTION\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1.1:  Monster Bash is George Gomez' newest pinball creation.  It is also the\nnext-to-last WPC (Williams Pinball Controller) game Williams will\nproduce, as after their next game Cactus Canyon, Williams will introduce\nto the world \"Pinball 2000\" (P2K), whose changes are as yet unknown\nto people outside of Williams.  This is also a licensed game, as\nWilliams licensed some of Universal Pictures' most famous monsters.\nMonster Bash is a fairly simple game, presumably designed for someone\nother than us wizards. :)\n\n1.2:  Design Credits:\n        Design:         George Gomez\n        Software:       Lyman Sheats\n        Music:          Vince Pontarelli\n        Art:            Kevin O'Connor\n        Mech.

PLAYFIELD LAYOUT\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYet another game built on the AFM playfield layout.  If you were good at the\nshots in AFM and Medieval Madness, you shouldn't have too many problems here.\nCall me cynical, but as far as I can tell, George just took the drawings for\nAFM, made a few cosmetic changes, and spat out AFM 3.  Several posters on\nr.g.p. have expressed that Monster Bash feels like a Brian Eddy game (designer\nof AFM and MM), so my conclusion that MB is AFM 3 is somewhat justified.\n\n(in usual order, clockwise from center drain)\n\n* Left flipper and slingshot:\n        Normal.\n\n* Left inlane:\n        Normal-sized, but can be lit for \"Phantom Flip\".  More on this\n        later.\n\n* Left outlane:\n        Normal.  Can be lit for special.\n\n* Creature from the Black Lagoon:\n        Under-the-playfield toy which glows green whenever you shoot\n        the...\n\n* Creature's Black Lagoon:\n        A lane that's in the exact same shape and position as Crazy\n        Bob's in NBA Fastbreak and the Tube in No Fear.  Used to start\n        and in playing \"Creature Feature\".\n\n* Left loop:\n        Can either feed the jet bumpers or careen around just like in\n        AFM.  Used to start and in playing \"Full Moon Fever\".\n\n* Phantom Flip target #1:\n        See \"Phantom Flip\" later on.\n\n* Left ramp:\n        Tight figure-8 ramp that feeds the left inlane.  Used to light\n        and in playing \"Ball and Chain\".  Weak shots will roll back\n        down, carom off the above Phantom Flip target, and hit the right\n        slingshot.\n\n* Phantom Flip target #2\n\n* Frankenstein:\n        2-bank motorized drop target.  Blocks access to the center ramp.\n        Used to light and play Frankenstein Multiball.\n\n* Phantom Flip target #3\n\n* Center ramp:\n        Protected by Frank.  Feeds the right ramp prior to starting\n        Frank Multiball.\n\n* Mosh Pit (center lane):\n        A lane much like the Mode Start/NAS Cure lane on Johnny Mnemonic\n        and in the same position as AFM's saucer.  Awards various awards\n        after so many shots.  Used to light Mosh Pit Multiball.  Used during\n        pretty much everything.  Can be shot from either flipper,\n        although I think it's easier from the right flipper.\n\n* Tomb Treasure Target:\n        A large standup about halfway up the Mosh Pit and offset from\n        the lane itself.  Adds +1X bonus X and the same number of points\n        that 10 jet bumper hits would score.\n\n* Scoop:\n        Fowards-facing-only scoop that awards random awards a la Stroke\n        of Luck or Merlin's Magic.  Used to get the extra ball and in\n        starting Drac Attack, Mummy Mayhem, Mosh Pit MB, Monster Bash, and\n        Monsters of Rock.  No feed from the jet bumpers, but it's got a\n        fairly large mouth so direct shots aren't necessary.\n\n* Jet bumpers and D-I-G rollover lanes:\n        Lanes -- advances the bonus X as normal, and is lit for skill\n                shot at the beginning of each ball.  Successful skill shots\n                award 100K+50K points and a Monster Bomb (think Martian\n                and Troll bombs.  More on these later.)  Spelling D-I-G\n                raises the jet value by 1500 and spots 5 hits on the jets.\n        Jets -- advances toward lighting Mummy Mayhem and starting\n                Mummy Jets (a.k.a. super jets), both occuring at 60 jet hits.\n                During super/mummy jets, the jet values are doubled.\n\n* Right ramp:\n        Flat ramp which loops around and feeds the right inlane.  Weak\n        shots will fall back and normally hit the left flipper.\n\n* Right loop:\n        Same as left loop.\n\n* Dracula's loop:\n        A semicircle in the playfield on which Dracula travels.  (Drac\n        says, \"I will mezzzzzzzmerizzzze you with my semicircular\n        movements!\")\n\n* Dracula's coffin:\n        Where Drac rests when Drac Attack, Monster Bash, and Monsters of\n        Rock are not active.\n\n* \"Drac\" and \"Attack\" standups:\n        In the same position as the \"AN\" martian in AFM.  Used to light\n        Drac Attack.\n\n* Right outlane, inlane, and slingshot:\n        Same as left.\n\n* Plunger:\n        Automatic.  It's also how you use the monster bombs.\n\n\n\nIII.  OBJECTIVE AND MODES\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe objective is to collect the 6 monsters' instruments to light\nMonsters of Rock multiball.  To collect the instruments, you must\n*complete* the modes, not merely *play* them.  Playing all 6 modes lights\na mini wizard mode, Monster Bash.\n\nAll modes are timed modes.  Modes stop when (1) they're completed, (2)\nthey time out, or (3) the ball drains, whichever occurs first.\n\n\n3.1.  Creature Feature (20 seconds AND hurry-up):\n        Similar to Royal Madness in Medieval Madness.  Shoot all major shots --\nboth loops, both ramps, and the Mosh lane in any order before time runs out.\nThe first shot is a 1M hurry-up, subsequent shots score 2X, 3X, 4X, and 5X the\nhurry-up value (max 5M).  Creature Feature ends on the 5th shot.  You have 20\nseconds to shoot each shot; the timer resets to 20 after each shot.  The Black\nLagoon and a spear gun (see monster bombs) will each spot one shot, end\nthe hurry-up if active, and reset the timer, like the super jackpot/lock\nshot during Royal Madness in MM.  The black lagoon may be shot multiple\ntimes during Creature Feature; the lane spotted starts at the first lit\nlane and proceeds clockwise.\n\nCompleting Creature Feature awards the CFTBL's saxophone.\n\nSome quotes:\n        \"He's so cute and slimy.\"\n        \"Amphibians rule!\"\n        \"You're an awesome amphibian!\"\n        \"Wrap your flippers around me, fish-boy!\"\n\n3.2.  Full Moon Fever (4 hurry-ups):\n        Shoot both loops four times collectively.  Those balls will end\nup in the jet bumpers.  Once FMF is started, however, balls will careen\naround, so watch out!  Upon starting FMF, a 1M hurryup is lit on both\nloops.  Shoot to collect and reset the hurryup to 2M, 3M, and 4M.\nEither loop will qualify for any FMF shot, but the ball must completely\nloop around (it doesn't count if the ball lands in the jet bumpers).\nAll hurryups stop at 250k for a few seconds and then expire.\n\nCollect all 4 hurryups during one FMF to get the Wolfman's drums.\nA monster bomb awards the current hurry-up, starts the next one, and\nspots one loop.  The hurryup value increases by 250k per completed Full\nMoon Fever (ie, FMF #2 scores 1.25M --> 2.25M --> 3.25M, etc.)\n\nIf FMF and Mummy Mayhem (q.v.) are active concurrently, the controlled gates\nwill divert the ball to the jet bumpers, so it will not careen around.\nShots will still count.\n\nSome quotes:\n        \"NO, I will NOT be your date to the concert!\"\n        \"But I've had all my shots.\"\n        \"Get away from me, you fleabag!\"\n\n3.3.  Ball & Chain (Up to 4 30-second increments):\n        Shoot each ramp three times to start, and then shoot them each\nthree times more to collect the Bride of Frankenstein's microphone.  The\ntimer may be reset to 30 seconds up to three times by shooting the mosh\npit lane.  Both ramps score 2X the ball and chain value (starts at 500k),\nand the mosh pit lane scores 1X.  Once the Bride's microphone is\ncollected all scoring is tripled until the timer runs out; time can\nstill be extended by shooting the Mosh Pit.  A monster bomb spots one\nramp shot, alternating between the right and left lanes (starting on the\nright).\n\nSome quotes:\n        \"Tall, dark, handsome.  NOT!\"\n        \"It's outta here!\"\n        \"I heard he's got a monstrous organ.\"  (groan....)\n        \"Somebody stop me!\"\n\nWith the 3X scoring once the mode is completed, Ball and Chain can be _very_\nlucrative during multiballs, especially since the timers are stopped (see\n\"Timers during multiball\" section).\n\n3.4.  Frankenstein Multiball:\n        Assemble Frankenstein by shooting him 7 times.  He will then\nraise up and expose the center ramp; shoot it to start Frank MB.  Frank\nMB is a 3-ball MB whose objective is to beat up on Frankenstein.\nCollect 6 super, double super, and/or triple super jackpots by hitting\nFrankenstein to collect his keyboard.  Frank scores super, double super,\nand triple super jackpots; every other major shot scores a normal jackpot\n(base value 400k).  Double and triple super jackpots are lit by shooting\nregular jackpots before shooting a super jackpot: a double super requires\ntwo intervening jackpots and a triple super requires three. Jackpots are\nincreased by 50k and super jackpots are increased by 250k each time you\ncomplete Frankenstein during multiball.  Double supers count as two shots\nto Frank and triple super jackpots count as three.  A flaming torch (see\nmonther bombs) will spot the next lit super jackpot, including double and\ntriple supers if they're lit, so a flaming torch will spot anywhere from 1\nto 3 hits on Frank.\n\nThe way Frank registers hits is a metal bar attached to Frank's torso hits\na microswitch.  More than likely, the microswitch which registers hits\non Frank will get bent or otherwise break over the course of time.  The\nPhantom Flip targets on either side of Frank will compensate when Frank\nis broken.\n\nIf you did not get the keyboard during multiball, Frank will raise up\nand re-expose the center ramp to restart Frankenstein monoball.  This is\nthe \"last chance\" analog of the super jackpot sudden death in AFM or the\nBattle for the Kingdom sudden death in Medieval Madness.  You have 15\nseconds to pound away on Frankenstein and get the remaining amount of\nsuper jackpots to spot the keyboard.  Each hit on Frank restarts the\ntimer at 15 seconds; regular jackpots may still be collected and will\nstil light double and triple super jackpots.  The last chance will\nremain active if Mosh Pit multiball is started, and presumably also\nduring Monster Bash (but you must start last chance before starting the\nmultiball).\n\nSome quotes:\n        * (Igor) \"What a torso!  What's a torso?\"\n        * (Igor) \"You put your left leg in.\"\n          (Scientist) \"This is no time to do the hokey pokey!\"\n        * (Scientist) \"Get ready when I flip the switch!\"\n\nThe light show to start Frank multiball kicks ass.\n\n3.5.  Mummy Mayhem (45 seconds):\n        Think of a 1-ball Rule the Universe.  You have to score 7.5M\npoints within 45 seconds.  All switches scores 50k, and jets are tripled\n(minimum 30k).  Each major shot is lit for a mayhem jackpot, whose score\nis 500k plus all switches since the last mayhem jackpot (like Fear Fest on\nNo Fear) Score at least 7.5M to collect the Mummy's bass.  Started at the\nscoop.  A monster bomb here spots one mayhem jackpot.  Getting a multiball\nrunning concurrent with Mummy Mayhem should make this mode a breeze.\n\nCompleting Mummy Mayhem before time runs out awards a bonus of 250k * (#\nof seconds remaining), so if you complete Mummy Mayhem in 35 seconds\n(leaving 10 remaining), you get a bonus of 2.5M.  Subsequent Mummy\nMayhems require an additional 500k per completed Mayhem to complete.\n\nThe quotes to start and during this mode are *really* funny.\n\n3.6.  Drac Attack (30 seconds):\n        Spell D-R-A-C-U-L-A by hitting the two red \"Drac\" and \"Attack\"\nbuttons on the right side of the playfield 7 times collectively.\nOnce started at the scoop, Drac will come out of his coffin and move\naround periodically.  Each time you hit Drac, the timer resets to 30\nseconds. Hit him five times to collect his guitar.  If you hit him while\nhe's moving, you'll score 2X the Drac value, but you'll only receive one\nhit.  The monster bomb spots one hit on Drac; if you use the monster\nbomb when Drac is moving, you do get the 2X score but only 1 hit.\n\nD-R-A is spotted for you at the beginning of the game.\n\nListen for the quotes when a ball rolls back down the right Bride ramp\nand strikes Drac on his backside.  Otherwise....\n\nSome quotes:\n        * \"Back off, I'm the lead guitarist!\"\n        * \"Hey, those are my Bruno Malis!\"  {the shoes OJ was wearing\n                                             the night of the murders}\n        * \"Do you think you can hit dis bat with dat ball?\"\n\n3.7.  Extra Ball and Special:\n        Collecting a predetermined amount of monsters (usually 3) will light\nan extra ball. Collecting a predetermined amount of instruments (usually 4)\nwill light the special on alternating outlanes.  The EB is lit until\ncollected, but the special is only active for the current ball.  The special\nalternates outlanes each time a slingshot fires.\n\n3.8.  Monster Bombs:\n        Same exact thing as martian bombs in AFM.  Spots 1 hit/shot\ntowards collecting the monster's instrument.  They are, and the monsters\nthat they're for:\n\n        * Garlic clove          Dracula\n        * Hair dryer            Bride of Frankenstein\n        * Ancient scroll        Mummy\n        * Silver bullet         Wolfman\n        * Spear gun             CFTBL\n        * Flaming torch         Frankenstein\n\nThe monster bombs can be collected by skill shot, 3+6 (i.e., 3, 9, 15, 21,\netc.) mosh pit shots, or as an award from the scoop.  Garlic cloves may\nalso be collected by spelling D-R-A-C-U-L-A more times prior to starting\nDrac Attack.\n\n3.9.  Instrument Bonus:\n        Each time you collect an instrument, all major shots (both\nloops, both Bride ramps, and the Mosh Pit) light for Instrument Bonus,\nwhich is Monster Bash's equivalent of victory laps after Rule the Universe\nin AFM.  Scores 900k + (100k * number of instruments collected on that\nball).  Completing a subsequent instrument relights all shots and raises\nthe instrument bonus.  Shooting the mosh pit lane relights all shots but\ndoes not increase the instrument bonus.\n\nInstrument Bonuses will light during multiballs, and any ones active\nprior to starting multiball will remain lit.  Instrument Bonuses are only\nactive for the ball on which the corresponding instrument was received.\n\n\nIV. MULTIBALLS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n4.1.  Mosh Pit:\n        Light by shooting the center lane 6 times.  Started at the\nscoop.  Initially two balls, up to two more may be added -- with a fresh\nbut short ballsaver each time -- by shooting the center lane.  Jackpots are\nworth 750k + (5k * # of mosh pit shots).  Jackpot maxes at 1.5M.  All shots\n(lagoon, both loops, all three ramps, mosh pit) score a mosh pit jackpot.\n10 shots to Frankenstein scores a Mosh Pit Super Jackpot, whose score is a\nfunction of the regular jackpots you collect (expect a value around\n7-10M).  After collecting the super jackpot, Frank's red standups will\nraise up.  Shoot them 5 times to collect the second super jackpot, which\nis 3X the current Most Pit jackpot value.  Then shoot Frank's ramp 10\ntimes to get the first super jackpot again, then the standups 5 times for\nthe second super, etc.: lather, rinse, repeat.  Mosh Pit MB is also lit at\nthe 24th Mosh Pit shot during regular monoball play.\n\n4.2.  Monster Bash:\n        Start (not necessarily complete) all six monsters' modes to\nlight light MB at the scoop.  4-ball multiball with each monster worth\n2M, and the center lane lit for Bash Jackpots of 2M + 500k * number of\nmonsters bashed since last Bash Jackpot (max 7.5M).  Generous ball\nsaver.  Lit as soon as the 6th monster's mode is started.  Subsequent\nMonster Bashes raise the monster value by 500k.  Monster Bash is Monster\nBash's equivalent of AFM's Total Annihilation.\n\n4.3.  Monsters of Rock (wizard mode):\n        Collect all six monsters' instruments by *completing* their\nrespective modes.  Shoot scoop to start.  Each instrument (you may\ncollect it multiple times prior to starting MOR) is worth 5M, and\nthere's a 25M bonus for each *complete* set of instruments.  This total\nis cumulative throughout the game, so your first MOR will give you a\nbonus of at least 55M (25M + 6 x 5M), your second MOR will be at least\n110M, etc.  If you can start MOR without previously starting Monster\nBash, you get an additional 50M.  And that's just the bonus for *starting* MOR!\n\n        MOR itself is a 4-ball multiball with each monster being worth 4M.\nVery generous ball saver.  Every time you shoot all monsters' shots (i.e., the\nblack lagoon, both loops, both ramps, and Frank once each), you will receive\nthe Monsters of Rock jackpot, which is 4M x (# of monster completions).\nThe Mosh Pit will spot one additional monster toward the MOR jackpot per shot,\nprobably starting from the Creature and working clockwise.  Each subsequent\nMonsters of Rock raises each value by 1M, so each Monster scores 5M.\n\n        If you start Monster Bash and can complete all remaining instruments\nduring Monster Bash, Monsters of Rock will automatically start with a\nfresh ballsaver and MOR scoring.  Starting Monsters of Rock\nautomatically terminates any active modes without completing them.\n\n4.3.  MB and MOR Champions\n\n        If your Monster Bash or Monsters of Rock score is high enough,\nyou will be the MB or MOR champion.  Only those points accumulated\nduring the multiball itself count to being champion, so the 105 million\nyou got for starting MOR before MB (55M for the instruments + 50M for\nMOR before MB) will *not* count toward your MOR total.  Most likely you\nwill not receive a free credit for being the MB or MOR champion.\n\n4.5.  Timers stop during multiball:\n        As the animations clearly state, any and all active timers are\nstopped.  But you can still play the mode(s) that is(are) active!  I\ndon't know if this is a bug or a (ahem) \"feature\"[*].  Either way, take\nadvantage of this, and use Frank, Mosh Pit, and/or Monster Bash multiballs\ntoward collecting instruments.  Therefore, if you have a multiball lit, try\nto start at least one mode before starting the multiball.\n\n[*] As in, \"It's not a bug, it's a feature!\"\n\n4.6.  Commentary:\n        Monster Bash and Monsters of Rock multiballs are\nunbalancing to this game. If you can keep them going for a long time, and\ncan get a few of each over the course of a game, 1.5 or even 2 billion on\nthis game is not out of the question. I've gotten an MOR over 400M; my\nscore for the game was 661M, so MOR was 60% of my game's score!!\n\n\nV. SCOOP AWARDS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        Each shot to the scoop will award a random award, much like the\nStroke of Luck in AFM.  Each award is \"featured\", as in a rock band, at\na certain monstrous venue somewhere in the world.  I say monstrous\nbecause Williams renamed common venues to have monstrous names:\nWolfstock, Fillgore East and West, Cadaver Club, etc.  See also \"Lyman's\nLament\".  The awards I've seen are:\n\n        * Points: 50k, 75k, or 100k\n        * Light EB\n        * Light Drac Attack\n        * Light Mummy Mayhem\n        * Start ____________  (any monster's mode)\n        * Advance ____________ (toward starting a monster's mode)\n        * ____________ monster bomb (any monster bomb)\n        * Hold bonus X\n\n\"Advance Mummy\" spots 10 hits on the jet bumpers, whereas \"Advance\n(anything else)\" spots one shot or hit.  \"Advance Bride\" alternates which\nramp it will spot, unless one ramp is already completed.\n\n\nVI. MISCELLANEOUS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n6.1.  Phantom Flip:\n        By hitting the three Phantom Flip targets 7 times collectively,\na stackable amount of Phantom Flips can be lit on the inlanes.  Phantom\nFlip is the return of Thing Flips!  Monster Bash used some AI to flip\nthe flipper for you, taking what the game thinks is the best shot.  More\noften than not, however, I've seen Phantom Flip fail to make the shot\ncleanly, so the ball caroms off somewhere.  Probably after many plays,\nthe AI will have improved enough so that the Phantom Flip becomes\naccurate, i.e., it must be \"trained\".  On the machine that I play, the\nPhantom Flip completes its shot maybe half of the time.\n\nEvery 7 hits on the Phanton Flip targets spots 2 Phantom Flips, which\nare stackable and carry over from ball to ball.  As soon as you use one,\nthe remaining flip(s) light up on the opposite inlane, and may be\nswitched by hitting the flippers (i.e., they're somewhat\nplayer-controlled).\n\n6.2.  Extra balls:\n        Can be lit by --\n        * Enough monsters (reflexes)\n        * 12 Mosh Pits\n        * Scoop Award\n\nThe monster EB is available after every Monster Bash, much like how the\ncastle EB is available after every Battle for the Kingdom in Medieval\nMadness.  The instrument special is a one-time-only thing: collect it or\nlose it for the rest of the game.\n\nThe animation for extra ball is reminiscent of the AFM martian getting\nbonked upside the head with a pinball: Drac is bustin' a move and gets\nsquished by a disco ball.  Drac normally provides the quote \"Extra\nball!\", but if Full Moon Fever is running, the Wolfman will howl it\ninstead.\n\n6.3.  Lyman's Lament:\n        After shooting the scoop 43 times during normal (i.e.,\nnon-multiball) play, the 44th award is \"Lyman's Lament\", which is\nsupposed to be something really cool.  Lyman Sheats himself provides the\nspeech for this mode.\n\nThere is a cheat code to start Lyman's Lament without having to shoot\nthe scoop 44 times.  The spoiler is:\n\nStart the game with at least one credit remaining on the machine.  Prior\nto launching the ball, enter the following flipper code:\n11L,1R,5L,1R,6L,1R.  Launch the ball, don't drain, and shoot the scoop.\n\n6.4.  Strategy:\n        MULTIBALL!!!  Which one is irrelevant, just keep 'em going for a\n        long time, and try to start them when you've got modes running.\n        Getting Monster Bash should just about guarantee at least a\n        replay.\n\n6.5.  Ball Saver:\n        The factory default for the beginning-of-ball ballsaver is OFF.\n\n6.6.  Easter Eggs and Cool Backglass Stuff:\n        * Elvira and Wonder Woman appear on the backglass, to the right\n          of all the monsters.\n        * Usually, if you've collected 5 monsters and/or 5 instruments,\n          the scoop will generally start the remaining monster's mode.\n          Multiple times, even!\n        * Cows:\n                * \"Cow palace\" venue\n                * On the left side of the Mosh Pit MB animation is a cow\n                  skeleton\n        * Some of the peasants on the backglass are wielding\n          non-standard farm implements like a Garden Weasel (looks like\n          a pitchfork with gears) and a shrub trimmer.\n        * Dracula is simultaneously on stage and in the audience.\n        * There is a DOHO in this game.  Look for it in the graveyard\n          when Igor picks up pieces of Frank's body.\n\n6.7.  Canceling animations:\n        You can stop any animation at any time by pressing both flippers\n        simultaneously, like you do to speed up a bonus count.\n\n\nVII.  FUN WITH BONUS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n        The bonus is just a switch count multiplied by the bonus X, just\nlike in AFM and MM.  Getting a 20X-30X bonus X on this game is fairly\neasy, since there are two ways to advance it (the D-I-G rollovers and\nthe Tomb Treasure target) and multiballs are plentiful.  Many balls\nduring a multiball will hit the Tomb Treasure target by accident.  Since\nLyman Sheats did the software for AFM, MM, and MB, I presume that the bonus\nX maxes out at 250X.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n\nQuestions?

This is just\nthere for you (benefit) and who desperately needs it (i.e. don't have access to\nthis machine nearby).\n\nOverview\n\nNBA Fastbreak is the latest release from WMS and the George Gomez\ndesign team.  I love Gomez's previous games, Corvette and\nJohnny Mnemonic, and was eagerly awaiting his next game.  I'm\na trifle disappointed in NBA Fastbreak, but then again I like\nhis former games more than the r.g.p consensus.\n\nIt's still an outstanding game.  It's \"different\" in several\nways.  The scoring is like the Real NBA, meaning that 300 points\nis a terrific score.  The scoring is balanced, and completely\nlinear.  That in itself is a major difference.\n\nGameplay can be very slow (stop-and-go) due to the top saucers.\nThis turned me off at first but I've gotten used to it.\n\nHaving 29 high scores (1 for each NBA team) is neat.\n\nNBA FB is probably a \"novice\" game, because the shots are all\nvery easy, and it's a lot easier to do something that lets\nyou enter your initials.  It should still be fun for wizards,\nif you don't mind \"working\" at a game (meaning dealing with\nslow play and very few \"pressure\" shots).  Extra Balls are\neasy; it's not difficult to go from 3 to 5 or 6 balls.\n\nThe ideal environment for NBA FB is probably where I play it:\na college bar that is filled with people at night to play with\n/against and to have as spectators.  Also, having a lively\nenvironment substitutes for the frequent slow / \"automatic\"\nplay.\n\nNBA FB is very well made in every respect (other than\npossibly the bumpers, but I have only 1 machine to base\nmy opinions on that on).  It's yet another reminder of\nhow many light years WMS is ahead of Sega in sheer quality,\nfrom mechanics to rules to sound (not dots :).  It deserves\nto be a big winner for them.\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of NBA Fastbreak is to get to Trophy Multiball\nby completing the 6 Tasks, win a Ring, and score as many\npoints as possible along the way.  Then do it again.\n\nPlayfield\n\nHere's the playfield and what shots do in one-ball, non-mode play...\n\nThere are five major shots.  They're all easy:\n\n\nLeft Orbit  loops up and around a very shallow ramp and\nback to the Right Inlane.  Starts In The Paint when lit.\nIf In The Paint isn't lit, the Alley-Oop Combo is lit and\nis started here.  Weak shots fall into the Basket Area.\n\nLeft Ramp  a short mid-field ramp that usually curves\naround to feed the Left Inlane, like the one on Scrawny\nBubonic.  There's a diverter that can be raised to let the\nball ramp up to the top of the playfield and around to\nthe Basket.  This is a killer shot and my favorite shot\nin the game :).  Can be lit for a 3-point basket.  If 3-point\nis not lit, Fastbreak Combo is lit to start here.\n\nCenter Ramp  dead center in the playfield.  A lot easier\nfrom a caught ball than a live one.  Leads to the Basket.\nA miss here (you make it halfway up the ramp and then\nback down) is the main drain shot in the game.  Thus, I\nshoot this from caught balls if possible.  Can be lit for\na 3-point basket.  If nothing else is lit, Free Throw is\nlit for 1 point (this is true in all modes and MBs).\n\nRight Ramp  a short mid-field ramp that feeds the Right\nInlane.  Starts both Fastbreak Combo and Slamdunk Combo.\nFor me, this shot is harder than the Left Ramp, but that's\nprolly cuz of the extreme left->right lean on my machine...\n\nRight Lane  if In The Paint is lit, starts In The Paint\nin the Basket area.  Otherwise, starts the Tip Off Combo\nand feeds the bumpers.\n\n\n\"Minor\" shots / areas:\n\n\nLeft Saucer  like the one on T2 and NF.  Gives one of\nBob's Crazy Stadium Goodies when lit.  Gives Extra Ball\nwhen lit.  For me this is the \"hardest\" shot in the game.\n\nLane-Between-Center-Ramp-And-Right-Ramp  where balls come\nout of the bumpers.  Go up this lane to get a cool\n\"electromechanical\" sound, and hopefully get some bumpers.\n\nInlanes  light the opposing In The Paint shot, most of the\ntime.\n\nInbounds Pass targets  two standups below the Right Lane entrance\n(a la Johnny) that, when both hit, light Inbounds Pass at the\nLeft Outlane.  This works regardless of mode except that I\nthink in multiballs if you light this, then use it (I hate\nusing up ballsavers in MB), you can't\nlight it again until you're back to one ball.  Inbounds Pass\nreturns the ball from the plunger. If you lose the ball and the inbounds\npass is lit, you will lose it at the next ball.\n\nMillion Dollar Shot  on ball 3 or after final extra ball, the right\noutlane is lit for this.  If you drain down the right, another ball\nlaunches and you have ~10 seconds to hit the basket from the center ramp.\nNote: there is no compensation if hit the ramp, but miss the basket.  If\nyou make the shot, you win a million dollars and your game continues.  If\nyou don't make it, you're obviously not even good enough to be a ball-boy,\nso your game ends. If MDS is lit and you awarded an extra ball, then it\nwill go off and relight at the next ball. \n\n3-P-T  three standups in a lovely shade of purple.  When\nall are hit, 3-point basket is lit at Left and Center Ramps.\nYou will never aim for these.\n\nBasket  a hoop that is fed by the Center Ramp (always),\nthe Top Saucers (always), and the Left Ramp (sometimes).\nMost of your points come from hitting the Basket.  Sometimes\nthe shots that are supposed to feed the Basket miss; there\nis compensation for this, see below.  After a Basket, the\nball heads for the bumper area, where hopefully it will hit\nsome of them before dribbling out to the flippers.  There's\na magnet below the Basket that can hold the ball.\n\nIf the Basket is not lit for anything else, it's lit for a\nFree Throw and 1 point.  10 Free Throws light an Extra Ball\n(see below).  Settings are vary and each machine is different. For my\nmachine, it is after 3rd or 5th three throw.  You can only use this\nmethod once (1) per game. \n\nFour Top Saucers  an arc of four saucers beneath the Basket.\nWhen the ball lands in one of these, it is shot up a wireform\nand into the Basket.  Except when you're in In The Paint mode,\nwhere you have a plastic guard that can block your shot to\ncontend with, and so you can pass left or right (to another\nsaucer) with the flippers.\n\nBumpers  3 of 'em.  They're cool-looking.  Your enjoyment\nof NBA Fastbreak will depend amazingly much on how well these\nwork on your machine.\n\nBackglass  backglass flipper alert!  There's a orange ball\nthe size of a ping-pong ball (is it a ping-pong ball?) that\ncan be hit with a flipper into a \"basket\" on the backglass.\nYou only have control of the flipper during Pizza mode.\nThe flipper flips by itself at various times during in the\ngame, making a sound like Tackle from WCS.  This is also what\nhappens when you win a credit.\n\n\nBasket Compensation\n\nIf you shoot the Basket by the Left or Center Ramp and hit the\nRamp but miss the Basket, there's compensation.  If the\nball falls in one of the Top Saucers (it usually will),\nthe saucer will shoot the Basket and you'll get credit for\nwhatever you were shooting for, if it isn't exceedingly long\nafter you made your ramp shot.  You'll also get credit\nfor the 1-2-3-4 (see In The Paint) saucer.\n\nChoose Team / Skill Shot\n\nAfter firing up a game, you get to pick which of the 29 NBA\nteams you'll be playing for.  As you cycle thru the teams\nyou can see the current NBA Team Champion for that team.\nYou'll hear the players from your team mentioned throughout your\ngame.\n\nFor the \"Skill Shot\", Tip-Off Combo is lit.  If you've already\ncollected it, nothing special happens.  The ball is dropped\nin the bumper area from the \"plunger\".\n\nExcept that there's no plunger, or normal plunger button.\nInstead there's a button on the lock-down bar.  The Riverboat\nGambler market should be happy.\n\nTasks\n\nMost of NBA Fastbreak gameplay involves completing the\nsix Tasks needed to start Trophy Multiball.\nThey are listed below in the order I typically get them.\n\n\n Goals - completed by getting a 2-point goal, a 3-point goal,\nand a Free Throw.\n\n 20 Points - completed by getting... 20 points.  This is lit\nfor you after the first Trophy Multiball.\n\n Combos - there are four Combos.  Get all four to complete\nthis task and light Extra Ball (EB lit only for the first\ncompletion).  Each Combo awards 2 points.  After starting\na Combo, you have a few seconds / switch closures to complete it.\n\nYou can start Combos in single-ball play unless a Stadium\nGoodies or Power Hoops mode is running.\n\n\n Tip-Off: start by hitting the Right Lane if lit\n(it's lit unless In The Paint is lit there).\nComplete at the Center Ramp.\n\nTip-Off is also started at the beginning of a ball\n(as the Skill Shot) if it has not been collected.\nThus, this is the first thing you go for in a game.\n\n Slam Dunk: start by hitting the Right Ramp (always lit).\nCollect at the Left Ramp.\n\n Alley-Oop: start by hitting the Left Orbit if lit\n(it's lit unless In The Paint is lit there).\nComplete at the Center Ramp.\n\n Fast Break: start at the Left or Right Ramp (always lit).\nCollect at the Center Ramp.\n\n\n Stadium Goodies - our beloved Crazy Bob is back again, serving\nyummy concessions.  Hit the left saucer when lit (anytime in\nsingle-ball play except when a Stadium Goodies mode is already\nrunning) to start one of four modes.  These are awarded in the\nbelow order.\n\n\n Pizza: quick, look up at the backglass!  You have ~10 seconds\nto flip the backglass ball into the hoop.  The value of the\nhoop alternates between 1, 2, and 3 points.  If you time your\nflips right and are a little lucky, you should be able to\nget the 3 points with every shot.\n\nMy high on this mode is 18 (six 3-pointers), and I average about\n15.  If you're on your last ball and Pizza is lit, you should\ngo for it, as this is a major source of points.\n\n Hot Dog: the shot clock is set to 24 (== ~10 seconds).  Hit\nany of the 5 main shots to score 3 points and reset the shot\nclock.  Eventually the clock starts resetting to progressively\nlower values.  The mode ends when the clock times out.\n\nThis mode can be worth a ton (20-30) points.  I usually go\nfor the \"quick\" shots (left orbit, left ramp, right ramp).\n\n NBA Trivia: the display gives you a NBA Trivia question and\nfour possible answers.  Get the right one for 10 points. If\nyou got the wrong answer, you will only get 1 point.  There is one\ntrivia question that relates to this game.\n\nIncluded below is a mini-database of NBA Trivia answers\nif it seems useful.  I've seen about 30 different questions.\nThey're not that hard, but obviously you don't want to get\none you don't know the answer to when you're working on your\nall-time best game!\n\nI'm curious to see how this plays in a tournament.  Will\nspectators shout out the answer?  Or will they be barred\nfrom doing so?  Or will tourney mode always offer the\nsame order of questions?\n\n Egyptian Soda: hit the left or right ramp for 3 points.\nThis mode seems to last about 15 seconds.\n\nIf this is the last mode I need for Trophy MB, or if I\nonly need Hoops modes, I'll catch the ball and let the\nmode time out.\n\n\nAfter Egyptian Soda times out, the Concessions Task is completed.\n\nDuring Hot Dog and Egyptian Soda, any Hoops mode that is running\nis postponed until the Concessions mode is completed.  Also,\nbumpers do not advance Hoops modes.  Advancing to Shoot Around\nMB and Around the World MB are still available, though.\n\nWhen all Stadium Goodies is complete, you can still go there for\n1 point (1 point added to your score).\n\n Multiballs - Finish Shoot Around Multiball and Around The World\nMultiball to complete this Task.\n\nShoot Around MB: start by hitting all five major shots (any order)\nto spell S-H-O-O-T.  The S-H-O-O-T letters can be collected\nanytime in single-ball play.  If a Power Hoops or Stadium Goodies\nmode is running when S-H-O-O-T is completed, that mode is postponed\nuntil Shoot Around is completed.\n\nShoot Around is a 2-ball MB.  The important thing to do here\nis to spell S-H-O-O-T again (the letters are flashing until\ncollected) to light Extra Ball.  Also, any flashing shot is\nworth 2 points.  Once S-H-O-O-T is completed the letters are\nreset (to flashing).\n\nThis mode can be another big point-getter.\n\nI don't think you can get the Shoot Around EB more than once.\n\nAround The World Multiball: the four saucers at the top of the\nplayfield are numbered 1 thru 4.  When one of the four are\ncollected, a lamp on a player above the saucer is lit.\nCollect all four to start Around The World MB.\n\nThere are two ways to light the saucers:\n\n\n In The Paint.  The inlanes light In The Paint at the opposite\nOrbit/Lane in single-ball play.  This also turns off the Alley\nOop or Tip-Off lights.  In The Paint stays lit for ~10 seconds,\nafter which it goes out and Alley Oop / Tip-Off is re-lit.\nUnless it's lit from starting a ball; then it doesn't go\nout until you hit it.\n\nHitting the Orbit/Lane when In The Paint is lit starts In The\nPaint Mode.  The ball should land in one of the four saucers\n(if it dribbles out first, you're out of luck).  A plastic guard\nstarts moving toward your saucer, trying to block your shot.\nAvoid the guard by passing among the saucers with the flippers.\nWhen you're free, shoot the Basket with the Basket button.\n\nYou shouldn't ever get blocked by the guard if you know what\nyou're doing.  Unfortunately, sometimes the shot from the\nsaucer to the Basket will miss, and In The Paint is over.\n\n Also, if the ball lands in one of the saucers when In The Paint\nis not lit, the saucer will shoot automatically, collecting\nthe 1-4 number for the saucer and whatever the Basket was\nlit for (see Basket Compensation).  This happens quite a lot,\nfrom weak Left Orbit shots or shots to the Basket that don't\nfall in.\n\nAt times, you will be prompted to hit the \"Shoot\" button for a \"Foul\nShot.\" This counts as a Free Throw (1 pt.)  If you don't do this you\nwon't get the point.\n\n\nOnce 1-4 is completed, Around The World MB starts.  It's a 3-ball\nwhere one of the five major shots is flashing for 1 times the\n# of balls in play.  Basket compensation is active, and you'll\nuse it (likely w/o knowing it).  The flashing shot is\nthe Left Orbit first, and moves right each time points are collected.\n\nThere's not much reason to go for the flashing shots;\nthe points per effort just isn't worth it.\nInstead, shoot Free Throws in this MB and advance toward the\nFree Throw Extra Ball.\n\n Power Hoops and Power Points - here's my main complaint\nwith this game.  To complete the Power Hoops task, you have\nto complete the four Power Hoops modes.  The problem is\nthat these modes are started\nwith bumper hits, and if you have a machine (like mine) with\nvery insensitive bumpers, it becomes extremely difficult and\nboring to get through all four modes.  It's typical for me\nto have all other five Tasks completed, but only one of the\nfour Power Hoops modes.  Ugh.\n\n\nAnyway, here's the rules... bumper hits during non-mode,\nsingle-ball play (I'm fairly sure that's it) advance the\nPower Hoops bumper count.  On my machine, the four modes are\nstarted at 11, 22, 33, and 44 hits.  If your machine gives\nyou at least 3 hits per Right Lane shot, and balls coming\nout of the Basket give you a couple of hits, you're OK.\nBut if you're getting 0 or 1 hit per Right Lane shot, and 0\ncoming out of the basket, you're looking at trouble.\nSettings are vary for Power Hoops for each mode.  For others, it will\nstart at 9, then 18, etc.\n\nIt does seem that Fastbreak has some compensation for this.\nUnfortunately it doesn't seem to do nearly enough.  Over\ntwo weeks on my machine, the required bumper count has lowered\nfrom 13 to 11 hits per mode.\n\nCrazy Bob awards, In The Paint, Shoot Around and Around The\nWorld MBs, and Free Throws are all available during Power\nHoops modes.  If a new mode is started, the Power Hoops\nmode is postponed and picks up after the new mode is finished.\nCombos are not available during Power Hoops modes.\n\nThere are three single-ball Power Hoops modes.  They last for\nabout 20 seconds.  In all three, one shot is lit for 3 points.\nThey are:\n\n\n Half Court Hoops - Center Ramp.\n Hook Shot Hoops - Left Ramp.\n Run & Shoot Hoops - alternate Left and Center Ramps.\n\n\nAlso, the bumpers give you 1 or 2 Power Points every five or\nsix bumper hits.  Power Points are also available during\nsingle-ball, non-mode play (but you get more of them during\na Power Hoops mode, I think).  I'm not clear on Power Points\nor how they may affect strategy.\n\nThe fourth Power Hoops mode is Multiball Hoops.  It's a two-ball\nmode, and the Left and Center ramps are alternately lit for\n3 points.  I don't think Power Points are available during\nMultiball Hoops for some reason.\n\nTrophy Multiball\n\nWhen all 6 tasks are completed, Trophy Multiball automatically\nstarts (if you lose the ball before it starts, and yes this\nis possible, it'll start on your next ball).\n\nYou have unlimited balls for about 20 seconds.\nThe Center Ramp is lit for 2 points.  Your goal is to\noutscore the \"other team\".  It seems like 6 or 7 shots\nare necessary to do this (the first time, anyway).  I don't\nknow if the # of required shots depends on anything you're\ndoing.\n\nIf you win, you get a Ring, and become the current M.V.P.\nYou don't get any extra points for winning, just the points\nyou scored during the mode.  Then all Tasks (except 20 points)\nare cleared and you get to do it again.  Look out for the\nball, as it autoplunges (I don't like this.  You should get\na break after a wizard mode... ).\n\nExtra Balls\n\nThere's several Extra Balls in NBA Fastbreak.  Thankfully,\nnone are random!  Nice job on this, WMS.  EBs are lit at the\nleft saucer.  There's no limit to stacked lit EBs or awarded EBs.\n\nHere's how you can light an EB:\n\n\n Completing all four Combos.\n\n During Shoot-Around MB, spelling the letters S-H-O-O-T.\nI think this gives an EB only the first time it's done\n(i.e. not after Trophy MB).\n\n 10 Free Throws.  I like to go for Free Throws during\nAround The World MB.  Settings are different, for mine, it's only 3.\nYou can only do this method once per game.\n\n 22 (!!) Left Orbit Loop Combos (or whatever).  I've never\ncome close to getting this one.  It's hard to get a Loop\nCombo without actually trying for one.  You have to get\ntwo Left Orbits in a row to get a Combo.  I need more info\non this, in particular whether there's any reason to go\nfor it.  Again, settings are different.  For mine, it's only 12.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nBonus: there is none.  So don't be afraid to tilt when losing\nyour ball ;).\n\nYou *can* score 0 points on a ball.  Trivia: what's the last\nWMS game on which you could do this?\n\nNBA MIA: Jordan, Barkley, Shaq.  More?\n\nMatt Geiger is da absolut best player in the NBA.\n\nStrategy\n\nI'll fill this out more in the next version.  There just aren't\ntoo many real strategy decisions in NBA FB.  Make sure you get\nPizza / Hot Dog / Trivia before ending the game, as that's where\nthe big points are.  You do have to decide whether to play\nthe Power Hoops modes or not; they're potentially worth a lot\nof points, but you don't have to play them to advance to\nTrophy MB, just start them.  Be sure to get your Free Throw EB.\nAround The World is not worth enough to go for it (more than\nonce) over getting to Trophy.  Same for getting Combos more\nthan once.  Learn which shots lead to the most bumper hits.\nDecide when Inbound Pass is worth relighting (for me, rarely).\n\nHigh Scores\n\nThere's no typical high score table for NBA Fastbreak.  Instead,\nBeating the current best score for your team makes you an\nNBA Team Champion and you get to enter your initials.\nI wonder if anything happens if you are the Champion for\nall 29 teams...\n\nThere is a Grand Champion for the all-time best score.\nOn my machine, getting GC is the only way to get a replay\n(other than matching).  I hear this is default behaviour\nfor pre-production ROMs but may change.\n\nWhen comparing scores, Rings always beats Points.  Thus,\n150 and 1 Ring beats 200 and no Rings.\n\nWinning a Ring makes you M.V.P.\n\nThe boys @ WMS have picked their favorite teams for the\ndefault Team Champion scores.  These are:\n\n\n Chicago: LED, 3 Rings, 136\n Boston: LFS, 2 Rings, 104\n LA Lakers: ADG, 1 Ring, 72\n Cleveland: ROG, 80?\n (please tell me if you know of more)\n\n\n<BRAG>My high score is 2 Rings, 294.  I currently am Team Champion\nfor 24 of the 29 teams :).  Today I played a four-player game\nand won a Ring for three of them.</BRAG>\n\nCompetitive Play\n\nI have not played a competitive game of NBA Fastbreak.\nI suspect that it would make an excellent competitive game,\nbut that's just a hunch.  The big decision would be whether\nto count rings over points.\n\nIt appears that NBA will be the tourney game @ WWPF.\nThere have been talk of some odd way to physically connect\nmachines to compare scores, and maybe this will be tested\nthere.  The idea doesn't overwhelm me.\n\nCurrently, tourney mode does nothing.\n\nRules for competitive Play (2 machines liked together) (general only, non-tourney)\n\n There are 4 Quarters similar to a regular NBA game + overtimes if\nnecessary (don't know time for OT)..\n Each quarter is 3 minutes long.  (Similar to Arcade NBA games)\n Each Extra Ball you collect adds 30 seconds to the time remaining in\nthe quarter/regulation.\n You get unlimited ball savers til time expires.\n When time expires, everything stops, ball(s) drains...\n Same rules apply as in a 1 player game.\n The person with the most points wins..\n Free game is the same number of points needed as in a 1 player\nmachine.  Settings may very.\n\n\nYou can still do the traditional 4 player 1 machine method as well.\n\nPossible Bugs\n\nI haven't been able to find many, and even these are questionable...\n\nIn a multiplayer game, if >1 player gets a ring, the last player\nto do it gets M.V.P., rather than the one with the higher score.\n\nDesign Credits\n\n\n Point Guard: Tom Uban (software?)\n Shooting Guard: Tom Kopera (sound?)\n Power Forward: Kevin O'Connor (art)\n Quick Forwards: Adam Rhine and Brian Morris (dots)\n 6th Man: Paul Barker (mechanix?)\n Coach: George Gomez (design)\n\n\nYeah, I should know by heart what all of the above do at\nWMS, but I don't.\n\nHelp!\n\nMore info is wanted for...\n\n\n if you can get the Shoot Around EB more than once.\n if you can get the Left Orbit EB at all.\n what determines how many goals you need to win Trophy MB.\n who did what on design.\n if a Trivia db would be useful.\n\n\nThanks\n\nThanks to Poor Richard's, Johnson City, TN, for providing\nthe local NBA Fastbreak.  For my own records, it's\nSN 53353-100213, startup info <0.1 ROM 92639>.\n\nThanks to WMS for yet another great game!\n\nThanks to Scott Piehler (rosco29@mindspring.com) for helping out.\n--\nSteve Lane\n\nTrivia Stuff\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIf you don't want to look at the Q and A for trivia section, leave right\nnow.

DeVincentis\nVersion: 2.0\n\n\nOK, this should pretty much be the finished version of the rule sheet.\nThere are still some areas that could use some more work (quotes,\ntournament rules, etc.) but the basic rules as used in the typical\ngame on location are pretty much finished.\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\n\nI think I have gotten most of the rules on here complete now, so I'm\ngoing to call this version 2.0.  Adrian Donati wrote version 1.0 of this\nrule sheet, and in a few places the \"me\" in play experiences still refers\nto him.  Since then I have made a lot of additions with a lot of help from\nvarious people.\n\n\nDistribution and Copyright:\n\n\n[This was from Adrian's version 1.0.  I agree with Adrian that I'd like to\nsee this distributed freely, as long as it is not for profit.]\n\nIt has been suggested to me that I retain copyright on this sheet. However,\nI do not know of the legal standpoint here of whether I could even do that.\nWhatever the case, I am quite happy for this to be a freely distributable\nsheet as long as:\n\n It is not done for profit or financial gain.\n It is distributed in its original form (specifically including any/all\nacknowledgments).\n\n\nIt must also be remembered that the subject material of this document\n(ie the 'No Fear' pinball game) is copyright to Williams Electronic\nGames Inc.\n\nCurrent Maintainer\n Joseph DeVincentis\n\nOriginal Author\n Adrian Donati\n\nOther Contributors and Acknowledgements\n\n Cameron Silver\n Mark Divitini\n Bowen Kerins\n Philip Lindsay\n Brad Sagarin\n Mark Phaedrus\n Keith Johnson\n Matt Coriale\n Michael Burke\n Russel Willoughby\n Bryan Henson\n James Furdell\n Rob Chesnavich\n John Brothers\n\n\nAll corrections/contributions/suggestions etc should be sent to me,\nand I will add them as appropriate. However, please remember that\nmodern pinballs have settings which can be adjusted dynamically\nby the control software so one persons local game may well play\na bit differently to another. Where possible, I will try to list the\nrange in which such settings can fall.\n\nAbbreviations used here:\n\nT2      Terminator 2\nBK2K    Black Knight 2000\nGetaway High Speed 2: The Getaway\nDM      Demolition Man\nMYM     Meet Your Maker, the final 'wizard mode' in No Fear.\nMK3     Mortal Kombat 3, a video game made by Williams.\n\n\nNon-pinball related abbreviations:\n\nBTW     By the way\n\n\nWhat's New in this Version:\n\n Rob Chesnavich did a lot of glass-off work to help in these areas:\ntrack awards, summit awards, climber awards, challenges, extra\nsounds in sound tests, 100B+ scores, limits on jumps etc.\n Added end-of-ball bonus.\n More complete description of the 3-D glasses thing, and the buyin\nbutton bonus during air challenge.\n I still want quotes from water challenge (\"insane\", etc.) and for\ndrains (with and without autofire).\n\n\nOverview\nThe theme of the game, as suggested by the artwork, audio track,\nmodes etc., is dangerous sports (it also says it at the bottom\nof the backglass which is the real pointer :) . My first impression\nwas that it had a lot in common with The Getaway but there are\nsimilarities with T2, Demo-Man and others. Play is fairly fast with\na big emphasis on loops and ramps and not much else.\nPlayfield Layout\nAs is the convention these days, I'll start at the left flipper and go\nclockwise around playfield. This should be pretty simple since the centre\nis one of the most open I've seen in a long time; reserved mainly for lights.\n\nFlippers and slingshots retain a traditional configuration with the flippers\nbeing of standard (ie not 'mutant pygmy' variety) length, and the slingshots\nbeing the common triangular type.  Plunger is the common large button\nauto-plunger used on many games today.\n\n\nLeft Inlane\n    Fed from the left habitrail and can be lit for Hurry Up at the\nright orbit.\n\nLeft Outlane\n    A popular place for balls to drain although there is a Kickback.\nThe In/Outlane arrangement is exactly like Getaway. It can be\nlit for Jump This.\n\nTube Saucer\n    A short, curved lane feeds to a saucer. As with most of the\nshots, it has a variety of functions (see later) and it awards a\nrandom award when nothing else is lit there. This is just like\nthe Database saucer in T2 - you are even told to \"get out\" when it\nis not lit (which is mainly during certain challenges).\n\nScreamer Orbit\n    Left orbit with a spinner just at the beginning of it which loops\naround the back of the playfield and feeds to the right flipper\n(just like Getaway). This can be lit for Raceway and Super Spin\nand also collects a Hurry Up.  \n\nJumps Ramp\n    Left ramp feeds up into the Jumps Loop. Can be lit for Hill Climb,\nWin, Left Turn and Super Cross. Collect Super Jackpot here.\n\nThis ramp has a neat little feature too: When a shot makes it up\nthe ramp, it only need get about half way (ie just past the gate) and\nthen a magnet grabs it and slings it the rest. If you imagine the\nSupercharger on Getaway you'd be pretty close. This means that\neven a weak flipper should be able to  make the Jumps Loop.  Of\ncourse, there is the possibility that the magnet fails, in which case\nthe ball rolls back and feeds via the left habitrail to the left\ninlane.\n\nAlso, these magnets (there are actually 3 of them in a row) can\nbe used to stop the ball then feed it to the left inlane in\ncertain circumstances.\n\nJumps Loop\n    As noted, this is a lot like the Supercharger on Getaway. It sits\nover some of the regular playfield shots (but does not significantly\nobscure anything) and is basically a circular ramp with a flipper\nlocated on the right about halfway up the cabinet. When you finally\nmiss a loop the ball will either drop out of the loop near to\nSkull, or feed to the right inlane.\n\nBecause of the way the flipper is located, and the way it's above\neverything else, this loop also feels a bit like the loop on Black\nKnight 2000.  (But in No Fear it's the left orbit that lights\nextra ball after repeated shots; the jumps mainly just score\npoints.)\n\nSkydive Drop Target\n    Simple drop target which blocks the entrance to the Skydive\nlane. Shooting this target lights lock at Skydive and Skull\n(see multiball section). The target drops automatically when\nthe ball is plunged as the plunger lane is aimed at Skydive,\nand when you start Air Challenge.  The \"drop target in front of\na short lane\" is reminiscent of T2's skull shot, but in No Fear\nthe Skull is over a different shot, and the lane is longer.\n\nSkydive Lane\n    Short lane with a scoop at the end. One of the major shots used\nby the challenges, and can also be lit for Jackpot and Lock.\nWhen a ball is plunged, the skydive drop target drops temporarily\n(if it was up) and the lock/jackpot is temporarily turned off (if\nit was on) and the ball (usually) goes into the skydive scoop.\nWhen the ball goes in here, it is returned at the right inlane.\n\nTrack Orbit (left)\n    Left side of Skull and orbits around the back of his head to exit\nvia the right Track orbit which is aimed at the left flipper. Apart\nfrom the Track arrow light, there are three Steering Wheel lights\n(1st, 2nd & 3rd) in front of this shot.  The two sides of the track\norbit count as the same shot.  The track orbit is somewhat like\nthe U-turn on BK2K, although it is in a different location -- both\nare short, tight orbits.\n\nSkull\n    The only real gimmick on this game, and even then it is only a\nplastic skull with a hinged jaw which sits above a scoop and\ntalks to you. Other than the talking, the actual skull serves no\npurpose so if it breaks, game play will not be affected.\n\nSkull's jaw is one of the few things obscured (from the usual\nplayer's position) by the jump ramp; some players might never\nnotice it moves unless they look for it, and reportedly it often\nbreaks, though I have yet to see a broken one.\n\nJust below Skull's jawbone is a scoop which can be lit for Ball\nLock, Jackpot, Extra Ball and Start Challenge.\n\nWhen the ball goes in here, it is returned at the right inlane.\n\nTrack Orbit (right)\n    The other side of Skull. A ball entering the orbit this side flies\naround the back of Skull and exits on the left which is aimed at\nthe right flipper. The only light in front of this shot is a Track\narrow.\n\nHairpin Ramp\n    A shallow ramp to the right of the Track orbit which feeds to the\nright inlane via a habitrail. Can be lit for Down Hill, Win, Right\nTurn and Super Cross Start.  This ramp and the jump ramp are\nreminiscent of the 2 ramps in T2, and you can even start Payback\nTime by repeated alternating shots on the two ramps.\n\nSummit Orbit\n    To the right of the Hairpin ramp, this is the other end of the\nScreamer orbit. A ball entering here orbits around the back of the\nplayfield and exits at Screamer heading for the left flipper. Can be\nlit for a Hurry Up.  There are some awards that can be given for\nhitting this loop, including super spinner and light video mode.\n\nCliff Standups\n    A couple of targets located just above the entrance gate from the\nplunger lane. Shoot these to light the Kickback, and advance meters\ntowards \"Jump This.\"\n\nRight Inlane\n    Reverse version of the left inlane which can be lit to start Hurry\nUp, and always lights the Raceway on the left orbit.  Balls from\nthe skull and skydive shots are returned to play here, and a spare\nball is usually held here to help speed things up.\n\nRight Outlane\n    Nothing particularly special about this one either except that the\npost positioning could make it either quite nasty or quite nice\ndepending upon the setting. This can be lit for Jump This. As with\nthe left, there is no rubber at the top of the In/Outlane divider.\n\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nStartup/Skill Shot\nAs is the norm these days, No Fear is a mode based game. These modes are\ncalled Challenges (see later) and basically have some adrenalin-pumping\nsport associated with them.  As a general rule of thumb, shoot the flashing\narrow should be a fairly effective strategy, but I'll discuss strategies\nlater.\n\nStarting a game is just like ST:TNG; one of five features will be started\nwhen you fire the old silver sphere. These are:\n\n Start Challenge\n Super Cross Level\n Advance Raceway\n Ball Lock\n Flipper Skill Shot\n\n\nThey automatically cycle but can be speeded up by the flippers. To\nscore the Skill Shot, you have to make the Jump Ramp for 50M.\n\nThere are a couple of things to note here: Firstly, when you have an EB\nand the game is going through its 'Shoot Again' animation, it is still\ncycling the plunger options so that if (like me) you watch the animation\nthen plunge, you are probably going to get Super Cross Level and not\nStart Challenge which can be really annoying.  According to Matt Coriale,\nthis is fixed in the latest ROMs.\n\nSecondly, Start Challenge is not available if either Lock 3 is lit\n(i.e. start Multiball) or if the next challenge is one of the last three.\nFurthermore, Lock Ball is not lit if it would be the third ball locked.\n\nIn very early ROMs, the Skill Shot choices start with 'Start Challenge'\neven if it is not supposed to be offered, but when it starts cycling\nthrough the choices, it never returns to it.  If you choose it when it\nis not supposed to be lit, you may not get it, anyway.\n\nMinor Challenges\nThere are 8 challenges which I'll break down into 5 minor, 2 major and a\nFinal Challenge. The general principle behind each one is that it is a\ntimed mode in which you have to shoot the flashing arrows. Usually, one\nof the shots has a special function. They can all be started via the\nplunger Start Challenge option or by shooting the Skull scoop when lit.\nNote that the scoop is always lit when you are not playing a Challenge,\nunless the third lock is lit there instead (starting Multiball) or if\nyou need to spell \"No Fear\" to light it (see \"Major Challenges\").\n\nThe minor challenges are as follows:\n\nNote that where you see C: & S: below, these are quotes from the\ncommentator and Skull (Bone Head).\n\nDirt Challenge\nC: Welcome to off road racing.\nWha' d'you say BoneHead?\nS: Shoot the ramps to score big.\n\nThis is a 30 sec mode during which you shoot the ramps for points.\nValue starts at 5M per ramp and every shot (ramps, loops, etc.)\nadvances that by 5M to a max of 20M, although only the ramps award\nthe points.\n\nThere's a nice animation of a truck crashing through a gate when\nyou hit a ramp; the gate is labeled \"Checkpoint XX\" before the\ntruck hits it, where XX is the number of ramps hit in this mode\nso far.  The jump loop counts as a ramp in this mode, and also\ngives the usual 5/10/15/20/25M scoring for jumps.\n\nRob Chesnavich pushed this mode past 100 checkpoints with the\nglass off, and there seemed to be no limit.\n\nAsphalt Challenge\nC: Welcome to Nascar Racing with Robbie Gordon.\nTell 'em how to do it BoneHead.\nS: Shoot the track to win the race.\n\nShoot the Track arrows to orbit Skull, or shoot the Skull scoop\nitself and score 50M, 75M and 100M. Mode ends after three orbits\nhave been made, or the timer runs out (30sec?). During this round,\nthe normal Steering Wheel awards are not advanced; the lights for\nSteering Wheel are used to indicate how many shots you have made in\nthis mode.  If you shoot the jump ramp in this mode, the magnets\ndivert the ball to the left flipper.  If Skull isn't too busy saying\nsomething else, he says \"Second place is the first loser!\" after\nthe second shot.\n\nWater Challenge\nC: Water Skiing with Sammy Duvall.\nSkull?\nS: Shoot the tube for more time and bigger points.\n\nThis is a lot like Time Rift from Star Trek TNG.\n\nTimer starts at 30/25/20(?) secs and counts down. Shoot the flashing\narrows for points, and shoot the Tube saucer to increase the amount\nof time left and the amount the lit shots are worth. Mode ends when\nthe timer runs out.\n\nInitially, the shots are worth 10M with each shot to the Tube adding\n5M to each shot and 10 seconds to the timer, but the timer will never\nexceed 30 seconds, and once you have maxed out the shots at 30M, you\ncannot add more time, either.\n\nWhen the time is running out, the commentator yells at you to shoot\nthe tube.\n\nThere are some great quotes when you hit shots in this mode\n(like \"This guy's insane\", \"He's nuts\", etc.) but I don't have\na list of them.\n\nSnow Challenge\nC: It's extreme skiing with Glenn Plake.\nHow about it BoneHead?\nS: Shoot the Downhill to win.\n\nA 30 sec timer starts and you have to shoot the Down Hill to end\nthe mode. During this mode, a shot to the Jumps Ramp will be\nstopped by the magnets and fed to the left habitrail so you are\nset up for the Hairpin Ramp. The Jump ramp and the Summit each\nscore 10M and add 10M to the value of the Hairpin ramp which is\ninitially 50M and maxes out at 100M.\nAir Challenge\nC: It's a beautiful day for skydiving.\nTell 'em how to do it BoneHead.\nS: Shoot the Skydive\nDiver: Wait a minute! I've never done this before!  How do I do it?\nWhere's-the-rip-cord? I-wanna-go-back! [something else spoken\nreally fast]\nS: Shut up and JUMP!\n\nDrop target at the entrance to Skydive lock is lowered and a\ncountdown from 25M starts, it stops at 10M if you haven't hit\nthe skydive by that time.  Shoot Skydive to freeze the countdown\nafter which the arrows are lit for that amount. You have 30 secs\nin which to make all the shots and collect 75M for doing so.\n\nThe shots are: Tube, Left Orbit, Jump Ramp, Skydive, Track Orbit\n(the two sides count as only one shot), Skull, Hairpin Ramp, and\nRight Orbit.\n\nThis is just like Asteroid Threat on ST:TNG.\n\nAlso read the \"Easter Eggs\" section for info about this mode.\n\nNote that these challenges can be played in any order. Whenever Start\nChallenge is lit, the next one to be played is indicated by the lights in\nthe center of the playfield just above the flippers.  The slingshots change\nthe lit mode.  Another point to note is that the timers for the modes are\nstopped if no switches are closed within a certain time which prevents you\nfrom trapping a ball and letting the Challenge time out.\n\nAn interesting point about the quotes for the modes is that they are not\nentirely fixed. The first line the commentator says is always the same,\nas is the response from skull. However, the second line the commentator\nsays which asks Skull to tell you how to do it is a random selection\nfrom a list. See the section on quotes for more info.\nMajor Challenges\nThe major challenges follow a similar pattern, but you need to spell No Fear\nbefore Start Challenge will light to start the second one. There are two of\nthem as follows:\nNo Limits\nS: No Limits. Everything is lit.\nC: Add a million for every shot you make.\n\nThis is a 3 ball multiball with a 15 second ball saver.\nAll major shots are lit for 20M and each one collected adds 1M to\nthe amount they are worth.  Unlike the name implies, the mode does\nin fact max out, at 70M per shot.  It ends when less than two balls\nare in play.\nFear Fest\nS: Welcome to the Fear Fest.\nC: Good Luck!\nS: You don't need luck if you're good.\n\nAnother 3 ball multiball where the objective is to shoot Skull or\nSkydive for the Fear Fest Jackpot. The value of this starts at 80M\nand each major shot adds 20M to this value. Once it has been\ncollected, Jackpot resets to 20M and 4 major shots are needed\nto relight it making the second jackpot start at 100M (20M plus\n20M each for the 4 major shots).  This one has a 25 second ball\nsaver.  There's no apparent limit to the size of the jackpot.\n\nMark Phaedrus comments that this is similar to cryoprison multiball\nin Demolition Man.\n\nNote that Fear Fest is not immediately lit after No Limits\ncompletes. Instead, you have to complete 'No Fear' by shooting\nthe various loops/ramps to light it and then shoot Skull to\nstart.\n\nAnd of course, there is the Final Challenge:\nMeet Your Maker\nS:  \"It's time to Meet Your Maker!  And I'm driving!\"\nC:  \"Thanks, skull-boy, I'm outta here!\"\n\nThis is a four ball multiball in which all switches are worth\n250k.  50M jackpot is lit at Skull, 200M jackpot is lit for Jump\nLoops, EB is lit, Super Spinner is lit, Hurry up is lit, raceway\norbit is maxed out at 25M, 20 sec ball saver and so on.\nBasically, everything is lit ...:)\n\nPayback Time is not started, but the first two supercross levels\nare completed, so you only need to shoot each ramp once to start it.\n\nThe 200M jackpot stays lit during MYM, so if you catch some balls\non the left flipper, and shoot jump loops with the right flippers\nwith one other ball, you can really rack up some points.\n\nThis mode ends when less than 2 balls are in play and (like Fear\nTest) you need to spell 'No Fear' to light Start Challenge to get\ninto this mode.\n\nThe first time you hit the Skull or Skydive after this mode ends,\na new ball will be plunged, because the ball that is usually\nstored in the feed to the right inlane is used as one of the\n4 balls in this mode.\nOther Game Features\nThere are numerous other play features which are not specifically tied into\nmodes as such and these are listed below in no particular order:\n\n\nSuper Cross Ramps\n    Shoot alternate Jumps/Hairpin ramps to start Payback Time.\nShooting them as a combo (one right after the other) scores\n15M, and if the combo is right ramp followed by jump ramp,\nthe magnets will grab the ball for you to keep going.\nLights on the playfield in front of each ramp mark your\nprogress; you need 3 shots on each ramp, alternating, to\nstart Payback Time.\n\nPayback Time\n    All the major shots are lit for 25M for 25 seconds.\n\nTube Shot\n    Shoot the Tube saucer to collect a random award. These include:\n\n    Advance Raceway (just like a single shot of left orbit.  If you\nneed more than one orbit, this just helps you get there)\n    Autofire (30 sec ball saver)\n    Extra Ball\n    Kickback Lit\n    Light Extra Ball\n    Light Return Lanes\n    Lock Awarded\n    Lock Lit\n    MK3 Hint (*)\n    Multiball\n    Over-The-Edge\n    Start Challenge (if you have it lit, even on the last 3 modes,\nyou can get Start Challenge)\n    Start Hurry Up\n    Summit Award\n    Supercross Level (like a l/r or r/l ramp shot)\n    Video Mode start\n    20 Million\n    200 Meters\n\n\n(*) According to Matt Coriale, this is awarded, very rarely.\nIn some roms (the first ones to have the dice-rolling match\nsequence) this was replaced with \"All of the above\" but it was\nswitched back due to it being too good when it was awarded, and\nconflicts between some things starting at the same time.  Some\npeople were doubting that it was ever awarded, because they\ndidn't know anybody who had ever seen it awarded.\n\nSummit Loop\n    A build up counter which awards certain things at various points\n(just like the left ramp on ST:TNG).  Consecutive shots may be\nrequired to get some of these, and these are only awarded while\nyou are not playing a challenge or multiball.\nAwards:\n\n            5 Million\n            Light Video Mode\n            Super Spinner\n            10 Million\n            (10 Million for each shot thereafter)\n\nThis list is reset at the start of each ball.\n\nRaceway\n    This is exactly like the Freeway on Getaway. Five consecutive\nshots are worth 5M, 10M, 15M, 20M, and light Extra Ball at Skull.\nAfter EB is lit, subsequent Raceways are worth 25M each.\n\nYou can only light one extra ball this way per ball.\nAlso, it requires more hits while lit to advance to the next\nRaceway value each time you complete this by lighting the extra\nball; the 2nd extra ball requires 2 loops while lit to advance\neach level, the 3rd requires 3 loops, etc.  I haven't heard of\nanybody getting more than 3 EB's in a game this way.\n\nRaceway value starts at 10M, 15M or 20M on each ball (this is\nreflexed to try to meet the extra ball percentage the game is\nset for) until you get the first EB; afterward it always resets\nat 5M between balls.\n\nClimber Award\n    By hitting the cliff standups, you can be awarded 100 meters towards\na climber award for each two hits.  You can hit the same target twice\nor hit each target once to get the 100 meters.  Some other things may\nalso award meters -- one of the Tube awards is 200 meters.  You need\n400 meters to climb the first mountain.  Climbing a mountain is worth\n30M points and lights Jump This in an outlane, and you start over\nat the bottom of the next mountain, which is 500 meters higher (so\nthe second is 900 meters, the third 1400, increasing until the 9th\nmountain; it and all subsequent mountains are 4000 meters).  Note\nthat the \"meters\" used in calculating the end-of-ball bonus is a\ncumulative total of all your meters over the game, not just where\nyou are on the current mountain.  Jump This doesn't stack; if it's\nalready lit when you complete a mountain, you just get 30M.\n\nJump This\n    A feature that is lit at the outlanes via the Climber Award.\nWhen collected, a new ball is launched, and the left ramp\nand Jump loops are lit for 30M each during a 30 sec timer.\nNote that this is effectively a ballsaver for any outlane\ndrains; if the ball is saved anyway (as with the kickback)\nthen this is a 2-ball multiball.\n\nNote also, that nothing else in the game runs during JUMP THIS!\n\nOver The Edge\n    Two ball Multiball in which Jump Ramp and Hairpin are worth\na base 25M with an additional 10M for each ramp made, but maxes\nout at 75M per shot. This can be worth a huge number of points\nand is started by making 1st place for the third time (see below),\nor from a random Tube award.  This seems to be awarded fairly\noften from the Tube. The magnets divert Jump Ramp shots to the\nflipper, so you can't shoot jump loops to really rack up the score.\n\n1st, 2nd, 3rd Place\nAs noted in the playfield description, there are three steering\nwheel lights below the left Track Orbit - these denote your\nplace in the race (what race I don't know).\n\nInitially, none are lit. Shooting the Track Orbit will advance\nyour placing and award the following:\n\n            3rd Place       15M\n            2nd Place       25M\n            1st Place: different awards each time:\n\n                  1: Light Return Lanes for Hurry Up\n                  2: Light Extra Ball\n                  3: Over The Edge\n                  4: 30 Million Points\n                  5: Light Return Lanes\n              6,7,8: 40 Million\n                  9: Light Return Lanes\n           10,11,12: 50 Million\n                 13: Light Return Lanes\n           14,15,16: 60 Million\n                 17: Light Return Lanes\n              18,19: 70 Million\n                 20: 100 Million\n\n\n\nRob Chesnavich did some work with the glass off to come up with\nthis list.  This mostly agrees with everything I have heard except\nthat some people say it keeps giving 30M.  This may be a harder\nsetting.  BTW, after the 20th first-place award, the track orbit\nshuts down, and stays at 3rd place for the rest of the game.\n\nVideo Mode\n    I'm not a big fan of video modes on pinballs, and this one has\ndone nothing to improve that feeling. It is a pretty lame one\nwhich has a motorcyclist traveling along a track and steered\nvia the flippers. Along the track are various jumps with a point\nvalue above them; use the jumps to steer the motorbike through\nthe points to collect them (they change shade/colour if you have\nhit them). There is a 25M bonus for completing the course.\n\nWhen you start video mode, you are told which track you are\non including: Daytona, Anaheim & Silverstone. the reason for the\ndifferent tracks is to make it harder to learn the patterns for\nthe VM.\n\nEnd of Ball Bonus\n    At the end of each ball, you get a bonus that depends on features\ncompleted throughout the game, as in BK2K.  The bonus is:\n\n            5M for each jump loop (max 200)\n           10M for each challenge started (no limit?)\n            1M for each 100 meters climbed (no limit?)\n\n\nMultiball\nPossibly one of the better scoring possibilities in this game is the\nregular Multiball. This is a three ball job which starts as soon as\nthe third ball lock shot is made.\n\nTo light lock, you have to shoot the Skydive drop target once, and\nthen shoot either Skydive, or Skull to lock the ball. Ball Lock is also\nan option when you start a new ball at the plunger - this automatically\nlowers the drop target and fires the ball into Skydive.\n\nUpon locking the third ball, the display shows an animation of a number\nof motorcycles taking off from the starting grid in a race and then\nthree balls are pumped into play. The objective is to score jackpots\nwhich are lit and collected in the following order:\n\n\nSkull scoop   50M \nSkydive scoop 100M\nJump Loop     200M\n\n\nRepeat until less than 2 balls are in play.  You may be able to get credit\nfor the Jump Loop by sending 2 balls up the jump ramp in quick succession.\nOn some machines this may even be possible outside of multiball.\n\nJump loops also score 25M (instead of the usual 5/10/15...) when not\ngiving the super jackpot 200M.\n\nIf you manage to get down to 1 ball without even hitting the Skull for\nthe first jackpot, there's a 'Last Chance' -- all jackpots are lit\nfor 10 to 20 seconds (varies between different machines).  In my\nexperience, each one stays lit until the timer runs out or until you hit\nit once.  Other people have reported having all the jackpots go out when\nyou hit one (so the obvious strategy is to shoot the jump for the super\njackpot).\n\nSubsequent multiballs perform the same way, but are somewhat harder to\nstart. The second time around, you have to hit the drop target to light\nlock for each ball, and third time the same applies but now you can\nonly lock in the Skydive hole.\n\nWhen the third lock is lit, you cannot start Challenges (the skull starts\nMultiball instead).  If you start Multiball during a Challenge, the\nChallenge and its timer stops, and continues when Multiball is over.\nPlaying Strategies\nI'm open to suggestions here. I find the best bet is to Start Challenge\nwith each ball, and make a special effort to exploit the Raceway for EB's.\nDoing this, multiball seems to just happen naturally and I can (rarely)\nget a decent score.  The major challenges are worth a lot of points.\n\nAn alternative is to always choose supercross level, so you are guaranteed\nto get payback time, but I find payback time easy enough to get anyway.\n\nIf in doubt, the old favourite 'Shoot the flashing arrow' should work\npretty well, and there is probably something to be said for the Flipper\nSkill Shot if you know you can hit that ramp.\n\nAnother effective strategy during multiball(s) is to trap a ball on the\nleft flipper, and exploit the left ramp/Jump This loop.  The Jump loop\nmay be good in general, since each jump adds 5M to your bonus for every\nball for the rest of the game.  Outside of multiball, each jump scores\nat least 5M, with 5/10/15/20/25M for consecutive jumps (max of 25M).\nDuring multiball, jumps are always worth 25M.\n\nThere's also the Payback Time during Multiball strategy, as with T2.\nMatt Coriale suggests trying to get Payback Time and Over The Edge\nrunning together.\nQuotes\nNo Fear is a very talkative game. In most cases the quotes are easy\nto understand and very useful.\n\nThe dialogue is basically done as a commentary between two observers of\nvarious sports; Skull (or BoneHead) and another commentator, and blends\nin with the game extremely well. Congrats to the programming team on a\njob extremely well done (IMHO at least :)  The voice for the skull is\napparently done by Steve Ritchie himself.\n\nAt the start of a ball:\nSkull:  Prepare for the ride of your life.\nPlayer [n] step up.\n\nDuring Snow Challenge:\nSkull:  Shoot the Downhill\n\n[This is pretty incessant - bit like 'Shoot the Transporter'!]\n\nAfter shooting jumps and/or outer loops:\nSkull:  Amazing!\nCommentator:  Righteous!\nOutstanding!\nFaster!\nSmokin'!\nDo it again!\n\n[Skull has an annoying tendency to say \"Do it again!\" after you've just\nmade the last outer loop needed to light extra ball, before he gets\naround to telling you the extra ball is lit.]\n\nAfter shooting roughly 6 or more consecutive jumps:\nSkull:  Aaaaaagggghhhhhhhh!!!!\nObviously, you have _No_ _Fear_.\n[The scream also is used at the start of Meet Your Maker.]\n[Thanks to Russel Willoughby for this spelling of the scream. :-) ]\n\nAs appropriate:\nS/C:    Jackpot!\nSkull:  Extra Ball is lit.\nSkull:  Extra Ballllllll!\n\nAfter lighting 2nd place on the steering wheel award, or after hitting\nthe second shot in Asphalt mode:\nSkull:  Second Place is the First Loser!\nSkull:  Go for the Win!\nI've also heard this during asphalt mode:\nCommentator: He's going for a new world record!\n\nDuring the buy-in timer, if your score is second place on a high score list\nSkull:  Second Place is the First Loser!\n\nDuring Jump This:\nCrowd:  Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! ...\n\nAfter tilting:\nSkull:  It's only pinball!\nSkull:  No way! (in BK2K voice, Steve Ritchie either way :-)\nSkull:  Get a spine!\n\nAfter losing the ball (mainly on outlane drains, when there is more time):\nSkull:  Crash and burn.\n[others]\n\nAfter losing the ball when autofire gives it back:\nSkull:  Play better!\n[others]\n\nWhen pressing flipper buttons in attract mode:\nSkull:  Hey bucko!\nSkull:  Hey!\nSkull:  Don't be a spectator!\n\nIn multiplayer games, when one player's score passes another (if it's not\ntoo busy saying other stuff):\nCommentator:  There's a new leader, and it's player two!\nCommentator:  Player three has moved into second place.\n\nIn the sound test, but not apparent in the game:\n\"I thought we were pals.\"\n(I'd imagine this has something to do with shooting the\nskull, as this is what Rudy says in Funhouse sometimes when\nthe ball hits him in the jaw.)\n\"Water!\"\n\"Air!\"\n\"Snow!\"\nThese are spoken very loudly, with an echo.  Weird.\nTechnical Notes\nHardware:\n\nThe cabinet for No Fear is of standard width with nothing out of the\nordinary attached. There is a regular flipper button on either side,\nthe Start and EB buyin buttons at the front on the left, and the\nplunger button at the front on the right. Power switch (for those who\nreally care) is located in the usual spot under the cabinet on the right.\nFour balls are installed.\n\nThe hardware is really pretty basic; a few habitrails, ramps, lanes and\na distinct lack of flash gadgets which might cause potential problems and\nI noticed that the inlanes were back to good old rollovers as\nopposed to proximity switches. Also worth noting is that the Tube saucer\nis very solid and invariably retains balls that land in it (unlike\nStart Mode on Indy!)\n\nOf interest, if little value, is that the Cliff Standups are apparently\nmounted upside down. Also, there are no pop bumpers!\n\nIt seems No Fear keeps track of 100B+ scores, but does not display the\nhundred-billions.  Rob Chesnavich says after reaching 100B, the score\ndisplay showed leading zeroes (i.e., 00,123,456,780)\n\nThere is only one item whose failure might affect the game, and that is\nthe trio of magnets incorporated into the Jumps Loop. They are used\nto help the ball up the ramp, or stop it as appropriate, and to keep it\ngoing around the Jumps Loop. If they die, a major feature will be lost\nalthough I doubt that it would be disastrous to play.  See below in\n\"Magnet Problems\".\n\nMagnet problems:\n\nSome people have reported that on early No Fears the magnets were too\nstrong, heat from the coils would eventually melt the plastic of the\nramp above it. Later roms fixed this.\n\nA problem with the magnets has developed on some No Fear machines commonly\nreferred to as the Infinite Loop bug.  When the magnets are trying to pull\nthe ball up the ramp, it is possible for the ball to not make it through\nthe gate. When this happens, when the ball trips the opto again on the way\ndown, the magnets pull it back up, but again it fails to get through the\ngate.  This continues, essentially forever.\n\nThere is supposed to be a fix for this in newer roms.\nEaster Eggs and other Nice Stuff\nThe biggest surprise I had when I first encountered this game came\nfrom the attract mode which displays:\n\nEmail suggestions/comments to nofear@wms.com\n\nThis is legit although you only get an automated reply thanking you\nfor your interest. I assume that these messages are read and that\nanything of true value to the design team is acknowledged.\n\nCameron Silver discovered this button code:\nBLLLLLLLLRLLLLLRLLLLLRLLLLLLRR  (the same code as STTNG's game logos)\nwhich shows on the display:\nPut your 3D glasses on now.\nIf you use this during a game, then some of the stuff on the DMD will\n\"flitter\" (or something) for that game, but it seems nobody really knows\nwhat to make out of this.  I tried playing a game, hitting the code at\nthe beginning, and wearing 3-D glasses for the whole game, but except\nfor the red/orange lights vs. blue areas of the playfield, I didn't see\nany 3-D effect.  It looked kinda cool, but the flickering DMD didn't\ndo much for it.\n\nIf you hold down the extra ball button at the beginning of Air challenge,\nand hit the skydive while holding it down and while it's still at 25M,\nyou get 50M instead, and an MK3 hint.  Skull says \"Congratulations.\"\nI am told that in MK3, there is a secret \"move\" which doesn't do anything,\nbut displays the message \"NO FEAR - EB BUTTON, SKYDIVE, MAX COUNTDOWN.\"\nThe MK3 Hint screen had \"MK3 Hint\" in big letters with 6 boxes below it,\nand there was a picture (a face?) in the 3rd box.\nCows\nLike most Williams games, there's a cow in No Fear.  If you get a high\nscore and enter the initials MOO, Skull will say \"Moooo!\" after you get\nthe credit(s) from the high score.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "No Fear", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/nofear.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: No Fear", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

They are:\n\n Left orbit\n Left ramp\n Center ramp\n Right ramp\n Right orbit\n\n\nStarting with the flippers and going approximately counter-clockwise:\n\n\nFlippers  2 fairly normal Williams flippers.\n\nSlingshots  2 fairly normal slingshots.\n\nLeft inlanes  There are 2 of them.  The leftmost left inlane lights the\nright orbit for the next orbit award and is the return path for the\nleft and center ramps.  I'm not sure what the right left inlane does,\nif anything.  Either will lower the driving range ramp if lit.\n\nLeft outlane  There's a kickback here!  First Lawlor game with a kickback\nsince his first, Banzai Run.  Can be lit for extra ball.\n\nSand Trap kicker  A small saucer above the curve for the left outlane\nkickback.  You can't really shoot this directly, most of the time\nballs will just bounce into it.\n\nSand Trap standup  Just to the right of the saucer, it's what lights the\nSand Trap kicker.\n\nJet Bumpers  3 jet bumpers, not quite in a triangle, more above each other.\nGenerally, you'll only get action between 2 bumpers at a time.  The\nbumpers generally increase the Sand Trap value.\n\nAdvance Jet Bumpers standup  A little blue standup just to the left of the\nleft orbit entrance.  Each hit advances one Jet Bumper.  See the\nbumpers section for more details.\n\nLeft orbit  Called the Cart Path by the game usually.  Usually goes all the\nway around the back of the game to the upper right flipper.  Weak\nshots may fall into the back of the Putting Green.\n\nLeft spinner  A fairly standard shiny spinner.\n\nCaptive ball  A dummy fixture in front guards a regular pinball with a short\npath with a switch in it (like the TOM setup, but a much shorter ball\npath).  It lies just to the right of the left orbit entrance.\n\nDriving Range ramp  A fairly wide ramp (about 2-3 pinball widths) that is\nusually UP.  When activated (lowered), you can shoot the ramp to\naccess targets above the normal ramps.\n\nSkill Shot targets  Just above the playfield from the Driving Range ramp and\njust below the entrance to the left ramp.\n\nLeft ramp  Very much like TAF's left ramp.  Scores Jackpots and pretty much\nalways lights the left inlane for an immediate Driving Range shot.\nYou can usually plunge the ball directly up the ramp instead of\naiming for the Skill Shot targets.  Feeds to the left left inlane.\n\nPutting Green  A big hole in the back left of the playfield.  You can shoot\nit from either of the right flippers.  Also, there is a hole behind\nthe putting green so that slow-rolling balls in the orbit can also\nscore the Putting Green.  Balls are usually kicked out into the Jet\nBumpers, but it can also be kicked out high-speed to the right\nflipper.  Extra ball can be lit here.\n\nDriving Range  This is basically a clear sheet of plastic above the\nplayfield.  It is only accessible via the Driving Range ramp.  The\nball can hit the Cart, Hole-In-One, center ramp, or dribble off to\nthe left into the left orbit or off the bottom of the range back onto\nthe center of the playfield.\n\nGolf Cart  Just a big plastic golf cart-looking thing with a couple of\nstand-up targets on it.  You can hit it from either bottom flipper\noff the Driving Range ramp.\n\nCenter ramp  Pretty much right in the middle of the playfield in the back.\nThis (and the right ramp) can have 3 states:  Down, so you can shoot\nthe ramp; up, so you can shoot under the ramp; up with a gofer, so\nyou can smack the gofer.  Bud lives under the center ramp.  The ramp\nitself is generally only makable from the left flipper, but Bud can\nbe hit from all 3, and under the ramp from the bottom flippers\n(sometimes the top flipper with a little help).  Feeds to the left\nleft inlane.  If you shoot under the ramp, it goes to the Putting\nGreen and can be kicked out into the Jet Bumpers or the right\nflipper.\n\nHole-In-One  The hardest shot in the game (and not surprisingly, probably\nthe most important).  It is on the Driving Range, and basically drops\ndown between the center and right ramps.  There is a little mini-ramp\non top of the driving range that blocks the shot a bit.  It is still\npossible to shoot a ball onto the driving range and up the mini-ramp,\nbut a lot of shots are just ricochets off of the Golf Cart.\n\nRight ramp  Right next to the center ramp.  Pretty much everything under the\ncenter ramp applies to the right ramp, except that Buzz lives under\nthe right ramp.  It feeds the right inlane.  If you shoot under the\nramp, it kicks out to the right orbit for a slow upper-right flipper\nfeed.\n\nRight orbit  Very similar to the left orbit, but it's on the right, see.\nIt's \"entrance\" is quite a bit higher up on playfield (next to the\nright ramp).\n\nRight spinner  Another spinner, exactly like the left spinner.  Just a bit\nup from the orbit entrance.\n\nUpper right flipper  Just a normal flipper, in about the same position as\nTAF's.  You can shoot the left ramp, Putting Green, and the Gofers\nwith it.\n\nPlunger lane exit  Just under the upper right flipper.  Slow plunger shots\ngo into the skill shot standups, hard ones go up the left ramp.\n\nPlunger  A combo plunger.\n\nKICK standups  There are 5 standup targets, one for each letter of KICK\nwhich face the upper left of the playfield, and one that faces the\nleft flipper.\n\nWheel  Just a bit to the right of the Driving Range ramp, it serves a couple\npurposes.  First of all, it indicates what you'll get as a reward for\nfinishing the current hole (pointed to by the yellow arrow at the\nbottom of the wheel).  Secondly, it has a special \"grabby\" surface so\nit can interfere with the ball path when spinning (much like\nWhirlwind's spinners).\n\nRight outlane  Can be lit for special.\n\nRight inlane  Lights the left orbit.\n\n\nGameplay\nSkill Shot\nThe Skill Shot is available to you at the start of each ball, extra ball, and\nafter any lock that serves a ball to the plunger.  You have a choice:  You\ncan pull the plunger hard, and the ball will go up the left ramp (and collect\nanything if it's lit on there) and to the left left inlane for a free Driving\nRange shot.  Obviously you can potentially get a Hole-In-One.  You can also\nplunge fairly lightly and aim for the Skill Shot targets.  If you hit these,\nyou get 750K+250K each one (don't know of a limit yet) as well as light the\nPutting Green for the current hole (if it isn't already).\n\nThere is a 5-second or so ballsaver at the start of each ball.\nCart Paths\nBetween the flippers are 6 lights, which indicate the next Cart Path award.\nCart Path awards are given when you shoot an orbit after lighting it from the\nright inlane (for the left orbit) or the left left inlane (for the right\norbit).  The awards are:\n\n Bonus 2x\n Increase Cart Path\n Bonus 3x\n Increase Cart path\n Bonus 4x\n Bonus 5x + Light extra ball\n\n\nThe flashing award indicates what you'll get next.  The awards reset at the\nstart of every ball.  It doesn't look like you get anything extra after you\nget 5x + light extra ball.  You only get one Cart Path award per inlane\ntrigger.  You can only get the extra ball from Cart Paths once.\n\nOrbits score 50K+50K for each consecutive shot.  I believe getting \"Increase\nCart Path\" bumps up the base value by 50K (i.e. 100K+50K/shot and 150K+50K/\nshot).  That resets each ball as well.\n\nEach orbit has a big white circle light that flashes when it's lit for the\nnext Cart Path award or for consecutive loop awards.\nKickback\nThe default is for the kickback to be lit at the start of the game.  You can\nlight the kickback by completing the KICK lights or by a Wheel Award.  You\ncan even STACK kickbacks!  Newer ROMs should tell you in the status report\nhow many kickbacks you have lit.\n\nThe KICK targets are aligned like this:\n\n\n     K\\\n    I /\n   C /\n  K /\n   /\n\n\nNot at that extreme of an angle, but close.  You can't hit the KICK standups\ndirectly from the left flipper, but there is a 5th that faces the flipper you\ncan hit.  To complete KICK, you need to hit each KICK standup twice. The\nfirst hit flashes the letter, the second hit turns it solid. Hitting the\nstandup that faces the left flipper spots one hit on one target, so if you\nhave only 1 flashing letter left and the ball on the left flipper, shoot the\nspot standup to finish KICK.\n\nThe default is to let only 1 kickback be \"stacked\" on an already-lit\nkickback.\nSand Trap\nThe Sand Trap value starts the game at around 100K.  The Jet Bumpers add\naround 2.5K/hit to the value (maybe more if they're lit or flashing?), and\nthe Skill Shot targets can add some too (I think).  The Sand Trap starts the\ngame lit.  When the ball goes into the saucer, your Sand Trap value will\nstart counting down like a hurry-up award.  The letters in KICK will start to\nlight up one-at-a-time, like the T2 skill shot or Judge Dredd Air Raid.  Your\ngoal is to hit the left flipper button so that the ball, when ejected from\nthe saucer, will shoot across the playfield and hit the lit standup.  If you\nhit the lit standup, you'll collect the remaining Sand Trap value.  I think\nthe value continues to go up from where you collected it.  If you miss, you\ndon't get the points, but you still continue building in up from the same\npoint.\n\nIf the Sand Trap is unlit, hit the wide yellow standup to the right of the\nsaucer to light it.\nJet Bumpers\nThe Jet Bumpers have 3 states:  Off, lit, and flashing.  Normally, each ball\nstarts with the middle bumper lit.  The Advance Jets standup increases one\nbumper's level.  When all 3 bumpers are flashing, you have Super Jets for the\nrest of the ball (7.5K/hit I think).  Hitting the Advance Jets standup when\nSuper Jets are lit scores 50K.  The Jets also add to the Sand Trap value.\n\nYou can get Super Jets as a Wheel Award, too.\nCaptive Ball\nThere are 5 lights on the captive ball:\n\n\nDrive  Spots a drive for the current hole.  If Putting Green is already lit,\nprobably doesn't do much of anything.\n\nIncrease Bud Value  Adds 25K to Bud's award (for the rest of the game).\n\nIncrease Buzz Value  Adds 25K to Buzz's award (for the rest of the game)\n\nIncrease Cart Value  Adds 100K to the Cart's value (for the rest of the\ngame)\n\nLight Driving Range  Lights the left inlanes for some free shots at the\ndriving range the first time.  The 2nd time it awards Ripoff\nMultiball.\n\n\nThere's also \"Collect Ripoff\" lights on either side of the \"Drive\" light.\n\nThe game starts with Drive flashing, and every hit collects the current award\nand lights the next one.  The captive ball does NOT reset at the start of\neach ball, it is held throughout the game.\nLeft ramp\nEvery shot to the left ramp adds 100K to the Hole-In-One value (which starts\nthe game at 400K I think).  Also, the inlane will lower the Driving Range\nramp after each shot to the left ramp.\nDriving Range\nThe Driving Range value starts at around 50K and is increased by 25K or so\nwith each center and right ramp shot.  If you shoot the Driving Range and\nmake the center ramp instead of hitting the Cart or Hole-In-One (or missing\nentirely), you score the Driving Range value.  Often times you'll see an\nanimation of a squirrel getting hit by or swallowing a golf ball.  (Buzz:\n\"Hey! Don't hit my tree-dwelling cousin!\")  There's also a car's window that\ngets hit (complete with car alarm going off :) ) and probably a couple\nothers.\nCart\nThe Cart can only be hit from the Driving Range ramp.  It starts the game\nworth 100K and goes up 100K via the captive ball Increase Cart Value award.\nVarious numbers of hits will start different modes (see their description\nunder Wheel Awards).\n\n  3 hits - Cart Attack\n  8 hits - Pop-a-Gofer\n 13 hits - Speed Golf\n\n\nIf you hit the Cart to start Cart Attack and the ball then ricochets into\nHole-In-One, DOUBLE Cart Attack starts instead (same thing, all values\ndoubled).  Current ROMs don't double anything else.\nHole-In-One\nAny time you make Hole-In-One during normal play, you finish the current hole\nwith one stroke and collect the Wheel Award.  The points you get for a Hole-\nIn-One start at 400K and go up 100K with each left ramp shot (no known\nlimit).  You also score the Super Jackpot and Special here (when lit).\nGofers\nYour hosts, Bud and Buzz; they'll come up and taunt you throughout the game.\nWhen they do, feel free to give them a good whack!  Each gofer hit scores\n100K (increased by captive ball awards).  During normal play, you'll also\nreduce the current hole's score by 1 stroke (see Wheel Awards for more\ndetails on playing golf).\nBonus\nEvery hole you complete adds to your bonus based on how many strokes it took\nyou.  Each hole has a par value which you'll usually score, but other things\ncan add and subtract strokes.  Each Gofer hit subtracts one stroke, each\nsandtrap and outlane adds one stroke (not sure if a lit kickback adds a\nstroke or not).  There are Wheel awards that can affect stroke counts as\nwell.  Obviously, if you get a Hole-In-One, you finish in 1 stroke.  You can\nnever finish with fewer than 2 strokes unless you get a Hole-In-One.  You can\nalso never finish with more than 7 strokes.\n\nSo, for each hole you finish, you'll get for bonus:\n\n  1 stroke - 250,000\n 2 strokes - 125,000\n 3 strokes - 100,000\n 4 strokes - 75,000\n 5 strokes - 50,000\n 6 strokes - 25,000\n 7 strokes - 10,000\n\n\nIf you haven't finished any holes yet (\"This must be embarrassing for you!\"),\nyou'll get 10,000.  Your total is then multiplied by your bonus multiplier,\namazingly enough (see Cart Paths).\nMultiball\nMultiball is a high-scoring affair in NGG (well, it can be anyway).  To start\nmultiball:\n\n  Shoot the center ramp to raise Bud.\n  Hit Bud.  If you take too long, you must shoot the center ramp again.\n  Lock the ball under the center ramp.\n  Shoot the center ramp to raise Buzz.\n  Hit Buzz.  You'll have to raise him again if you take too long.\n  Lock the ball under the right ramp.\n  Shoot the Putting Green or Hole-In-One to start Multiball.\n\n\nOnce Multiball starts (both:  \"Attaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!\"), balls will be kicked\nout of the Putting Green, the bumpers, and the right orbit (if balls are\nactually locked in the last 2 spots, otherwise they're auto-plunged).\n\nThe left ramp scores the Jackpot, which is worth 3.5M+1M (held for the whole\ngame).  If you make it, then Hole-In-One lights for the Super Jackpot (and\nquite a fanfare) which is worth double the last-collected Jackpot.\n\nAfter collecting the Jackpot, any left inlane will lower the Driving Range\nramp for a shot at the Hole-In-One (Bud:  \"This is my favorite part!\").\nMaking the Super Jackpot relights the Jackpot.  You can also relight the\nJackpot at any time by shooting the right ramp (so both the Jackpot and Super\nJackpot can be lit at the same time).  If the Jackpot is lit, the right ramp\nwill be raised (though Buzz will block it every so often to harass you) for\nan easier shot to the left ramp.\n\nThe third Super Jackpot you make (in the game, not just one multiball) will\nnot earn a double jackpot, but rather the Jackpot value again and an extra\nball!\n\nAfter each Multiball, 2 additional ramp shots are required to raise a Gofer\n(the \"Get TNT\" light on the center ramp will be lit).  If a Gofer raised to\nlight a lock times out, you only need to make one shot to re-raise him, not\nall shots.\nPlaying Golf and The Wheel\nThe main object of the game is to complete golf holes.  To do so, you must\nshoot drives until the Putting Green is lit.  Shooting the Putting Green\ncompletes the hole and scores the current Wheel award.\n\nEach hole has a pre-determined par value.  I'm fairly sure that this value\nminus 1 corresponds to the number of drives that you need to make before\nputting out.  If you don't do anything special, making all drives and then\nshooting the Putting Green will finish the hole with the par value.  Any\nGofer hit during normal play subtracts one stroke from par.  Any outlane or\nthe Sand Trap will add one stroke.  See the Bonus section for details on how\nthis affects your bonus score.\n\nThe Putting Green, when unlit, scores a Water Hazard (but this doesn't affect\nyour golf score).  The Water Hazard is worth from 10-99,990 (it probably\nworks like TZ's Odd Change, i.e. random number of digits, then randomize each\ndigit except the ones).\n\nMaking Hole-In-One any time during normal play finishes the current hole with\none stroke.  On normal settings, completing the 4th hole will give you both\nthe Wheel Award and light the extra ball.\n\nThe currently-selected Wheel award can be changed by the Jet Bumpers, the\nspinners (both incrementally), and the captive ball (spins and stops\nrandomly).\n\nHere is a list of Wheel Awards starting with Hole-In-One and going clockwise\naround the Wheel:\nHole In One\nFinishes the current hole as a Hole-In-One (including the points) instead of\nhow many strokes it would've been.\nBad Shot\nIf you get this \"award\" from as a result of shooting the Putting Green, then\nyou finish the hole with 1 more stroke than you had.  If you get it as a\nresult of getting a Hole-In-One or picking it from Player's Choice, then it\ndoesn't affect the current hole, but rather starts the next hole already at 7\nstrokes.\nRipoff\nThe ball is kicked out to the right flipper from the Putting Green.  You have\n20 seconds or so to hit the captive ball to start Ripoff Multiball.  Ripoff\nMultiball starts off as a 2-ball multiball.  Complete the captive ball lights\n(5 hits) to add another ball into play (up to 5).  There is a ballsaver at\nthe start of multiball and briefly after completing the captive ball.\n\nDuring Ripoff, each ramp scores 100K+25K/captive ball hit.  If you make all 3\nramps, then the ripoff value is doubled.\nSpeed Golf\nThis is a 3-ball multiball, with a brief ballsaver at the beginning.  Every\ninlane triggers the Driving Range ramp for a shot at the Driving Range.  Its\nvalue starts at 250K or so and every switch adds about 1K to the value.  The\nvalue doesn't go down when collected, just keeps getting bigger.\nFree Lock\nSpots one lock towards the next multiball.\nPlayer's Choice\nThe Wheel starts spinning (way too fast for you to stop it where you want),\nand you push both flippers to stop it and get your reward.  Yes, it's\npossible to get Player's Choice again.  :)\nOutlanes\nThe outlanes are lit (Buzz:  \"You drain, you gain.\"), the left for extra\nball, the right for special.  Only one is lit at a time, alternated by the\nslingshots.  Since you have a kickback now, it's possible to get the extra\nball and not lose your current ball in play.\nPop-a-Gofer\nA 20-second timed mode.  Each Gofer hit is worth 1M.  Bud and Buzz will\nusually alternate being up, taunting you the entire time of course.\nWarp\nAdvance a random number (1-3) of holes, but not past hole 9.  You CAN warp to\nhole 9, though, and immediately get Hole-In-One Challenge.  Passing 4 will\nlight the extra ball still, and passing 7 will still play Short Circuit.\nQ Jackpot\nThe left ramp is lit for a jackpot until you collect it or the ball ends.\nIt's worth 1M/hole completed.  An easy way to collect it is to lock a ball\nthen plunge the new ball up the ramp.\nGofer Attack\nThe captive ball is lit for a hurry-up.  It starts at 1M and counts down (not\nsure how far).  Hit the captive ball to collect the points.  The ball is\nkicked out from the Putting Green to the right flipper.\nCart Attack\nEach drive scores 250K+100K (that's all 5 drive arrow shots and the Driving\nRange center ramp shot).  You get a great animation of a Gofer being chased\nby a MX Missile.  (If you look at the Cart plastic, you'll see some missile\nlaunching equipment on it.)  If you hit the Cart (Buzz:  \"You hit your own\ncart!\" then either \"Do it again!\" or \"You're dumber than Bud!\"), you'll\ncollect the total of all shots you've made since the start of Cart Attack or\nthe last Cart Jackpot.\nLight Extra\nBall, that is.  This MUST be collected before you drain (on default\nsettings).\nGofer's Choice\nA Gofer (Bud most of the time I think) will pick an award for you, out of:\n\n Super Jets\n Big Points (1M)\n Dance Party\n Some others...\n\n\nDance Party is simply a frenzy.  Don't remember the scoring exactly at the\nmoment...\nBig Spinners\nBoth spinners are lit for 7,500/spin for the rest of the ball.\nKickback\nAdds one kickback light.\nShort Circuit (non-Wheel)\nAfter the 7th hole, instead of a normal Wheel award, you get Short Circuit.\nA value starts at 2M and starts counting up (presumably the award is\ndisqualified at some point, but I haven't let it go yet).  First you hit a\nKICK target (any of the 5) to stop the value, then hit Buzz to collect it.\nHole-In-One Challenge (Wizard Award)\nAfter the 9th hole, you start the Hole-In-One Challenge.  You get:\n\n  Instantly awarded 1M/Hole-In-One you've made to this point\n  Super Jets\n  Big Spinners\n  Ripoff Multiball\n  Million Plus (1M+1M) on the left ramp (don't know of a limit)\n  Hole-In-One lit for Special\n\n\nHole-In-One Challenge starts out as a 4-ball multiball (and a brief\nballsaver). Since Ripoff is running, it is possible to extend Hole-In-One\nChallenge by completing the captive ball repeatedly (same 5-ball limit as\nRipoff itself).  The left inlanes will lower the Driving Range ramp until you\nmake a Hole-In-One.  After that, I presume only the left ramp will lower the\nDriving Range ramp.\nStrategies\nI won't give you too much yet, since I'm still learning the game myself.\nGetting Multiball at least once or twice is important, because it can be\nworth so much.  It will be difficult getting it much more than that because\nof all the center ramps you'll need to hit.\n\nPlay the modes.  Some modes (like Cart Attack) hold their value throughout\nthe game, and can be worth major points later on.  Don't forget about\nshooting for the Cart Paths for bonus multipliers later in the game since\nyour bonus will just keep getting bigger and bigger.  Definitely try to get\nthe extra ball from the Cart Paths as well.\n\nDuring Ripoff Multiball and Hole-In-One Challenge, definitely wail on the\ncaptive ball.  5 hits may seem like a lot, but it's pretty easy to do.  I\ntypically like to ensure I always have 3 balls on the playfield.  One thing\nto do is when you have 3 balls, hit the captive ball 4 times, waiting until\nyou drain one before finishing it.  This will actually give you 2 balls\nbecause of the ballsaver.\n\n--\nKeith P.

It is held over from ball\nto ball.\n\nIf the Dance Contest is lit, shooting Back-2-Bop will also begin the\nDance Contest.

To light the Comic,\nhit the HA-HA-HA targets.\n\nAn unlit Comic gives a small amount of points and instructs you that\n\"HA-HA-HA lights Comic\".\n\nA lit Comic gives you either: Bonus Booster, Laff Attack, or Surprise.\n\nThe Laff Attack is a frenzy mode during which all targets are worth 100K.\nIt lasts for an adjustable amount of time The only other points that can\nbe collected during Laff Attack are Eat, Drink, B.Merry, and the Ozone Bonus.\n\nHitting a lit Comic when Drink is lit scores a Comic Score of between\n100K - 900K, awards Drink, and makes the Comic unlit.\nMultiball (Happy Hour)\nMultiball can be either started by locking three balls, or as Surprise\nfrom the Comic.  Each lock scores 250K.\n\n\n1st Multiball  Shoot 3 balls into the Cosmic Cottage.\n2nd Multiball  Make Request, then shoot 3 balls into Cottage.\n3rd Multiball  Make Request before each ball is shot into Cottage.\n\n\nIf it is necessary to Make a Request, Da Big Bouncer will appear when\nyou shoot the Cottage, advising you to \"get a pass from the Captain\".\n\nMultiball is 2 ball, and the aim is to shoot the ramp for jackpots, and\nsubsequently for the Big Bang (super jackpot).  Shooting the ramp awards the\ncurrent jackpot, which is a value from 1-7 million, based on the current\nRocket Fuel value (seen by lights on playfield).  Shoot either the\nComic or Back-2-Bop to increase your rocket fuel by 1M each shot.\nMultiball begins with an adjustable Fuel level, usually about 5M.\n\nWhen sufficient fuel has been collected, the Big Bang will be lit at\nthe ramp and will award 10M for the first ramp shot, and the Big Bang\nvalue for the second ramp shot.  The Big Bang ranges from between 20M and\n99,999,999.  On collecting the Big Bang award the game goes into a frenzy\nmode with all targets worth 250K; this lasts until a ball drains.\n\nIf the Big Bang is not collected before draining a ball, the remaining\nrocket fuel score can be collected by shooting the ramp.  This score\ncounts down 1M at a time whilst the game screams \"Head For The Rocket\" at you.\n(See Tricks section for a way to stop the timer).  After draining one of the\nballs, 2X Playfield is lit for the duration of the remaining ball.\nTournament Mode\nDuring Tournament Mode, the Comic no longer awards randomly, but instead\nin the following order: 100K, Laff Attack, Advance Bonus X, Surprise\n(Multiball), 200K, Laff Attack, Advance Bonus X, 300K, 400K, Laff Attack,\nAdvance Bonus X, 500K, 600K . .\n\nOther features are that the Extra Ball is always lit at nine ramps, the\nRocket Fuel starts at 1M, and the Big Bang has a constant value of 20M.\nStrategy\nGo for the Comic if it's lit, as many points can be made during Multiball,\nand also afterwards, utilising the 2X playfield values mode.  Multiball\nseems on average to be awarded once every three Comics.\n\nDuring Multiball, either shoot for the ramp or the Comic, as any ball shot\nto the Comic will stay there for a few handy seconds, and increase your\nRocket Fuel level whilst giving you the chance to shoot for jackpots with\nthe right flipper.\n\nThe W-O-O-C payoff lane can be very lucrative, especially during 2X\nplayfield values.  If you can get 10X playfield values . . see below.\n\nIf Drink and the Comic are both lit, I generally try to let Drink time\nout to collect the Comic award (unless I have 2X playfield values and\nreplay is imminent).  If you have at least 6X bonus, the Comic will no\nlonger award bonus X, giving you more chance for Surprise.\nTricks\nThere is a major bug in Party Zone, and it's best executed on machines with\ntolerable tilt.  During any timed mode (Laff Attack, 10X playfield values,\nJackpot countdown), nudge the game enough to produce a tilt \"warning\".  The\ntimer will stop until you make a \"major\" shot (ie. ramp, Comic, DJ Eject,\nCottage), but not if you're simply hitting the W-O-O-C payoff lane, or\nsmaller targets such as bumpers, standups, etc.  This can lead to huge\nscores during the 10X playfield values mode, as well as a decent jackpot\neven if you drain a ball during Multiball.\n\nAnother trick is if you hit the ball halfway up the Cottage, but it rolls\nout again, hit the Comic quickly, and you will score the Cottage lock.\nThis is useful only if you were specifically aiming for the Cottage, and\nmiss.\nOperator adjustable features\nThe following feature adjustments can be implemented:\n\n\n01Special % (1 - 25)Factory: 2\n02Multiball % (10 - 90)Factory: 35\n03Extra Ball % (5 - 50)Factory: 10\n04Fuel Start Level (1 - 8) [jackpot]Factory: 5\n05W-O-O-C difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) [controls timer]Factory: Medium\n06W-O-O-C timer (5 - 30)Factory: 15\n07Comic difficulty (ExEasy/Easy/Medium/Hard) [when timed?]Factory: Medium\n08Comic timer (5 - 30)Factory: 10\n09Laff Attack timer (10 - 40)Factory: 15\n10Drink timer (5 - 30)Factory: 12\n11B.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Phantom of the Opera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Phantom of the Opera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDave's Guide to\nThe Phantom of the Opera\nVersion Date:  June 12, 1995\nAuthor: Dave Hollinsworth\n\n\nOverview\nThe Phantom of the Opera is a 1987 Data East game, based on the 1911\nGaston Leroux novel of the same name (and NOT based on the famous Andrew Lloyd\nWebber musical, although it was coincidentally released at about the same\ntime....)  Although the most common complaint about the game is that there\nisn't much to do on the playfield, I think that this makes it a good game for\nbeginners and intermediates to practice hitting shots consistently on.\nBasic Playfield Features\n\nFlippers  just the usual lower two.  There is a LOT of space between\nthem, and no center post.  Fun.\nLeft Outlane  has a kickback and an \"Extra Ball\" light.  It's the\ntypical \"Data East Scoop\" design...watch out for it.\nLeft Inlane  lights the spinner for a \"Mystery Score\".\nGrasshoppers  a 3-bank of contact targets.  See \"Grasshoppers and\nScorpions\" below for more information.\nRamp  called the \"Catwalk\", it is a red plastic ramp that feeds\naround the back of the game and to the right inlane.  Each shot adds a letter\nto \"PHANTOM\" and scores 20K + 5K, and completing the word lights the ramp for\nunlimited 1 million point shots.  A bonus of some sort (it never displays\nexactly what) is available by making the ramp after the right inlane, and a\nSpecial is also available here.  On the last ball of the game, shoot this ramp\ntwice in a row to double your score.  Whenever the ramp is lit for something\nimportant, the game will say \"Shoot the Catwalk\", although I\u0105ve always thought\nthat it sounded more like \"Shoot the Jetwalk.\"\nTop Lanes  these are the standard three rollover lanes.  Each has a\nlight with a musical note on it.  Completing them starts a 20-second \"Jackpot\nBuild\" round where every switch adds 1K to the jackpot;  completing them again\nduring this time will reset the clock for a \"Jackpot Build x2\" round, and so\non.  Completing them also lights the spinner for 5K per spin the next time it\nis hit.  At the start of each physical ball (i.e.  Ball 1, but not any extra\nballs earned on Ball 1), one of the lanes will be flashing.  Plunge the ball\nand get it to drop in this lane (non-steerable) for the Skill Shot, which\nawards 100K x ball in play and opens the Organ.\nBumpers  three in the standard triangle below the rollovers.  1K per\npop, and nothing more remarkable.\nMagic Mirror  a sinkhole located dead center, below the lowermost pop\nbumper and hittable from either of the lower flippers.  Shooting it will\nadvance the bonus multiplier by one up to 5x.  The fifth shot of each ball\n(i.e. the one that would have advanced to 6x bonus, if such a thing existed\nhere) will light the Extra Ball at the outlanes, and the sixth shot will Hold\nBonus.  After the sixth shot, the mirror does nothing except award token\npoints.  Balls shot here are ejected out the Trap Door.\nOrgan  this is the main focus of the game.  It is a wide incline (not\nreally a ramp) with three contact targets at the top.  Hitting all three, or\nmaking a skill shot, will open the organ, raising the incline to reveal a wide\nsinkhole.  Shoot this for multiball;  see \"Multiball\" below.  Balls shot here\ngo to a VUK on the left side of the playfield, and are ejected from here into\nthe left inlane.\nSpinner  this is the entrance to a half-orbit that ends up at the\nrollover lanes.  The spinner is worth 1K per spin, or 5K if the rollover lanes\nare completed.  After the left inlane is hit, the spinner scores a \"Mystery\nScore\" (although like the ramp, the game never displays exactly what you get).\nTrap Door  a small, hard-to-hit sinkhole below the spinner.  There\nare three lights here:  Extra Ball, Light Laser Kick, and Instant Lock;  I've\nnever seen the last one lit and don't know how you get it.  Shooting here will\nLight the Laser Kick if it has been used, and will award one of several random\nawards, given below.  All of the awards are pretty decent, so if you can get\nthis shot down it can be quite rewarding.  The awards are:\n\n Points (75K, 100K, 200K)\n Special\n Extra Ball\n Open the Organ - same as hitting the three targets, this will light\nthe 2-ball lock\n 5x Multiplier - if you get this, try to hit the Mirror as soon as\npossible, as it will light the Extra Ball\n Double Jackpot - doubles the current value of the jackpot, maxing at\n2M.\n 5000 Box Lit - lights the spinner for 5K per spin\n Phantom Shot Lit - immediately lights the ramp for million shots\n [did I miss any?]\n\nNote that if the Extra Ball light given above is lit, the game cheats a\nlittle; the ball is awarded by having the Trap Door award an Extra Ball, not\nby awarding it and then a normal Trap Door award.\nScorpions  a 3-bank of contact targets.  See \"Grasshoppers and\nScorpions\" below for more information.\nRight Inlane  has a \"Catwalk Mystery Score\" light.  Rolling over this\ninlane lights the ramp for a mystery award.\nRight Outlane  has an \"Extra Ball\" light.\n\nGrasshoppers and Scorpions\nThe two 3-banks of contact targets each have four awards associated with\nthem:  100K, Hold Bonus & 50K, Light Extra Ball, & Light Special.  At the\nbeginning of each ball, the game will pick one of the awards;  the only way to\nchange it is to collect it or drain the ball.  Completing both banks will\naward the selected value, and select another one.  All except the 100K award\nwill only be available once per ball.  The Light Extra Ball award lights at\nthe Trap Door, not the outlanes.\n\nNote that the game seems to think that these awards are very\nimportant...the available award is displayed in no fewer than THREE places on\nthe playfield:  in front of each bank, and just above the flippers.\nMultiball\nMultiball in Phantom of the Opera has three \"stages\" to it.  First, you\nmust open the Organ, either by making the skill shot or by completing the\nthree contact targets at its top.  Once the Organ is open, shoot it (it's big,\ntrust me, you can't miss) to lock the ball.  The game will display \"Ready for\n2 Ball Play\", and a second ball will be served to the plunger.  Hitting any\nswitch except the top rollovers (no skill shot for this ball) will immediately\nopen the organ and eject the locked ball into play.\n\nDuring 2 ball play, all you gotta do is lock both balls within 10\nseconds of each other.  Lock the first one, and the game will show you how\nmuch time remains until that ball is put back into play.  Warning:  in order\nto count, the second ball must actually be in the lock area before the time\nexpires, not just heading there.  If you're just a little bit to slow, not\nonly will the game kick out the first locked ball, but then the second ball\nwill arrive, the game will think its kickout failed, and it'll kick that one\nout too!\n\nOnce both balls are locked, \"Ready for 3 Ball Play\" is displayed, and\nthe Organ will close.  A third ball is served, same as above.  This time,\nhowever, the Organ does not open for free.  While more than one ball remains\nin play, a single hit of one of the Organ targets will open it for 5 seconds.\nDuring this time, put a ball inside it for the Jackpot.  Once a Jackpot has\nbeen collected, the Organ closes, and you get to bat the remaining balls\naround aimlessly until you lose all but one.  It's also worth noting that\nthere is a small grace period on the Jackpot:  if you lose all but one ball\nwhile the Organ is open, the game will display \"Back to 1 Ball Play\", and then\nstart to close the Organ.  Shooting a ball into the Organ under the closing\ndoor will still award the Jackpot...great for impressing the onlookers.\nOther Stuff\nWell...there's pretty much nothing else to do on this game.  I told you\nit was a simple game.  :-)\nTips, Tricks, Strategies, and such\nThe two biggest sources of points on this game are Multiball and the\nramp millions.  Multiball is by far the easiest to get, so concentrate on it\nfirst.  Just make the skill shot and you've got one free Multiball each ball.\n\nDuring Multiball, after you've gotten the Jackpot, I usually try to herd\nthe balls toward the Magic Mirror.  On the machine I play, the Trap Door\nkickout is amazingly flaky (I've seen it spit balls into ALL THREE possible\ndrain sites), and so the two or three balls in play give you a little\ninsurance against automatic drains.  Once I've collected everything the Mirror\nhas to offer, I'll either start on the ramp letters (yes, you can get the\nMillion shot during Multiball), or flail balls toward the Grasshoppers or\nScorpions.\n\nYou CAN start the \"Double your Score\" during Multiball...avoid that ramp\nat all costs unless you've got another ball waiting on the flippers for a\nclear shot.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Phantom of the Opera", "possible_shots": "Flippers, Left Outlane, Left Inlane, Grasshoppers, Ramp, Top Lanes, Bumpers, Magic Mirror, Organ, Spinner, Trap Door, Scorpions, Right Inlane, Right Outlane", "manufacturer": "Data East", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/phantomoftheopera.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Phantom of the Opera", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

They are arranged\nas usual.\n Left flipper inlane = no effect to the game\n Left outlane = with saver to kick ball back when lit\n Scoop = \"Genie bottle\" which kicks the ball to the right flipper\n Green stand-up = awards extra ball when lit\n Op top of this the magic trunk where balls are locked\n Three bank stand-ups = \"Morph Chamber\".\n Ramp = \"Secret passageway\". Ball is send to the right habitrail returning\nfor the right flipper or ball is send to the magic wand.\n Left loop entry = \"Linking Rings\" is numbered loop 1.\n Mini ramp = \"Showtime Stage\". Ball may be diverted to the right habitrail\nor to the stage.\n Stage = Curtains open and ball is either levitated onto the right\nhabitrail or kicked out to the thumper bumper.\n Thumper bumper = \"Star Pit\". They only exit is on the lower left side.\nUnderneath is a slingshot. Ball can bump for long periods here.\n M-A-G-I-C five bank drop targets.\n Right loop entry = numbered loop 2\n Gobble hole = \"Magic hat\". Ball can enter this hole either by a skill shot\nvia the 'corkscrew' or by a straight shot from the left flipper and will\nreturn from the left scoop.\n Yellow stand-up target = \"Crystal Ball\"\n Right outlane.\n Right flipper inlane = no effect to the game.\n Right flipper.\n\nTHE RULES.\n(These are taken from the preliminary release plus three hours of playing\nand therefore may be changed when the games goes into production.)\n\nNo real modes here although hitting the captive ball will light some extra\nscoring features.\n\nMost important are the three rounds which leads you to a scoring feature\nmust like the 'grand finale' in ToM.\nROUND ONE.\n\nMAGICIANLOCATIONCOMMENTS (if any)\nNostradamus  Left loop 1    (one time)\nShaman       Captive Ball   (one time)\nGreat Hansen Stage ramp     (one time)\nMr. Mystique Left ramp      (one time)\nKenzo        Left loop 1    (two times)\nJadugar      Left ramp      (one time)\nMatra Magna  Left ramp      (twice, one each)\n\n\nBehind the drop targets is a plate with two  holes on top of it. The\nmagic wand will point  over them. Shoot the left ramp to feed the  ball\nunder the magic wand and push a flipper  button to let the ball fall in\nthe lit hole.   Continue to load the ball under the wand until  both\nlights are off, then round two starts.\nROUND TWO.\n\nMAGICIANLOCATIONCOMMENTS (if any)\nNostradamus  Morph Chamber     (three bank on left)\nShaman       Magic Hat         (hole shot)\nGreat Hansen Captive Ball      (one time)\nMr. Mystique Right loop 2      (one time)\nKenzo        Under Magic Hat   (hole shot)\nJadugar      Genie Bottle      (hole shot)\nMatra Magna  Locked Trunk      (three balls)\n\n\nTwo balls must be locked in the trunk. The  third ball will enter the\nplayfield and as  long as at least two balls are in play all  scores are\ntripled. If your ball is lost with  only one ball locked you must start\nagain in  the next ball, thus locking two balls in the  trunk.\nROUND THREE.\n\nMAGICIANLOCATIONCOMMENTS (if any)\nNostradamus   Magic Hat           (one time)              \nShaman        MAGIC targets       (five, one each)        \nGreat Hansen  Morph/Passageway    (three bank, left ramp) \nMr. Mystique  Showtime Stage      (right ramp)            \nKenzo         Morph/MAGIC targets (three and five bank)   \nJadugar       Crystal Ball        (colour match)          \nMagna Matra   Entire playfield    (all shots valid)       \n\n\nThis may be compared with Tom's Grand Finale.  The display shows the face\nof Queen Magna Matra being quite unfriendly. Hit all main shots and she\nwill scream and turn older. The number of needed shots is unknown\n(probably ten). On the last three shots a gun is pointed to Matra and the\nfinal shot will turn her into a skeleton scoring 500M.\n\nWhen you've finished round three it starts all over again.\n\nOther shots. Most, but not all, may coincide with a trick shot needed to\nimpress the lit magician.\nSKILL SHOT.\nShoot the ball and let it drop into the hat.  Scores 5M or start Mayhem\nwhen lit.\nGENIE BOTTLE.\nTimer counts down to zero. Display offers player choices. Hit either\nflipper to choose. A bad decision ends the session. For each good choice\nadditional points.\nSHOWTIME STAGE.\nShot up the Showtime ramp onto the Stage and in the Star Pit. Hits will\nincrease the Box office points. When the ball is diverted to the right\nhabitrail repeat the shot until all of the Box Office Marquee is lit. When\ndone the box office point value is added to the score.  When box office\nflashes back and forth and show time is lit shoot the ball onto the stage\nand then hit as many targets as possible with the timer running down. Each\nnext switch will score more.\nTHE SECRET PASSAGEWAY.\nShooting the ball up the left ramp divert the ball either to the right\nhabitrail or to the magic wand. The wand is mostly pointing to the left\nfeeding balls to the magic trunk. When Silence the Critics is active\n(Matra Magna's first challenge) it point to the right and every now and\nthen it is weaving (you must have done something wrong I guess).\nTHE CRYSTAL BALL.\nA bit complicated. This is from the book since we couldn't figure it out\nwhile playing.  First hit the target at any time. The colour should be\ndisplayed (probably somewhere amongst the magicians and not on the\ndisplay). Try to hit the target again when the same colour is lit for many\nmore points. When the target is hit again with a colour match Presto\nChangeo is lit.  Colours extinguish when hit. Turn off all colours to\ncomplete trick and collect full point value.\nAMATEUR HOUR.\nHit the captive ball until 'Light Showtime' is made. Shoot the ball onto\nthe Stage, then in the Star Pit. As long as the timer is running a nice\nscore is given for each hit in the Pit.\nMAGIC MAYHEM. (Another name for Multiball).\nHit all three Morph targets and lock 1 will be lit above the left ramp.\nYou can lock one or two balls. When one ball is locked the magic hat will\nstart mini mayhem, with two balls locked it is magic mayhem. According to\nthe book jackpots can only be made with magic mayhem but it will happen\nwith either at the same point value.\nJACKPOT.\nThe Jackpot will be awarded by making the left ramp during multiball. It\nstart with a fixed value (20M). Once made shoot the right loop.  This will\nstart 'Build Jackpot timer'. When ti mer runs out another timer will lit\nJackpot.  Shoot the left ramp within the time to collect the total build\njackpot. This sequence repeats itself until multiball ends.\nEXTRA BALL.\nHit the captive ball until 'Lite Extra Ball' is made. A timer start.\nCollect the extra ball at the small green target just above the Genie\nBottle before the timer runs out.  To our belief the captive ball lights\nreset when completed. Otherwise there can be only one extra ball per\nplayer per game.\nSPINNER.\nIs always scoring but will give many more points when 'Lite Spinner' is\nmade with the captive ball.\nREAPPEARING BALL.\nNeither of the players liked that name but is just another name for a ball\nsaver.\nMIRACULOUS SAVE.\nIs the kicker in the left outlane. Can be re-lit by completing the Morph\nthree bank.\nMISCELLANEOUS.\nA ball via the right outlane is always lost.  It is funny the read the\nmanual.  With all shots there is a comment in the column 'Player action'.\nFor the right outlane it says \"Avoid this Out Lane as long as possible\".\nThat makes sense to me.\n\nThe flipper inlanes light a loop each for more points.\n\nTalking points. All scores are a bit down to Earth again. The test game\nwas set for ten-ball play to let the players have more change to see what\nthere is. The best score with five buy-ins was a low 2B.\n\nThere is no special!\n\nCompleting the rounds with a three ball game may be considered impossible.\nYou can however make a lot of shots and have a good game. But it means it\nmay cost too much for players to try to get to the end to see what\nhappens.\n\nLights don't flash, they fade on and off. Here is the only real negative\npoint to me on this game. When the volume is turned down and some lamps\nare broken you have to know the shots by heart to continue through the\nrounds. More visible lights may help to ease this.\n\nToM had a theme as if you visited the Theatre for a night out. PM is more\na school were you are a pupil. Well, not exactly. Matra Magna was banned\nfrom the real world many years ago for an unknown reason and she formed\nthe Society of Masters. She never has completely disappeared from her old\nhaunts. She and her crew broke through the barriers of time and space to\ncause trouble with the mortals. She did it by taking over a pinball\nmachine. Well, this way I don't really mind her doing so.\n\nThe sounds are less friendly. Two I remember best since I liked them best.\nOne is losing the ball with the saver on: \"Lost something?\", the other\nmaking jackpots: A rather panicky voice \"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,\nJACKPOT\"\n\nThe test game had a steep slope for the play field and was very fast. When\nthe slope is reduced and the games seems too fast there is an option of\nlowering the flipper power simply by adjusting it in the menu.\n\nThe overall thought is this game can stand next to ToM and will do fine.\nMany shots can be found in other games. Nowadays the differences are\nmarginal. Capcom did a fine job. Those asking themselves which was there\nfirst, ToM or PM, I don't know. I do know that Capcom worked on this game\nfor two years and three more games are already developed.\n\nAnd now: \"Let the game begin\". Enjoy it.\n\nAnybody which can use a bit or all of this rules is free to do so. That's\nwhat the Net is for to me.

The second ball will be locked, and a third ball\nwill be fed to the plunger lane.\nMEGAMODE (3 ball):\nWhen in 2 ball Megamode, shoot Joker to lock one ball, then shoot\nthe gun to lock the second ball.  A third ball will be placed in\nthe plunger lane.\nScoring is double in 3 ball Megamode!\nGeneric MEGAMODE Rules: (Applies to all MEGAMODEs)\nShoot for flashing card.  One card on each deck will be flashing.\nEach deck starts out with the 10 flashing, and proceeds to\nlight Jack, Queen, King, and finally Ace.  You can collect\nthe card by hitting the standup target, or by shooting the\n\"Collect <suite> Card\" shots that are lit.  The upper loop will\nspot a Spade.  When you collect the ace of any suite, it will award\nyou the Jackpot!  Jackpot scores are:  10 Mil plus 5 Mil for each\n\"Collect Card\" shot hit for that suite.\nAfter you collect ALL of the cards, shoot Joker for Super Jackpot\nof 100 Mil!\n\nMODES\nMost (all?) modes are timed, but there is no timer.  You know when\na mode is going to end, by hearing the ticking sound.  When you\nhear the horse sound, the mode is over.  All points scored for mode\nfeatures are added to the players score at the end of the round.\n\nRICOCHET:\nShoot pop bumpers for 1 Mil.  Total score for this mode is\n5 Mil plus 1 Mil. for each pop bumper hit.\nACE OF SPADES:\nShoot Ace of Spades.  This is a count-up mode!  Starts out at\n5 Mil, then goes up to 10, 25, 50, and finally 100 Mil.!\nBLACKJACK: (also called BLACKJACK RAMP)\nShoot an ace and a Jack,\nthen shoot the Blackjack ramp and score 21 Mil.  Repeat until\ntime runs out.  Shooting the Joker will give you blackjack, so you\njust need to shoot the blackjack ramp.  Scoring is (???) 5 Mil plus\nfirst card is 10 Mil, 2nd card 15 Mil, etc..., plus 21 Mil for\nBlackjack Ramp (when lit).  ie:  Shoot an ace and a jack to light\nblackjack ramp, then shoot blackjack ramp and then time runs out\nand mode ends will score 5 + 10 + 15 + 21 = 51 Mil.\nSHOOT OUT:\n\"Partner, do I hafta shoot yer?\"  (Notice the awesome stereo\nsound and speech effects, and the different digital\ndisplays during this mode!!!)\nAll switches score 500,000.  Mode score is 5 Mil (?)\nplus 500,000 for each switch hit.\nSUPER SHOT:\nShoot the backglass gun, and it will light up a whole\ncolumn of cards.  You score 20 Mil for completing a\ncolumn of cards, plus awards for any completed rows!\nACES WILD:\nShoot any ace for 5 Million.  Total round score is 5 Million plus 5\nMillion times number of aces shot.\nJOKER POKER:\nShoot anything for 500,000 points.  Total round score is 5 Million\nplus 500,000 time number of switches hit during the round.  I think\nthe Joker increases the 500,000 point value.\nROYAL LOOPS:\nShoot for flashing card to spot a card.  Shoot for Upper Loop or\nClub Loop to spot two cards.  Joker spots two cards.  Scoring is\n25 Mil per royal flush (?) plus 5 Mil.\n\nFIRING THE BACKBOX GUN\nUse either flipper to select a suit from the backbox deck.  After an\namount of time, the game will begin the READY - AIM - FIRE sequence.\nThen the backbox gun is lit, and you need to shoot the coin over the\ncolumn of the card that you want.  Shoot the gun at the lit coin by\npressing either of the flipper buttons.\nThis will spot the card under the coin that you shot in the suit you\nselected.\nYou score 20 Million for completing a row.  Awards for completing a row\nare as follows plus 20 Million:  (Medium is the default)\nBackbox Row Awards\n\nRows Completed\n\nDifficulty\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nExtra Easy\nLight Extra Ball\nMegamode\nLight Special\nMegamode\nIncrease Bonus X\nLight Extra Ball\nMegamode\n20 Mil\n\nEasy\nMegamode\nLight Extra Ball\nMegamode\nLight Special\nIncrease Bonus X\nLight Extra Ball\nMegamode\n20 Mil\n\nMedium\nMegamode\nIncrease Bonus X\nLight Extra Ball\nLight Special\nMegamode\nIncrease Bonus X\nLight Extra Ball\n20 Mil\n\nHard\nIncrease Bonus X\nMegamode\nLight Extra Ball\nIncrease Bonus X\nLight Special\nMegamode\nLight Extra Ball\n20 Mil\n\nExtra Hard\nIncrease Bonus X\nIncrease Bonus X\nMegamode\nIncrease Bonus X\nLight Extra Ball\nIncrease Bonus X\nLight Special\n20 Mil\n\n\nTIP:  Instead of looking for the lit coin, fire the gun based on the\nclicks.\nPISTOL MANIA\nAfter collecting all chips, shoot the Joker for PISTOL MANIA!  Lights\nextra ball (Upper Loop) and special (Ace of Spades).\n\"An' nobody can say anythin'!\"\nOne ball is placed in the plunger lane, and after it is shot out,\nanother ball is placed in the plunger lane.  You score 1 Mil for each\nswitch hit!  (Ie: Blackjack ramp scores 2 Mil because there is 2\nswitches on the ramp!)  Mode lasts until there is only one ball\nleft.\nI believe that some modes (like Ricochet) are started when you start\nPISTOL MANIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Pistol Poker", "manufacturer": "Alvin G. & Co.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/pistolpoker.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Pistol Poker", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Copying,\nreproducing, etc. is fine.\n\nSpecial thanks to no one yet, since this is the first version.\n\nJim Seward\nLayout\nStarting from the plunger and working counter-clockwise...\n\n\nPLUNGER  Of the manual variety.\n\nHANDCUFF KICKOUT  Awards an incremental Handcuff Score when lit, or\n10K*ball number if skill shot ends up here.\n\nSPINNING TARGET  This is used for the Skill Shot.  Values of skill shot\nchange depending on number of times target is spun.\n\nDIAMOND WEASEL DROP TARGETS  Put Weasel in jail when all targets are\ndropped.  One of four crooks to be caught to lite jackpot.\n\nSKILL SHOT KICKOUT  Hidden underneath Skill Shot value display.  Holds\nball until Skill Shot value is determined.\n\nRIGHT RAMP  Has many functions, including locking balls, spotting P-O-L-I-C-E\nletters, awarding Jackpots, and doubling scores.  A diverter at the top of the\nramp sends the ball either to the locking area or to the left\ninlane.\n\nG-U-N  When all three of these lanes are lit, bonus multiplier advances\nby one.  Lit lane changes to the left with the left flipper, and to the\nright with the right flipper.\n\nPOP BUMPERS  Standard variety in the standard triangle.  Directly below\nG-U-N lanes.\n\nEXTRA BALL/TOP COP TARGET  Up and left of the G-U-N lanes.  Scores the\nExtra Ball when lit or the TOP COP bonus when lit (explained\nlater).\n\nCROC KICKOUT  Puts Croc in jail if he's not already there.  Also scores\na random \"Hot Sheet\" value displayed just below the scores on the\nbackglass.\n\nPOLICE CAR GIZMO  Balls are locked underneath the car.  When\nMulti-Ball(tm) begins, the car moves down and sends the balls to the left\ninlane.\n\nLOAN SHARK TARGETS  When all three of these are hit, the Shark goes to\njail.\n\nLEFT OUTLANE, LEFT INLANE, RIGHT INLANE, RIGHT OUTLANE  Will score an\nextra ball if it is lit on that particular lane (this EB is only lit on\nthe last ball when the game feels sorry for you.)\n\nLEFT AND RIGHT SLINGSHOTS  Nothing fancy.\n\nMIDDLE RAMP  Scores the value indicated underneath it, from 5K to\nUnlimited Millions.  When UM is reached, EB is lit at the Top Cop\ntarget.\n\nDRUG RAT DROP TARGETS  Put Drug Rat in jail when all three are\ndown.\n\n\nTHERE IS A CENTER POST IN BETWEEN THE FLIPPERS!\nScoring\n\nSKILL SHOT  Scores 10K, 25K, 50K, 75K+Spot P-O-L-I-C-E Letter, and 100K,\ndepending on the number of spins of the spinner.  This is multiplied by\nthe ball number (extra balls inclusive).  If the spinner is broken or the\nball doesn't reach the spinner, the player is awarded 10KxBall\nNo.\n\nHOT SHEET  Scores one of five values when lit at the Croc kickout: Hot\nScore (mystery), Hot Extra Ball, 5 Free Games, Spot P-O-L-I-C-E, and Hot\nMulti-Ball(tm).  Note: Hot Multi-Ball(tm) is only awarded if one ball is\nalready locked.  Obviously, the 5 Free Games comes up the least.\n\nJACKPOT  Contrary to many current games, Jackpot can be collected\nwithout Multi-Ball(tm).  To lite the Jackpot on the right ramp, all four\ncriminals must be put in jail (Croc, Shark, Rat, and Weasel).  Criminals\nin jail are indicated in the upper left part of the playfield above the\nCroc Kickout.  When all four are incarcerated, Jackpot is lit and is\ncollected by one shot up the right ramp.  Value ranges from a minimum of\n1,000,000 to a maximum of 4,000,000 and is increased for a period of time\nafter G-U-N is spelled (See Bonus Multiplier)\n\nMULTI-BALL(tm)  To lock balls for Multi-Ball(tm), shoot the right ramp.\nLocked balls are indicated by the green lights at the bottom of the ramp\n(a solid \"Lock n\" indicates that ball is locked, a blinking \"Lock n\"\nindicates that that ball is next to be locked).  Usually, lock is ready\nat the start of the game.  On subsequent Multi-Balls(tm), a criminal must\nbe put in jail before lock will be lit (Operator-adjustable).  If lock is\nnot lit, then a P-O-L-I-C-E letter will be spotted.  During\nMulti-Ball(tm), which BTW is 2-Ball, all playfield values are doubled.\nThat's all.\n\nP-O-L-I-C-E  Letters are spotted by shooting the right ramp when lock is\nnot lit, with a 75K Skill Shot, or from the Hot Sheet.  Spotting all 6\nletters lites the TOP COP BONUS (Collected at the top of the playfield in a\nhalf-orbit shot) for 3,000,000.  TOP COP stays lit until collected or the end\nof the current ball, whichever comes first.\n\nBONUS MULTIPLIER  Bonus is multiplied by lighting all three G-U-N lanes\n(lit lanes change with flippers).  When the multiplier increases, the\njackpot is increased by all targets for a period of time.  End of ball\nbonus is then multiplied by whatever the multiplier is up to.  On most\ngames, the multiplier is carried over to subsequent balls if it is 2X or\n3X.  If the multiplier is above 3X, then it is reset to 1X on the next\nball.  Special is lit when the multiplier is max-ed out (6X).\n\nMIDDLE RAMP  A virtual gold-mine of scoring opportunity.  This is where\nyou can score most of your points if you can master the shot.  On most\ngames, the value is already up to 50K for the first shot.  Subsequent\nshots score 75K, 100K, 150K, and Unlimited Millions.  When the shot is\nmade, the next shot must be made without hitting any targets to collect\nthe next value, and it must be done within a short time.  (This is\nsomewhat different during Multi-Ball(tm) - hitting targets has no effect)\nWhen Unlimited Millions is reached, Extra Ball is lit at the Top Cop\ntarget when the ramp shot is missed.  Also, the ramp value drops to it's\nminimum value (5K) and will increase to 10K, 25K, and then the values\nlisted above.\n\n\nTHOSE ARE THE MAJOR SCORING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE GAME.\n\nOther minor ones would include the jet bumpers, the slingshots, and all\ntargets.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Police Force", "manufacturer": "Williams Manufacturing, Inc.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/policeforce.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Police Force", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Corrects some typos. Adds archive URL.\n\nVersion 1.0  3/6/96 - First attempt\n\n Description \n\nPop 'n Pinball is the answer to a question that has raged here on\nr.g.p. for some time now. What about the newbie? By firmly targeting\nthis game at the 3-7 year old set, Fisher-Price has taken a bold step\ntowards introducing younger players to pinball.\n\nThe game cabinet is noticeably smaller than standard machines. In\nfact, the machine has no legs. In fact, it's 10 inches long by 8 1/2\ninches wide by 2 inches thick. Consider it laptop pinball.\n\nThe flipper buttons ore oversized, about the size of a golfball cut in\nhalf. Additionally, they are positioned on the top of the machine,\nwhere one would normally find a lockdown bar. I believe the idea for\nDemolition Man's handles may have started here.\n\nA great advance has been made in power supply engineering. This may\nactually be the only machine you can play in a blackout, as it derives\nall its juice from 2 C cell batteries.\n\n Playfield Layout \n\nStarting at the right outlane, and working clockwise: Total playfield\nsize 5 1/2\" long by 6 1/2\" wide.\n\n\nRight Outlane  Well, there is no right outlane. \n\nRight flipper  Far from standard. 2 inches from tip to base It's\ndirectly linked to the flipper button. It will activate when the\nmachine is turned off. \n\n Center drain  No center drain \n\n Left flipper  same as right. \n\n Left Slingshot  1 1/2 inches long. Rubber, no kicker \n\n Twirling Parrot  A spinner with two paddles that is designed to\nimpede shots. The paddles are about 3/4 of an inch across. \n\n Upper Left Slingshot  Same as lower. \n\n Animal Popper Stand ups  Three stand up targets that, when hit, make\nthe plastic target animals pop out of the top of the machine. They\nare, left to right: Red Monkey, Yellow Lion, Blue Hippo \n\n Upper Right Slingshot  Same as left \n\n Twirling Toucan  Same as Parrot, but with a Toucan \n\n Right Slingshot  Same as left \n\n Right Outlane  Again, no outlane. In fact, there is no way for the\nball (which is the size of a Hyperball ball,) to leave the playfield,\nThis is a great attraction to the Newbie. \n\n Monkey Spinner  In the center of the playfield is the Monkey Spinner, a twirling disc,\nsimilar to the Pizza on TMNT. It features two 1/2 inch posts, that again, impede shots to the\nAnimal Popper Stand ups \n\n\n Rules \n\nPress red Start button, located next to left flipper button. This\nactivates the Twirling Parrot, Toucan, and the Monkey Spinner. You now\nhave 90 seconds in which to hit all three Animal Popper Stand-ups. If\nyou do, you will hear an electronic victory theme, and the\ngame ends. If you fail to complete the stand-ups in the allotted time,\nthe game ends.\n\nTo reset game, depress the Animal Poppers, and push Start.\n\n Strategy \n\nDue to the unique flipper structure, holding one flipper up and then\nshooting the ball with the other flipper is a guaranteed way to score\na perfect hit on the Yellow Lion stand up, providing you achieve the\nproper timing on the Monkey Spinner. Of course, the electronic\nnoise generated by holding the flipper may drive you crazy, but that's\npinball.\n\n<NEW>Holding the right flipper up *slightly* and depressing the left\nflipper sharply is the fastest way to hit the Blue Hippo. Conversely,\nholding the left flipper *slightly* and depressing the right flipper\nsharply is the best technique for the Red Monkey. Of course, as with\nthe Yellow Lion, you must time the Monkey Spinner properly.\n\nDespite the COMPLETE lack of a tilt mechanism, it is not considered\ngood form to pick the machine up and then roll the ball into the stand\nups.\n\n Easter Eggs \n\nI'm sure a child would adore finding this in an Easter basket, next to\nall the eggs & candy.\n\n Scoring \n\nIn a dramatic departure from tradition, there is NO scoring. You\neither complete the game, or you do not. This could be a trend.\n\n Conclusion \n\nParenthood will drive you to do some pretty strange things, including\nwriting a rulesheet for a Fisher Price Toy Pinball machine.\n\nScott Piehler (RSP)- Atlanta, GA\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been\nupdated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Pop 'n' Pinball", "possible_shots": "Right flipper, Left flipper, Left Slingshot, Twirling Parrot, Upper Left Slingshot, Animal Popper Stand ups, Upper Right Slingshot, Twirling Toucan, Right Slingshot, Monkey Spinner", "manufacturer": "Fisher-Price", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/popnpinball.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Pop 'n' Pinball", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

(not counting early PAPA IV finalists .. :)\n\nCurrent known software versions are: PA-0  PA-5  LA-2  LA-5  PX-3\nMy opinions are derived from a PX-3 machine.\nGeneral Comments:\nMy initial opinion of this game was not particularly high. It\nimproved a little while the hardware was still working and I had some\nidea what I was doing, but after substantially more play I have decided\nthat this is the worst game I can think of in Bally history!  Arriving\nhot on the heels of ST:TNG didn't help it any either.\n\nThe newer software seems solid, if somewhat useless, but the hardware\nhas some major problems: notably a weak plunger and a very bad lock\nhole. Graphics/animation and the sound are both good quality but really\nonly provide a distraction to the player - they do nothing to let the\nplayer know what is happening, and it is pretty rare you see your score\ndisplayed.\nPlayfield Layout\nContinuing the current trend, this is another widebody and plays\non two levels.  The playfield is a little cluttered with a good number of\nshots hidden from normal view making them hard to hit consistently. We\nalso see a return to the 'Mutant Pygmy' flippers making the centre drain\npretty painful.\n\nThe following is how the playfield is laid out starting on the\nlower level from the cavernous centre drain and working clockwise:\n\n\nSail Again  A small light between the flippers, flashing when the Ball\nSaver is active and hard on when Extra Ball has been awarded.\nNote: the default setting for the Ball Saver is off so don't\nbe surprised if yours does not work.\n\nLeft Flipper  Short, 2.5 inch variety. (yuk!)\n\nLeft Slingshot  Standard triangular type, although apparently aligned\nsuch that flipper passes are next to impossible.\n\nLeft Inlane  Nothing special here either.  Lights right loop when lit.\n\nLeft Outlane  No kickback. Collect Extra Ball when lit.\n\nP-O-P Targets  Bank of 3 stand up targets making up the first half of\nPOPEYE.  Spell POPEYE to light a Spinach Can (more later).\n\nLeft Loop  Called the 'Round House' loop.  Potentially BIG point scorer\nand used to collect animals.  This is one of the shots with a\nSpinach Can.\n\nSEA Target  One half of SEA-HAG which lights Collect Item at the Left Ramp.\n\nLeft Ramp  Increments the 'Ramps' count which has a similar function to\nBear Kicks in TAF.  Collects Jackpot during Multiball, and an Item\nwhen lit.  This shot also has a Spinach Can and feeds to the\nright inlane.\n\nAnimal Sinkhole  Feeds to the Animals on the upper level.  Starts\nInstant Multiball when lit and is another shot with a Spinach Can.\n\nLeft Jab Target  Single stand up target used to light Lockjaw and\nduring Fight Bluto rounds.\n\nLockjaw  Sinkhole used for locking balls for Multiball and relighting\nJackpot once collected. This is also the Multiball kickout.\n(see below: Miscellaneous)\n\nRight Jab Target Same as the Left Jab above.\n\nJet Bumpers  Situated Behind Jab/Lockjaw/Jab (ie Bluto's head) is the\nusual combination of three pop bumpers. Ball can exit these into\nthe Animal & Fight Bluto sinkholes, either side of Bluto's head,\nand up through the O-Y-L rollovers.\n\nO-Y-L Rollovers  Spell OYL to advance BonusX by 1 and light Fight Bluto.\nO-Y-L lights are rotated right by both flippers.\n\nFight Bluto Cartel  Sinkhole which feeds to the right inlane. Starts a\nFight Bluto round when lit. This shot has a Spinach Can too.\n\nHAG Target  The other half of SEA-HAG. Shoot SEA-HAG to light Collect\nItem at the left ramp.\n\nRight Loop  Called 'Round House' loop. Collects Animals and scores good\npoints. Another shot with a Spinach Can.\n\nEscalator  Access to the upper level.  When lit will allow you to select\na random award (more later) before sending the ball up.\n\nE-Y-E Targets  The other half of POPEYE. Shooting POPEYE will light a\nSpinach Can.\n\nRight Outlane  Nothing unique about this.  Collects Special when lit.\n\nRight Inlane  Bog standard lane fed from left ramp, upper playfield and\nthe skill shot. Lights Left Loop when lit.\n\nRight Slingshot  Another basic triangle.\n\nRight Flipper  Short, 2.5 inch variety.\n\n\nAs well as the lower playfield, there is a basic upper playfield\nmade up of two sections which can be accessed in one of two ways: via\nthe Escalator which will access both, or the Animal Sinkhole which just\nfeeds to the Animals.\n\n\nAnimals  This is of a similar size and location to IJ's Path of\nAdventure gadget although it is fixed.  The ball is fed from\neither Kneedeep (the mini upper playfield) or the Animal\nsinkhole. The left flipper fires a kicker which diverts the ball\ninto an Animal which eventually drops into the Left Inlane.\n\nKneedeep Playfield Fed from the Escalator, this is a true mini-playfield\nwith two short (ala Thing) flippers in the appropriate position\nand a centre drain hole which drops the ball down through\nBluto's head to where Lockjaw kicks out.\n\nSuper Animal Targets  Two stand up targets which light Super Animal\nwhen hit are left of the left flipper.\n\nSuper Animal exit  Just above the targets is a gap which feeds left to\nthe Animals section.  It is lit for Super Animal if the targets\nhave been hit.\n\nSwea' Pea  Directly opposite the flippers is a short, steep ramp which\nleads to three gates. Shooting these gates searches for Swea' Pea.\nThis feeds around the back of the Super Animal targets to the\nupper left flipper.\n\n2X Wheel exit  Right of the Swea' Pea gates is an exit to the Skill Shot\nwheel.  Collects Extra Ball when lit and doubles value of the\nwheel when lit for that.\n\nEscalator  Below the 2X Wheel is the exit from the Escalator.  If the\nball finds its way down here it is sent straight back up.\n\nSkill Shot Wheel  A rotating wheel is roughly the same position as IJ's\nIdol and containing 8 awards. The ball arrives from either the\nplunger shot or from the Kneedeep playfield and feeds to the\nRight Inlane.  See below for list of awards.\n\nGameplay:\nThe following section provides some detailed descriptions of\nwhat's worth what and how to get various awards. I suspect that there is\na bit more to this game than first meets the eye, but I doubt it will\never get enough play for us to ever discover everything.  Also, since\nyou cannot see your score half the time, it's been very difficult to\nfind out what shots score what.\n\n\nSkill Shot  With a bit of practice and no hardware problems (more\nlater), this is a fairly easy thing.  The ball is launched up a\nshort habitrail and drops onto a rotating disc which contains\n8 different awards in order as follows:\n\n100,000 points10M points \nLite Lock     Spinach Can\nOYL\t      Spot Animal\n2M points     Spot Item  \n\nThis skill wheel may also be fed from the Kneedeep playfield.\nIf this is the case you have no control over the ball and if 2X\nWheel was lit the above awards are doubled.\n\nRound House Loops  When lit, consecutive loop shots are worth\n2M^(no. of loops) with a maximum (if any) of at least 32M. Note\nthat consecutive shots means just that; if you hit any other\nswitch between two loops, the loop value is reset to 2M although\nthe loop still remains lit for a few seconds. Lighting loops is\ndone as follows:\n\n\n From the inlanes. There is always one and only one inlane lit\nfor Lite Loop and this swaps on each flipper press. If\ncollected, the opposite loop is lit so the left inlane lights\nthe right loop and vice versa.\n\n During Save the Animals where each loop saves an animal as well\nas scoring points. They do not have to be consecutive to save\nAnimals though.\n\n During Fight Bluto loops will often be lit. Again, in addition\nto points, a loop will also help towards defeating Bluto.\n\n\nThe animation of Bluto getting a right hook and his head spinning\naround is quite good, especially if you manage to hit a few\nconsecutive loops.\n\nAnimals  When the ball finds its way up to the Animals area, you have\nto divert it from the left lane into the right lane where the\nAnimals (Rhino, Panda, Leopard, Eagle & Dolphin) are by means\nof a kicker controlled by the left flipper.  If you are\nsuccessful in collecting an Animal you have a limited amount of\ntime in which to shoot loops and save them.  Saving at least one\nshould be fairly easy since the ball is dropped from this upper\narea into the left inlane.    Animals are worth 5M each.\n\nIf you manage to save all five, this starts a Hurry Up counter\nat 50M (maybe 40M) and shows an animation of Bluto being\nchased by the Animals. Shoot the Left Ramp to collect the points.\n\nSuper Animal  This is the top left exit from the Kneedeep playfield and\nis lit by hitting one of the two targets on Kneedeep. It feeds\nto the Animal lane (surprise).  The 'Super' bit just means you\nget double the points you would for an ordinary Animal.\n\n2X Wheel  The top right exit from Kneedeep.  Collects Extra Ball if lit\nand awards double the Skill Wheel value it lands in.  This is by\nfar the best thing to go for up there.\n\nPOP & EYE Targets  Spelling POP or EYE awards 2M, or 3M if it was done\nin sequence.\n\nSpinach Can  Spelling POPEYE lights one of the five Spinach Cans which\ncorrespond to various playfield shots (see playfield layout for\nlocations).  Once a Can is lit, it stays lit for the rest of the\nball or until that shot is hit. Making a shot with a lit Can\nscores double the value of that shot including anything else\nthat may be lit there (ie Jackpot).\n\nIf you light enough Spinach Cans, you hear a sort of 'hurry up'\ntype of sound effect.  Buggered if I know what you are meant to\ndo though - the display didn't help and there were no lights\nflashing violently.\n\nEscalator Award  When lit, a shot to the Escalator allows you to select\nan award before the ball is pumped up to the Kneedeep field.\nThe awards are displayed and can be advanced by pressing the\nflippers. There is a time limit to this (operator settable) and\nonce that time expires, the award currently displayed is given.\nI understand that the awards are also shown in the same sequence\nevery time so if you have enough time you MAY be able to cycle\nthrough them if you have missed a good one - I would recommend\nyou take more care in the first place. The following is a list\nof known awards:\n\nSpot POP\t Spot EYE\nSpot OYL\t Lite Lock\nSpot Item\t Spot Animal\nSpinach\t\t Jets at Max\nSpecial\t\t Extra Ball\nLight Escalator  Points (various values from 20 up to 10M)\n\n\nNote that the Extra Ball only lights the 2X Wheel exit from the\nKneedeep playfield for an EB. You have to score that shot to\ncollect one.\n\n Loops s to the left ramp are recorded in a counter (think\nBear Kicks, Robots) and an award is made every 4 loops so this\ncould be quite useful.  The first few are as follows:\n\n4 loopsLight Spinach\n8 loopsLight Extra Ball at left outlane (!!!!)\n12 loopsLight Spinach\n16 loopsSpot Animal (?)\n20 loopsLight Spinach\n\nIt would appear that every other award is Light Spinach. If this\nis the case, it should not be too difficult to collect loop\nawards since the first Spinach Can to be lit is always at the\nLeft Ramp.\n\nFind Swea' Pea  When on the Kneedeep playfield, shoot the three gates\nto search for Swea' Pea.  The display shows a picture of three\ndoors, with a miniature map to the left.  The 'X' on the map is\nwhere Swea' Pea is hiding, and the doors match up with the gates\non the playfield.  Shooting a gate will move you through the\ncorresponding door unless it is not available (you can tell this\nby lights at the entrance to the gate, or from the map).\n\nIf you actually manage to find Swea' Pea (and it's bloody hard),\nyou might be forgiven for not noticing.  On our game, there is\nnothing special on the display, and only a 'ding ding' sound\neffect to give you any hint that you've found him - you don't even\nget to see how many points it's worth (apparently 50M).\n\nSea Hag Multiball  This is the Instant Multiball which can be which can\nbe lit at the Animal sinkhole. Lighting it is done by collecting\nall four Items (Can Opener, Baby Bottle, Ketchup, Flower) from\nthe left ramp when lit or from the Skill Wheel. Lighting the\nleft ramp is done by hitting the SEA & HAG targets.\n\nOnce this 4 ball Multiball is running, you need to return the\nItems to their owners to collect a mammoth number of points.\n(OK, 50M ..:) I believe you need one POPEYE target to return the\nCan Opener, one OYL target to return the Flower, hit a Find\nSwea' Pea gate to give the bottle back and the 2X Wheel shot for\nWimpy's Ketchup.\n\nBluto Multiball  Lock three balls in Lockjaw to start the Bluto\nMultiball.  Lockjaw is lit either from the Skill Wheel, an\nEscalator award or shooting the two Jab targets.\n\nWhen it starts, Sail Again (the ball saver) is active for some\ntime while the balls are kicked out.  This is neccessary since\nthe balls are kicked SDTM (like JP's Raptor Pit).  The objective\nis to shoot the left ramp to collect the Jackpot, shoot Lockjaw\nto relight it and so on until there are less than 2 balls in\nplay.\n\nSuccessive Jackpots are worth 30M x Jackpot number. A Spinach\nCan lit on the left ramp will double the jackpot, although no\njackpot (doubled or otherwise) will exceed 180M.\n\nIf you drain 2 of the 3 balls without collecting a Jackpot, you\nget about 20 secs to restart Multiball by shooting Lockjaw.\n\nStampede Mode  Just above the flippers in the centre of the playfield\nis the Geomap which contains the 5 Animals from the upper area.\nSpotting all 5 of these Animals via the Skill Wheel (no doubt\namong others) will start the Stampede Mode.  Don Coons tells me\nthis is a frenzy type mode in which all switches are worth 100K.\n\nFight Bluto Cartel  This is Popeye's addition to the recent Mode craze.\nFortunately there is only 4 of them - Unfortunately, the only\ndifference between them is the animation and the name. During\neach one Bluto is doing something bad and you have to shoot the\nflashing targets to stop him.  It appears that there is no time\nlimit, it's a simple case of you beat him or he beats you. The\n4 Fights are:\n\n\tEarth Pavers  Bluto is building a wall of blocks. Shooting the\ntargets destroys them a few at a time. If the wall gets\nto 15 blocks Bluto wins, 0 and Popeye does. Aim for the\njet bumpers here, each pop smashes 1 block.\n\n\tNever Green Logging  Bluto burns trees, Popeye plants them -\nsix trees on the display is victory for Popeye, none and\nBluto wins.\n\n\tBlutonium Waste  Bluto is dumping waste in the river and Popeye\nremoving it - 6 barrels in and Poeye loses, 0 and he\nwins.  Probably the toughest one this.\n\n\tSpill Oil Co.  Display shows Popeye on the left, Bluto on the\nright and a wall in the middle. Both are waist deep in\noil and cranking a handle to change the oil level.\nWhoever doesn't drown wins ... :)\n\n\nMutant Spinach Multiball  I am led to believe that you enter a mad\n5-ball Multiball upon completion of the four Fight Bluto modes.\nI have no information on it, but am assuming that you actually\nhave to beat Bluto 4 times to start it as opposed to ST:TNG\nwhere just starting a Mission counts toward Final Frontier.\n\nRescue Olive Super Jackpot  Six ball Multiball where the objective is\nto collect all 5 Spinach Cans and then shoot Lockjaw to rescue\nOlive for the Super Jackpot.\n\nThis is almost a carbon copy of the Vacation Jackpot from\nWhiteWater.  To start it, you need to complete the Sea Hag\nMultiball, all 5 Animals, the Bluto Multiball, Find Swea' Pea,\nand the 4 Fight Bluto modes - not an easy task by anybodies\nstandard.  THEN you have to collect the 5 Spinach Cans and\nshoot the Lock to collect the jackpot!\n\nStrategy:\nThe best strategy is to play a different game.  I mean it - this\ngame might appeal to a casual player who never looks at the display and\njust wants to bat a sliver ball around a bit, but anybody who has even a\npassing interest in pinball is likely to be turned off pretty quick.\n\nAnyway, by all accounts this is a one objective game, that objective\nbeing Bluto Multiball which can be started with just 3 shots! (ie Light\nLock from skill shot, shoot lock, repeat).  Once it's going, shoot the\nLeft Ramp for Jackpot then Bluto to relight it.\n\nI don't fully agree with this.  There is good value in Round\nHouse Loops, and Ramp Loops,  and the Animal jackpot is worth 50M so\nis also worthwhile.  Sea Hag Multiball is only really good for spotting\na few targets/loops in quick succession coz it's too hard to complete.\nThere is definitely something on Popeye that is worth points since my\npersonal best is 977M but I have no idea what I shot to get that much!\n\nOne or two tips:\n\n\n Shoot Bluto when unlit.  The Ball Saver is active for the\nkickout so you get a free (random) item from the Skill Wheel.\n\n Avoid Swea' Pea.  When on Kneedeep, hit the standup targets\nthen shoot Super Animal or 2X Wheel.\n\n Play Star Trek: The next Generation instead ... :)\n\nMiscellaneous:\nThis is the odds 'n ends section where I put stuff which does\nnot logically fit anywhere else.  The following comments are mostly my\nopinions/experience and in no particular order:\n\n\n The Skill Shot is ruined by a hardware problem on the local machine.\nThink back to DrWho where a short habitrail fed the right inlane. This\nrail had a nasty piece of blue rubber designed as a stopper for the\nball which caused bad things to happen.  Well, a similar piece exists\nat the end of the habitrail the ball is initially launched up and this\ncauses it to bounce back down to the plunger.  Not only does this make\nthe Skill Shot next to impossible, but it causes big problems during\nMultiball when Sail Again is active. Add a weak plunger to this and\nthe problem is chronic.\n\n On the subject of Sail Again (this is the ball saver), it is active at\nthe start of each ball, and each time a single ball is kicked out of\nLockjaw (different rules apply during Multiball).  This is operator\nsettable and defaults to OFF which is another really bad thing.\n\n The Lock/Kickout arrangement is really bad.  Whether it is due to bad\nsoftware, bad hardware or a combination of both, I don't know, but the\ngame rarely knows how many balls are locked, and often won't register\na hit to the lock at all.\n\n The awards from the Escalator appear to be much better if you are\nhaving a lousy game than if you are having a good one.\n\n Hitting the Swea' Pea gates is harder than you might think since the\ngap between each gate is pretty narrow and there is a lot of rubber\nthere too.\n\n The ball saver timer starts counting as soon as you launch, not as\nsoon as the first switch is hit.  Combined with the above problem,\nI have had balls where Sail Again has timed out before the ball is\nactually in play.\n\n The Fight Bluto timers keep counting even when the ball is out of\nplay ie after a Lockjaw kickout or while selecting an Escalator\naward.  This may, or may not, be a bug.  Whichever way, I don't\nlike it.\n\n Extra ball buy in exists with a limit of one.  Nothing special is\nawarded for using EB buy-in.\n\n EB on the outlane is fairly easy to light by shooting 8 Left Ramps.\nHowever, this is the most ridiculous set up I have seen since you have\nto drain to collect it.  I suppose if you look at it as a kickback\nthen it's not so bad.\n\n Death Saves and Bang Backs are out.\n\n\nNot a lot more I can add really, and since I have no intention\nof putting in any serious time on this machine until I can access it\nduring cheap lock-in sessions, don't expect much more in the way of\nupdates unless somebody out there gets really keen on it or I get to\nplay with it with the glass off for a while.\n\nGood Luck - You'll need it with this one.\n\nAdrian.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Popeye Saves The Earth", "possible_shots": "Sail Again, Left Flipper, Left Slingshot, Left Inlane, Left Outlane, P-O-P Targets, Left Loop, SEA Target, Left Ramp, Animal Sinkhole, Left Jab Target, Lockjaw, Right Jab Target, Jet Bumpers, O-Y-L Rollovers, Fight Bluto Cartel, HAG Target, Right Loop, Escalator, E-Y-E Targets, Right Outlane, Right Inlane, Right Slingshot, Right Flipper, Animals, Kneedeep Playfield, Super Animal Targets, Super Animal exit, Swea' Pea, 2X Wheel exit, Skill Shot Wheel", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/popeye.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Popeye", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

As it happens, I rather like Radical!, so I decided to do a rule sheet\nmyself.  Having played the game a while now, there is a good deal more to it\nthan one might realize at first glance.  Well, better late than never.\n\nRadical! is a 2 ball, 1990 Bally game with four flippers, lots of ramps, a\nskate board theme, and a very \"period\" speech package.  It spans the\ntransition from 80's to 90's games nicely, including both \"classic\" earlier\npinball era features (e.g. long \"Bally\" style flippers, physical ball locks\nwhich can be stolen, random jackpot value, no under playfield troughs) and\n\"modern\" feature (e.g. random award, reflexing, big complex ramps with\ndiverters, stackable modes).  It encourages intense ball-never-stops-moving\ngames, a style of play which I rather like, and it has a slightly cluttered\nplayfield with excellent short, medium and long shots, all of which are\nrequired to do well on the game.\n\nGoal\n\nThe goal of Radical! is to collect the letters in RADICAL (Radical Mode), lock\ntwo balls (Skate or Die Mode), start Multi-Ball Mode, collect the Mega-Million\njackpot, re-lite and re-collect the jackpot.\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nStarting at the left flipper and moving clockwise:\n\nLeft Flipper: Every Radical! I've seen uses the long \"Bally\" style flippers\n(20-9592, despite what the manual says) all the way around.\n\nLeft Kicker: Standard.\n\nLeft Inlane: Standard.\n\nLeft Outlane/Kickback: Standard outlane and kickback.  The Kickback is, by\ndefault, (operator adjustably) lit at the start of the game, and is re-lit by\ncollecting all seven RADICAL letters.  This outlane is also where a random\nSpecial can be collected when lit.\n\nSnake Lane: A narrow \"S\" shaped lane immediately above the Left Outlane which\nservers as one of the entries to the Ball Lock Lane.  Each shot to the Snake\nLane lights a letter in \"SNAKE\", lighting all five letters lights Extra Ball.\n\nBall Lock Lane: A narrow lane on the far left side of the playfield where\nballs are locked for Multi-Ball, or held briefly for light and sound shows.\nIt is fed by the Snake Lane, the Left Ramp (when diverted) and the Right Ramp\n(when not diverted).  It has some rather clever logic designed to keep a\nsecond ball from being locked if lock is not lit.  However, if you are able to\n\"defeat\" this logic and get a second ball locked, you are rewarded with an\n\"instant\" Multi-Ball.\n\nVertical Ramp: Immediately to the right of the Snake Lane is the entrance to\nthe Vertical Ramp.  This ramp faces the Lower Right Flipper, and normally\nreturns the ball to the Left Inlane, but can also drop the ball onto the\nplayfield above the Left Kicker.  The ramp is the first of two Extra Ball\nshots.  5 (operator adjustably) Verticals lites Extra Ball.\n\nLetter Value Advance/Increase: Two standup targets immediately above the right\npost on the Vertical Ramp facing to the right.\n\nLeft Ramp: A wide ramp on the left side of the playfield between the Letter\nValue standup targets and the Upper Left Flipper facing the Upper Right\nFlipper.  A weak shot can exit into the Pop Bumpers.  Diverters can guide the\nball to either the Ball Lock Lane, the Upper Right Flipper (via a second\ndiverter and a whirlpool bowl), or the Lower Right Flipper.  This is the\nMega-Million (jackpot) shot.\n\nUpper Left Flipper: Full sized flipper which is immediately below the bottom\nleft Pop Bumper, pointing nearly straight down.  It faces the lower right Pop\nBumper, the lowest of the Top Drop Targets and the Right Ramp.  This flipper\nis fairly unique in late 80's and 90's pinball machines: there is no ball\nguide of any sort which feeds it.  The only way to send a ball to it is via\nthe Right Orbit, and that shot only feeds it correctly only at fairly high\nball speeds.  All shots made form this flipper are made \"on the fly\", without\nthe aid of a ball guide.\n\nPop Bumpers: Four pop bumpers arranged in two vertical rows, the left row\ndirectly above the Upper Left Flipper, the other row set just slightly higher\nand to the right of this, leaving a lane in between them which leads to the\nTop Spinner and Left Orbit above them.\n\nTop Spinner: A spinner located at the end of the vertical lane between the\nbumpers and at the entrance to Left Orbit and the exit of the Right Orbit.\n\nLeft Orbit: This orbit begins at the Top Spinner and curves to the right\naround behind the Snake Run, running down the right side of the playfield past\nthe entrance to the Right Ramp, exiting at the Bottom Spinner and feeding the\nUpper Right Flipper or the Lower Right flipper.\n\nSnake Run: A short, narrow, hard left curving lane ending with a standup\ntarget.  The entrance is flanked by a \"cone\" of posts.  The Snake Run is the\ngame's random award.\n\nTop Drop Targets: Three drop targets directly below the entrance to the Snake\nRun which block the entrance when they are up.\n\nRight Ramp: A ramp with a steep wide entry on the right side of the playfield\nnear the top right corner.  When not diverted, this ramp feeds the Ball Lock\nLane, but diverted shots (and some slow shots) go instead down the left return\nramp, either to the Upper Right Flipper or, if not diverted at the whirlpool,\nto the Lower Right Flipper.\n\nBottom Drop Targets: A set of three drop targets facing the Lower Left Flipper\nabout two thirds up the right side of the playfield, just inside the right\norbit.\n\nSpot Letter Target: A standup hidden behind the Bottom Drop Targets.\n\nTail Slider Whirlpool: A \"whirlpool\" exit from the left return branch of the\n\"X\" ramp into which a diverter can direct the ball.  This exit feeds the ball\nfairly consistently to the Upper Right Flipper.\n\nRight Spinner: A spinner which ties the Bottom Drop Targets to the ball guide\non the Right Orbit, also about two thirds up the playfield, facing the Lower\nLeft Flipper.  This spinner is the entry point of the Right Orbit.\n\nRight Orbit: Orbit which starts about two thirds up the playfield, just to the\nright of the Bottom Drop Targets, leading up the right side of the playfield,\npast the entrance to the Right Ramp, around the Snake Run and exiting at the\nentrance of the Left Orbit, where, after passing through the pop-bumpers, it\nfeed the Upper Left Flipper.\n\nUpper Right Flipper: A flipper immediately below the Right Spinner at the\nentrance to the Right Orbit.  This flipper can be fed by the Left Orbit, or by\nthe ball finding its way in at the bottom of the entrance to the Right Ramp.\n\nPlunger Lane: A manual Plunger Lane in the normal position, which goes about\nhalf way up the playfield, and which aims towards the Left Ramp, though one\ncan also hit the Letter Value targets and the Upper Left Flipper.\n\nRight Outlane: A harsh, but standard outlane.  This is the second of the two\nExtra Ball \"shots\".  Occasionally, a ball which enters this outlane at the\nright angle and speed will retain enough momentum to travel all the way to the\nKicker switch in the Left Outlane and be fired back into play.\n\nRight Inlane: A narrow inlane that has a gate at the top which keeps balls\nfrom going up and out of the inlane.  For those who, like me, are constantly\ntrying to \"catch\" the ball, this saves many from going \"up\" the inlane and out\nthe outlane.  A nice touch.\n\nModes and Features\n\nRadical! has two \"major\" modes on which multi-ball can be stacked.  In\naddition, it has many of the usual features of pinball games, including a\n\"skill shot\", end-of-ball bonus, extra ball, random award, and so on.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nWhen a ball is served into the Launch Lane, the RADICAL lights just above the\nflippers start cycling quickly.  If you \"make\" the skill shot (up the Left\nRamp), whichever lamp was lit when the ball hit the entry switch is collected.\nThe Skill Shot is not hard, but it can be missed by either under and over\nshooting.\n\nRadical Mode\n\nThe main task of Radical! is to light the RADICAL letters (centered just above\nthe flippers), which in turn lights Skate or Die (i.e., Multi-Ball lock mode),\nwhich in turn starts Multi-Ball Mode (after the second lock), during which\nMega Million is lit and can be collected (and re-lit and re-collected; see\nMulti-Ball Mode below).\n\nRADICAL letters are associated with, and collected by making all of the major\nplayfield shots:\n\n\n R: Snake Lane\n A: Vertical Ramp\n D: Top Spinner/Left Orbit\n I: Right Ramp\n C: Bottom Drop Targets\n A: Left Ramp\n L: Right Spinner/Right Orbit\n\n\nRADICAL letters can also be spotted by the Skill Shot, by the Spot Letter\ntarget (behind the Bottom Drop Targets) when lit, and (operator adjustably) by\nthe Inlanes.  By default, the skill shot and inlanes only work while\ncollecting RADICAL letters for the first ball to be locked.\n\nRADICAL letters are worth 20K, 40K, 60K, 80K, 100K, 500K, or 1M.  These Letter\nValues start at 20K, and are advanced by collecting a letter, or by hitting\nboth the Letter Value Advance/Increase targets.  Each value, once lit\n(operator adjustably) times out after a few seconds.  Collecting all seven\nletters is therefore worth between 140K and 1.74M.\n\nThe Letter Advance/Increase targets are only lit after the Letter Value has\ndecreased a step.  [It appears to take hitting both to advance/increase the\nletter value, though it may be that one \"advances\" the value, and the other\n\"increases\" the timeout?]\n\nCollecting all seven letters does several things:\n\n\n starts Snake or Die Mode\n turns on the Kickback (if it is off)\n lights \"Bottom Million\" (see Millions)\n advances the Outhole Bonus by 100K\n\n\nSkate or Die Mode\n\nThis is the Multi-Ball \"lock mode\", which is accompanied by more good music\nand a menacing (annoying?) voice which likes to repeat \"Skate, Or, Die\" rather\na lot.\n\nWhen lit, either by collecting all seven RADICAL letters or as a random award\nfrom the Snake Run, no RADICAL letters can be collected (though Snake Run\nstill can be).  The three Skate or Die (ball lock) shots are the Snake Lane,\nthe Left Ramp and the Right Ramp.\n\nWhen the first ball is locked during Snake or Die, the RADICAL letters and\nLetter Values reset, a new ball is served to the launch lane, and one starts\nworking on collecting a second set of RADICAL letters.  The second set of\nRADICAL letters requires a little more work than the first since neither the\nskill shot nor the Inlanes spot letters the second time around.  Locking the\nsecond balls starts Multi-Ball Mode.\n\nIt is also possible, with an element of luck, to lock the second ball, and\nhence start Multi-Ball without collecting all of the RADICAL letters.\nThis can only happen if the clever logic of the Lock Lane is defeated by\nphysics (or possibly by a bad switch or two).  Normally, when a second ball is\non its way to the Lock Lane, the ball which is already there is kicked out so\nthat only one ball stays in the lane.  If for some reason, the kickout fails\nand both balls end up in the Lock Lane, you start Multi-Ball\nimmediately.  Further, the RADICAL letters which were lit when Multi-Ball\nstarted, will still be lit after the Mega-Million jackpot is collected (or one\nball drains).\n\nMulti-Ball/Mega-Million Mode\n\nWhen a second ball is locked in the Ball Lock Lane, the Multi-Ball Mode music\nstarts, a random Mega-Million (jackpot) between 3M and 10M is chosen, and\nMulti-Ball Mode begins.\n\nThe lit Mega-Million shot is the Left Ramp, which remains lit for a short\n(operator adjustable) time after one ball drains.\n\nWhen the Mega-Million shot is made, the ball is diverted into the Lock Lane,\nand there is a very cool count down of the jackpot accompanied by glaring\nlights and blaring sounds for each million of the three to ten million points\ncollected.\n\nHowever, unlike Radical Mode and Skate or Die mode, which are mutually\nexclusive, Multi-Ball Mode is (always) stacked on top one of these modes.\n\nInitially, Multi-Ball Mode is stacked on top of the normal Radical Mode with\nonly a few differences.  Specifically, the Left Ramp is lit for Mega-Million\ninstead of the second A in RADICAL.  However, once Mega-Million is collected,\nthe Left Ramp is once again available for collecting the A and Tail Sliders.\nNote that even if Mega-Million has not been collected, it is nonetheless\npossible to collect the A via the Inlanes or Spot Letter.\n\nOnce Mega-Million has been collected, it can be re-lit by collecting all seven\nRADICAL letters and locking both balls in the Ball Lock Lane within 3\nor so seconds of each other.  That is, during Multi-Ball, Skate or Die Mode is\nused to re-lite Mega-Million rather that to lock balls.\n\nOnce a ball has drained, your game picks up where it left off in Radical Mode.\nThat is, if you locked both balls the conventional way, you start collecting\nletters again from scratch.  If you happened to start Multi-Ball by defeating\nthe Lock Lane kickout logic, what ever letters were lit then remain lit when\nyou get back to Radical Mode.\n\nMillions\n\nIn addition to the Mega-Million jackpot, there are four ways to score a\nmillion points with a single shot.\n\n\n Shooting the Right Ramp when \"Top Million\" is lit.\n Shooting the Spot Letter target (behind the Bottom Drop\n     Targets) when \"Bottom Million\" is lit.\n Collecting a RADICAL letter the Letter Value is \"1 Million\".\n Getting the \"One Million\" random award for the Snake Run.\n\n\nTop Million is lit (operator adjustably) at the start of every game.  It is\nre-lit when Snake Run is made.\n\nBottom Million is an (operator adjustable) hurry-up lit by collecting all\nseven RADICAL letters (see Radical Mode).\n\nLetter Value One Million is lit by collecting the first six RADICAL letters\nbefore any of the Letter Value lamps have timed out or by advancing the Letter\nValues (see Radical Mode).\n\nSnake Run\n\nSnake Run is Radical!'s random award.  Completing the Top Drop Targets lights\na timed Snake Run hurry-up.  Making either the Snake Run or the Snake Lane\nstarts a nice light and sound show, and awards one of the following:\n\n\n Skate or Die       -- Starts Skate or Die\n Extra Ball         -- Awards Extra Ball\n Award Tail Sliders -- Awards 25K * number of Tail Sliders\n Award Verticals    -- Awards 25K * number of Verticals\n Mystery Score      -- 50K - 250K\n One Million        -- Nice light show (and a million points)\n\n\nThe relative length of the hurry-up and the relative percentage of these\nawards is operator adjustable.\n\nIn addition to giving one of these random awards, making the Snake Run also\nre-lites Top Million (see Millions).\n\nTail Sliders\n\nWhen lit, a Tail Slider is a self feeding looping shot from the Upper Right\nFlipper to the Left Ramp.  Tail Sliders are accompanied by \"gnarly\" music and\n\"totally awesome\" quotes, and score 100k each.  After the first two\n[consecutive] Tail Sliders, the ball is diverted to the Lock Lane.\nSubsequently, it is diverted after three [consecutive] Tail Sliders, then\nfour, and so on.\n\nTail Slider is lit by collecting the second A in RADICAL.\n\nA really fast shot to the Left Ramp can on occasion sneak by the Tail Slider\ndiverter and instead exit at the Right Inlane.\n\nThe number of Tail Sliders collected is tracked, and can be collected (* 25k)\nas one of the random awards given by the Snake Run.\n\nVertical Ramp\n\nThe Vertical Ramp awards the first A in RADICAL, and lights the 50K lamp which\nalternates between the left and right Inlanes.  Further, this ramp exits above\nthe Left Inlane switch (unlike the Right Inlane ramp exit), which means it can\n(operator adjustably) spot RADICAL letters.\n\nBy default, 5 Verticals lights a 5 second Extra Ball hurry-up (which\nsubsequently transfers to the Right Outlane for another 5 seconds).  This can\nbe turned off by the operator.\n\nThe number of Verticals collected is tracked, and can be collected as one of\nthe random awards (* 25k) given by making the Snake Run.\n\nDrop Targets\n\nCompleting the Top Drop Targets lights the Snake Run (see above) and advances\nBonus X.  Completing the Bottom Drop Targets either collects the \"C\" or lights\nthe (usually hidden) Spot Letter target.  This hidden target can also award\n\"Bottom Million\" if it is lit.  It is well worth hammering both sets of drop\ntargets.\n\nExtra Ball\n\nExtra Ball can be lit either by making 5 Verticals or by lighting the five\nSNAKE lamps in the Snake Lane.  It is a 5 second hurry-up, first at the\nVertical Ramp, then, when that times out, another 5 seconds at the Right\nOutlane.  (Lighting Extra Ball via Verticals can be turned off by the\noperator.)  An Extra Ball can be collected as one of the random awards given\nby making the Snake Run.  The SNAKE lamps in the Snake Lane are reset at the\nstart of each ball.\n\nBonus\n\nThe Outhole Bonus Multiplier is advanced 1X at a time to a maximum of 5X by\ncompleting the Top Drop Target Bank.\n\nEach RADICAL letter collected adds 10K to the Outhole Bonus, and each\ncompletion of all seven RADICAL letters adds 100K, up to a maximum of 400K.\nBy default, this value is cumulative across balls, but optionally can be set\nto reset at the start of each ball.\n\nThe bonus awarded is the product of these two values, maxing out at 2M (400K *\n5X).  The number of times this is collected is tracked in the audits.\n\nNotes\n\nRadical! is typical Bally \"style\" System 11C game with the tall Bally backbox\nwith the speakers at the top and the two \"inline\" 16 digit displays at the\nbottom.  No under-playfield troughs means the game runs very clean and is\nrelatively simple despite the rather interesting and (in my opinion) complex\nplay.  It has a good light show all around, and I rather like the \"Xtreme\"\nrock music and the \"bitchin\" period speech package.  In particular, I really\nlike the music for starting Multi-Ball mode, Tail Sliders, Snake Run, and for\nsetting a high score.  Cool man.\n\nI've heard that some people don't like the random Mega-Million jackpot award\nor the fact that locked balls can be stolen in multi-player games.\nPersonally, I like these features.  For players of similar skill and\ntemperament, it can make some of the games of this era a blast -- lots of\nyelling and screaming and laughing.\n\nTechnically, Radical! doesn't have any \"combinations\" (in the modern \"timed\nsequence awarding extra points\" sense), but there are several shots which can\nonly reliably be made as combinations.  For example, the Right Ramp can only\nbe made from the Upper Left Flipper, which can only be feed reliably setup\nfrom the Lower Left Flipper via the Right Orbit.  Each flipper has one or\nshots that, either via a ramp, an orbit or a lane, feed another flipper,\ncombinations are simply natural on this machine.  This encourages a style of\nfast, flowing game play in which the ball rarely if ever stops, but in which\nit is possible to can keep control of the ball as it covers nearly the whole\nplayfield.  The only shots which require loss of ball control are the two sets\nof drop targets, which, fortunately, are absolutely required if you really\nwant to do well.\n\nScoring over 100,000,000 points is not noted by the game.  That is, once the\ngame rolls, you are starting over with regard to points.  This means you can\nwin another game on  points, but unless you pass the high score again, you will\nnot post a new high score.\n\nOccasionally during particularly intense play -- e.g. starting Skate or Die\nand collecting Snake run at virtually the same time -- the sound and/or\nfeature lamps get confused and simply stop doing anything until the next mode\nor ball starts.  I've seen this happen a few time, so it may well be a\nreproducible bug.\n\nA VUK in the upper left corner (fed by a trough via the Snake Run) and a third\nkicker (adjacent to and above the Bottom Drop Targets, facing the Pop Bumpers)\nare shown in the manual (switches and all), but clearly did not make it to the\nproduction run.\n\nchrisp@csufresno.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Radical!", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/radical.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Radical!", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Rescue 911\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Rescue 911\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRescue 911 rules sheet,\nversion 2.0 (July 10, 1994)\nAuthor: Michael Dunn\n\n\nChanges from version 1.0\nAt long last, I found a place that has R911!  So this is a bigger and\nbetter version than 1.0 -- I added info to just about every section of the\nrules.  Most notably: I found a couple of standup targets that I hadn't noticed\nbefore, made it clearer which targets are in which portion of the playfield,\nand FINALLY figured out how the modes and Multiball interact.  Also, to the\nbest of my knowledge, Neil Shatz's name is still spelled correctly. :>\nGeneral Stuff\nJust a reminder that while I now have access to R911, it's a pain to get\nto it, so I'm relying on the kind Internet folks to help me out.  Kevin\nMartin, Bowen Kerins and Michael Falkner have given me lots of helpful info.\nThe Multiball exploit section uses info from Kevin and Keith Johnson.  When I'm\ndescribing something that I have unconfirmed or conflicting info about, I'll\nusually say who gave me that info.  This is more for me, so I can keep track\nof who told me what.  If you have confirmation or clarification of anything\nin this sheet, please feel free to e-mail me. :>\n\nThe first time I saw this machine was at the Pinathon on May 14, where\nR911 was the game we played in the final round.\n\nMany many many thanks go to Neil Shatz.  He was in the final round too,\nand he was the only one who knew anything about the game.  Before the finals\nstarted, we were all crowded around the machine while Neil was giving us a\nquick briefing.  It was quite a sight to see ;>\n\nSince this is a Gottlieb game, there are a few quirks I should tell you\nabout.  R911 has \"hurry-up\" shots, but they are what we'd normally call shots\nthat time-out.   R911 also has \"countdown\" shots, and those are true hurry-up\nshots, i.e. their values decrease over time.  I'll be using \"hurry-up\" and\n\"countdown\" the way R911 uses them.  All normal r.g.p abbreviations apply, too.\n\nThere are also a couple of things that don't have common names, so I\ninvented names for them here.  One is a standup-kicker.  It's a double-wide\nstandup target that kicks the ball like a slingshot when it's hit.  The other\nis a \"one-time\" shot.  This is a shot that is lit by doing something, but which\nturns off if any other target is hit first (Bowen helped with this name).\nGeneral Layout\nThe playfield is divided into three areas.  The lower half of the board\nhas the highest-scoring targets.  The upper left quarter is the bumper area,\nand the upper right quarter has the top flipper, lock shots, and a mode start\nshot.\n\nThe upper two quarters of the playfield are separated by a wall, so the\nball can't go directly between those areas unless it goes airborne (but I've\nnever seen that happen).  There is a lane leading from the lower half to each\nof the upper quarters.  The ball can be dropped off the Helicopter into the\nbumper area, and the Ramp feeds the ball to the Top Flipper.\n\n Lower Half of the Board \n\n Left in/outlanes   The setup is tough to describe.  The inlane is wider at the\ntop than the bottom, but the surrounding rubber and posts tend to steer the\nball to the outlane.  The inlane lights \"Hook & Ladder\" for a one-time shot\nat the ramp.  The outlane can be lit for a Special.\n\n Advance X target  This is a single standup target, at a similar angle as the\nRetina Scan ball in DM.  This target lights every 3 slingshot and/or bumper\nhits.  Hitting the target does NOT unlight it.\n\n E-K-G standups   Completing the targets advances the bumper value for a short\ntime.  Sometimes, one target will be flashing, and other times you'll need\nto hit all three.  Once you start to re-run modes, hitting the K target\nrelights the Helicopter.\n\n Helipad  This is a U-turn lane.  It can be hit with either flipper, but due to\nthe way the lane is constructed, it's easier to backhand it with the left\nflipper.  At the end of the lane is a kicker that sends the ball back out\nthe lane, and a post that raises the ball up so it can be picked up by the\nhelicopter.  If the machine is clean & fast, the ball may have a tendancy to\nspin out of the lane if it's shot in quickly.  The lights at the Helipad\nare, from top to bottom: Advance Jackpot, Activate Helicopter, Collect\nJackpot, Call 9-1-1.\n\n Captive Balls  This is definitely the 2nd coolest thing in the game, second\nonly to the helicopter. :>  There are three captive balls in a short\nstraight lane with a standup at the end.  The ball closest to the player and\nfarthest from the player are clear (plastic maybe?), and the middle ball is\nsteel.  What's cool is that when the captive balls are available in a mode,\nlights under the balls turn on, so the lower ball turns red and the upper\nball turns blue.  There two bonuses called \"red value\" and \"blue value\"\nwhich are alternately available here during one-ball play.  Shooting the\ncaptive balls collects the lit value (up to 60M max).  The lit bonus\nalternates every few seconds.  Be careful, though, since missing this shot\nto either side can lead to a SDTM drain.  Lights are Hurry-up EB, Red Value,\nBlue Value.\n\n Middle Standup  This is a white standup target.  The lanes leading to the upper\nportions of the playfield run by either side of this target.  When hit, it\nadds 3M to the currently lit bonus (blue or red).  It is lit for a hurry-up\n30M at 20 lives and after every 6th mode.  The red and blue bonus lights\nalternate every few seconds, just as the captive ball lights do.  The bonus\nlit here will be the same color as the one lit at the captive balls.  This\nis also a potential drain shot.  But when it's lit for 30M, it's definitely\nworth the risk.  Lights are Hurry-up 30M, Blue Bonus, Red Bonus.\n\n Ramp  The entrance to the ramp is at a weird angle -- it looks identical to the\nright ramp on Cactus Jack.  Once the ball makes it up the ramp, it goes\nstraight all the way back to the back side of the playfield and falls into a\nlane that feeds the top flipper.  There is a post in the lane that catches\nthe ball if an award needs to be displayed.  The ramp can score Player's\nChoice, advance \"Hook & Ladder\", score Med-Alert (a random award), save\nlives in modes, and start Life Force.  Lights are Player's Choice,\nMed-Alert, Hook & Ladder.\n\n Rescue target  This standup-kicker faces left, and is below the ramp entrance.\nIt adds letters in RESCUE when lit, which when built up lights Player's\nChoice at the Ramp.  (There is a long story behind this target, which I'll\nspare you.  Mail me if you really want to know about it. :)\n\n Right in/outlanes  Same setup as the left side.  The inlane lights the Rescue\ntarget.  The outlane can be lit for a Special.\n\n Plunger  A manual plunger.  There is a bwee skill shot--three lights in the\nplunger lane (advance X, 10M, flipper shot) are lit in order.  You launch\nthe ball, and whatever is lit when the ball hits a switch in the habitrail,\nyou get.  The ball is fed to the right flipper after it's launched.  If you\nget \"Flipper shot\" from the plunger, one of the following shots will be lit\nfor a one-time shot: captive balls, standup-kicker in the bumpers, middle\nstandup.  Shooting the lit shot scores 20M.  (The shot doesn't light\nimmediately, so you need to catch the ball and wait before shooting.)  On\nthe machine we played, if you launched the ball at full strength it would\nsometimes fall off the habitrail and back to the plunger.\n\n Mode lights  There are 7 lights. 6 in a row, one for each mode, and one below\nthem that lights when the Life Force mode is available.  The lights work as\nusual: completed modes are lit solidly, the currently available mode is\nflashing.\n\n Slings and flippers  Two of each, in the normal places.  Balls coming from the\nPlunger and Main Habitrail are fed directly to the flippers, and are always\ncatchable.  The slings are rectangular, instead of the more common triangle\nshape, which makes the inlanes angled toward the center of the board.  This\nalso makes outlane drains more likely.  If the left flipper becomes weak,\ncomplain, since if you can't hit the Ramp you lose many chances for points\nand lives.\n\n\n Bumper Area: Upper Left quarter of the board \n\n Bumpers  There are three very funny-looking flat-top jet bumpers.  At least\nthey SOUND like jets--not like that wimpy sound that DE bumpers make. ;>\nThere is also a standup-kicker that counts as a bumper for scoring purposes.\nThe only way out of this area is down a lane between the captive balls and\nthe middle standup target.  The bumpers are used in the Hostage mode.  Each\nhit to a bumper during one-ball, non-Hostage mode play adds 100K, 500K, or\n3M to your end of ball bonus.  The value is increased by hitting the Cave-in\nStandup or completing E-K-G.  Lights are 3M, 500K, 100K, to indicate the\nbumper value.\n\n Random Standup  There is a white standup target to the right of the\nstandup-kicker.  It makes a neat sound when hit.  What does it do?  Who\nknows.\n\n Left helicopter dropoff point  If the ball is not dropped off the helicopter by\nthe player, it will automatically be released here when the helicopter\ncompletes its flight.  The ball rolls under some plastic mountains and onto\nthe habitrail that feeds the left flipper.\n\n Back helicopter dropoff hole  This is a sinkhole behind the bumper\nstandup-kicker target.  The only time the ball is supposed to fall in here\nis when it's dropped off the helicopter at the start of a mode.  Hitting\nthis hole will credit a shot to the Emergency Room if that shot is part of\nthe mode. The ball will be kicked out of the Lock Sinkhole.\n\n Right helicopter dropoff hole  This is a hole in the plastic to the right of\nthe bumpers.  If the ball is dropped off the helicopter into this hole, it\nwill roll nicely into the bumpers.  This hole is only useful in the Hostage\nmode.\n\n\n Top Flipper area : Upper right quarter of the board \n\n Top flipper   There is a full-size flipper way up near the top right corner of\nthe board, at the exit from the ramp.  It is used to hit the cave-in\ntargets, the Lock Sinkhole, and the Emergency Room.\n\n Cave-in targets   Two drop targets covering a single standup target.  They are\nused in the Cave-in mode.  During normal play, hitting the standup advances\nthe bumper value for a short time.  When both targets are hit, two red globe\nlights on the plastic above the targets will flash to indicate a timer.\nWhen they time-out, the drop targets will reset.\n\n Lock sinkhole  This is one place to lock balls and start modes.  Balls are\nkicked back out of the sinkhole onto the main habitrail.  Lights are Lock,\nCall 9-1-1.\n\n Emergency Room lane   This is a very tough shot due to the low angle and the\nbend halfway up the lane.  This shot scores \"Progressive Award\", collects\njackpots, and locks balls.  Balls that are shot up this lane are kicked up\nout of the Lock Sinkhole.  Lights are Lock, Emergency Room, Collect Jackpot.\n\n Dispatch Target  I didn't notice this while I was playing; Kevin had to tell me\nit was there. :>  It's below the entrance to the Emergency Room, and scores\n2 lives when lit.  It is lit after you complete all the modes once.\n\n Enigmatic Standups  There are 4 white standups on the right side of the lane\nleading to the Top Flipper area.  There are no lights pointing at them, and\nthey are not labeled at all. *shrug*  I like Bowen's explanation of these\ntargets: they originally spelled TREK, in reference to William Shatner and\nStar Trek:TOS, but Gottlieb didn't get the rights to use Shatner's voice in\nthe game. :> \n\n\n Above the board \n\n Main habitrail  This is the habitrail that carries balls that are kicked out of\nthe Lock Sinkhole.  There is a post near the top end of the trail that holds\nlocked balls (think SF2).  The trail crosses the board and joins up with the\nplastic trail that leads from the Left helicopter dropoff point, and then\nfeeds the left flipper.\n\n Helicopter  This is the game's cool toy.  It is normally parked above the\nbumper area, but when you start a mode at the Helipad when the Helicopter\nlight is lit, the Helicopter will fly down and pick the ball up.  See the\ndescription above of the 3 dropoff points for more info.  The Helicopter\nlight is always lit the first time through the modes, but for later modes\nyou must hit the K target (in the E-K-G bank) to light the Helicopter.\n\nMultiball\nMultiball can be started in two ways.  Locking two balls in the Main\nHabitrail will start 3-ball multiball when you launch the third ball.  The\nother way is to start Cave-In or Jaws of Life during your first run through the\nmodes.  Getting multiball this way will start a 2-ball multiball if there is\nnot a ball locked in the Main Habitrail, and 3-ball if there is a ball locked\nthere.  (Note, you don't actually have to play Cave-In or Jaws of Life.  See\nthree paragraphs down for more info.)\n\nThe object of Multiball is to collect jackpots.  The first jackpot can be\ncollected either at the Helipad or the Emergency Room.  After that, only the\nEmergency Room awards jackpots; the Helipad increases the jackpot value.  The\njackpot starts at 10M.  Each shot to the Helipad to increase the jackpot adds\n30M, and collecting a jackpot makes the next jackpot double the value of the\none just collected.  The jackpot value maxes at 300M.\n\nHere's how Multiball and modes interact: they don't.  The two are totally\nindependent.  You can start a mode during Multiball, and Jaws of Life and\nCave-In automatically start Multiball the first time through the modes.\n\nBut, here's an exploit.  At the beginning of a ball, select Jaws of Life or\nCave-In.  Then shoot a mode start.  That will lock a ball and serve another to\nthe plunger.  Before you launch that ball, select one of the other modes.  That\nnew mode will be the one you play, but it will be Multiball.  So the end effect\nis that you can have Multiball up to 6 times the first time through the modes.\n(But don't do this with Stork EB, it's hard enough as it is without balls\nflying around and hitting each other.)\n\nWhen a mode is started during Multiball, or when a mode starts Multiball,\nand if the Helicopter is lit, the ball will always be dropped in the Left\nDropoff point.  However, if you drain the other one or two balls (however many\nwere locked) before the Helicopter picks up the ball in the Helipad, you will\nbe able to control when the ball is dropped.  Also, when a mode starts\nMultiball with the Helicopter lit, you can shoot the ball coming off the\nplunger into the Helipad for a jackpot and take a quick break while the\nHelicopter does its business of picking up the locked ball.\n\nOne last note: the Bumpers do NOT add to your end of ball bonus during\nMultiball.\nModes\nThe modes are all pretty straightforward.  When you start a mode, some\nshots will be flashing.  Shoot them to save lives.  Don't look at the display\nfor help, though--you have to rely on the lights to know what to shoot for.\n\nTo start a mode, shoot one of the \"Call 9-1-1\" shots--either the Helipad\nor the Lock Sinkhole.  The first time through the modes, both mode start shots\nare lit, but afterwards, the lit shot alternates with each bumper and slingshot\nhit.  If you shoot the Helipad, and the Helicopter light is lit, the helicopter\nwill swoop down and pick up the ball.  You must release the ball by pressing\neither flipper button.  Dropping the ball in the Back dropoff hole saves 1\nlife, and counts as a shot to the Emergency Room.  If you don't drop the ball,\nit will be dropped in the Left Dropoff point, which won't award any lives.\n\nWhenever the ball is at the plunger, you can use the flippers to choose\nwhich mode will be available first.  It's similar to Dr. Who, where you could\nchoose which Doctor bonus was in effect.\n\nThe Helicopter will be lit at the start of each ball the first time\nthrough the modes.  After that, it will be lit for you at the start of a ball\n*unless* you choose Stork EB before launching the ball.  But that's no big\ndeal, really, since the Helicopter is pretty easy to light.\n\nThe Helicopter will also automatically relight after every mode during the\nfirst time through the modes.\n\nWhen you start a mode, there are some pretty good sound effects that\nsimulate a call to 9-1-1 emergency.  They describe a situation in which lives\nare in danger.  Shooting the flashing shots saves lives.  Unfortunately, the\nsounds don't tell you WHAT exactly to shoot.\n\nJaws of Life and Cave-In are automatically multiball modes the first time\nthrough the modes.  They are usually 2-ball, but if you have locked one ball on\nthe main Habitrail beforehand, they will be 3-ball.\n\nThere are actually some instructions on how to play the modes, but the\ntrouble is that they are only available during attract mode!  Hold down both\nflippers to see them.  I haven't had the chance to write them down yet, so if\nyou have any info to add here, please email me.\n\nHere are the modes.  All modes last for 15 seconds or until all the\nrelevant shots are hit.\n\n Stork EB \nShoot the Emergency Room (or drop the ball into the Top Dropoff hole)\nwithin 15 seconds.  Doing so lights the EB at the Captive Balls on a 5 second\ntimer.  The mode ends when either timer expires or you collect the \"Extra Bawl\"\n(har har).\n\n Flash Flood \nThe following shots are lit: Emergency Room, Helipad, Captive Balls,\nMiddle Standup, Ramp.  Successive shots to lit targets score token points and\n2, 4, 6, 8, and then 10 lives.\n\n Wild Fires \nThe following shots are lit: Emergency Room, Helipad, Ramp.  Each shot\nscores 2 (?) lives and collects your end-of-ball bonus.\n\n Jaws of Life \nShoot the Middle Standup for 10M and 2 lives, then the ramp for 20M and 4\nlives, then the Captive Balls for 30M and 6 lives, and finally the Lock\nSinkhole for 100M and 10 lives.\n\n Cave-in \nShoot the Cave-in drop targets to save 2 lives each, and the standup\ntarget for 10 lives.  Simple, eh?  The drop targets do not reset until the mode\nends.\n\n Hostage \nThis is the mode where you should drop the ball from the helicopter into\nthe Right dropoff point.  Each bumper hit adds to a meter in the display.  4\nhits will fill the meter, which counts as two lives.  Hitting the Captive Balls\nsaves 4 lives.  During this mode, the Bumpers do NOT add to your end of ball\nbonus.\n\n Life Force (Wizard bonus) \nWhen you have saved 50 lives, shoot the ramp.  A really nice sound and\nlight show starts.  All the major shots flash in time to a heartbeat sound.\n(It's similar to the Metamorphosis effects on Bride of Pinbot.)  There is a\n30-second timer running, and hitting one of the following shots awards 1M and a\nneat sound effect (but no special display): EKG Targets (hitting one target is\nenough), Helipad, Captive Balls, Middle Standup, Ramp, Rescue standup-kicker.\nHitting a shot unlights it, and hitting all 6 awards 300M.  Once again, the\ndisplay is totally useless, no instructions, no hints, no nothing.  *shrug*\n\nStrategy tip: When the ball comes off the Ramp, let it fall down to the\nlower part of the board.  There's nothing worth hitting at the top of the\nplayfield.\n\nAt 120 lives, Super Life Force is available.  It's the same as Life Force,\nexcept that an additional shot to the emergency room is required, and\nthe bonus for hitting all shots is 1B!\n\n Saving Lives \nOK, I've been talking about saving lives all this time...here's how they\nwork.  Lives are a sort of count-up feature, but they're also designed to be\nthe Life Force wizard bonus.  The catch is that you have to actually play the\nmodes; you can't just hold the ball and let the mode timers run out.  Awards\nyou get for saving lives are: Light hurry-up 30M at 20 lives, light hurry-up EB\nat 35 lives, start Life Force at 50 lives, start Super Life Force at 120\n(although I have also heard 125 and 150).\n\nAt the end of the game, you get a bonus of (100K * last ball's bonus\nmultiplier) for each life you saved during you game.  There is also a place on\nthe high scores table for the most lives saved.  Beating the old record for\nmost lives saved awards a special.  Kevin says that lives max out at 255, after\nwhich only Multiball is worth going for.\nOther Scoring\n\n Hurry-Up 30M and EB  Pay attention to how many lives you have!  There are NO\nspecial sounds or eye-catching displays when you light either of these\nshots, and if the shot happens to be lit for a mode, it's tough to tell if\nthe Hurry-Up award is lit.  So, after each mode, take time to check the\nstatus report, and if you're getting close to lighting either of these\nshots, stay alert for the rapidly flashing Hurry-Up lights.\n\n Bonus Multipliers  The multiplier can be advanced by the Plunger, the Advance X\ntarget, or a Med-Alert award.  The multiplier goes from 1x to 2x, 3x, and\nfinally 5x.\n\n Progressive Award  Shooting the Emergency Room when it's not lit for anything\nscores the \"Progressive Award\".  Awards are 2M, then 5M, then light Hurry-up\nEB, then 10M for the rest of the ball.\n\n Med-Alert  This is a random award.  Shoot the ramp to collect it.  It's lit at\nthe start of each ball an at the end of each mode.  Awards include: EB,\nHurry-up EB, 1 life, 3 lives, 5 lives, various points, 10M, 30M, 100M(!),\nadvance \"Hook & Ladder\", Instant Multiball, 20M Countdown (at the Cave-in\nStandup), Advance Blue Bonus, Advance Red Bonus, Bumpers at Max, Advance\nMultiplier, Multiplier at Max, and Light Special.\n\n Player's Choice  Spelling RESCUE lights the Ramp to collect Player's Choice.\nThe only awards are Super Countdown (50M at the Cave-in standup) and 5\nlives.\n\n \"Hook & Ladder\"  This is a carry-over feature, similar to RANSOM in BK2K and\nWILLIAMS in Rollergames.  The Left Inlane lights the ramp to spot the next\nletter (this is a one-time shot).  This is a multiball round, where every\nswitch scores 3M, and the max you can get during the round is about 300M.\nThe total is awarded at the end of the ball.  In all, there are 11 letters,\nand one letter is spotted automatically at the end of each game, unless\nthere are already 10 letters lit, in which case nothing is spotted.\n\n Fun with Bonus  The only thing that adds to your bonus is the bumpers.  Bowen\nhas reported having a 50M (well, 5OM actually) bonus!  Is there a limit?\n\n Outlane specials  I've never seen them lit.\n\nAbuse during Multiball\nIn addition to the exploit that lets you play every mode as a Multiball the\nfirst time through the modes, you can exploit the jackpot shots once Multiball is\ngoing.\n\nCatch one ball on each flipper.  Shoot the ramp with the left flipper,\nthen pass the other ball to the left flipper, and catch the ball coming off the\nramp on the top-right flipper.  Shoot the jackpot.\n\nAfterwards, it's easy.  Shoot the ramp, catch that ball on the top\nflipper, and catch the ball you just shot into the jackpot lane as it comes off\nthe main habitrail.\n\nIf you happen to have one ball in the upper flipper and the other on the\nlower right flipper, you can still shoot the Emergency Room lane while holding\nthe ball on the lower flipper, because the flipper button has the same\ntwo-stage control as on Williams games (except DM).\nTournament Settings\nThe bonus for completing Life Force is 100M.  The bonus for Super Life\nForce is 300M.\n\nMaximum jackpots for Multiball are 100M, and the Helipad advances jackpots\nby 10M.\n\nEach player's \"Hook & Ladder\" sequence is kept separately, and always\nbegins at the \"a\".\n\nOur games at the Pinathon were supposedly played under tournament rules,\nbut after reading Bowen's and Kevin's mail, I'm not so sure now.  Among other\nthings, extra balls were awarded!\nClosing Remarks\nWell, I always wanted to maintain a rule sheet for a new game. :)  Thanx\ngo out to the folks at the Pinathon for giving me the chance to see some new\n(and old) Gottliebs that I'd only heard of before.\n\nPost passing works fine, but if the flipper rubbers are new, they may\ncreate too much friction and prevent the ball from rolling over to the other\nflipper.  Rick Stetta did a few lane passes, though.  (That really knocked my\nsocks off--I'd never seen a lane pass before. :)  Bounce passes work fine.\n\nAll in all, I feel the game has potential, but play is ruined by bad\ndisplays and a lack of instructions during modes.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Rescue 911", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/rescue911.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Rescue 911", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Obviously this is not\ncomplete and is probably going to skip over some details. More information\nabout the game can be found directly at http://www.pinball.wms.com/games/revenge/\nand http://www.pinball2000.com.\nPlease note the following change in this latest version:\nThis rulesheet may be reproduced as-is, but not edited without\nprior permission or sold, as long as the credits remain intact. Feel free\nto e-mail me with changes or additions.\n\nCredits\n\nThanks to the following people who helped with this rulesheet: John\nZmaczynski (jjz@tezcat.com), Keith Johnson, Greg Dunlap (gdd@tezcat.com),\nLee P.\n(leep@infinet.com), Therese\nEdwards (tntgame@netwalk.com), Graham West, Brian Lutz\n(emurumor@rocketmail.com), Josh Sharpe (PinWizJ@aol.com - Attack Mars and\nsome other mode information borrowed from his rulesheet), Amy\nRyan (eighmi@access1.net), Matt Magnasco (matt@r44h56.res.gatech.edu),\nDavid Gersic (dgersic@niu.edu), Scott Tiesma (tiesma@pclink.com),\nSvante Ericsson (Svante.Ericsson@sab.siemens.se), Joe Schober\n(AFLJoeyS@aol.com), Marc Jeray (madmac@babba.advancenet.net), Christopher\nHeckman (checkman@math.gatech.edu).\n\nBackground/Objective\n\nRevenge From Mars is the Pinball 2000 sequel to the popular Attack From\nMars pinball machine which came out in late 1995. The goal in Attack From\nMars was to defend the Earth from martian invasion and ultimately defeat\nthem to Rule The Universe. Revenge From Mars, as noted by the title,\nbrings these martians back again for another round of fun. The objective\nhere is to Attack Mars once again. Specifically this is achieved by\nlighting all 9 Saucer lights, completing the Bonus Wave multiballs (Fuel,\nSaucer and Weapons), and getting Mothership Multiball. Once these have\nbeen completed, Attack Mars will light.\n\nNotes\n\nThe latest software revision for Revenge From Mars is 1.4 and is referred\nto whenever possible throughout the rulesheet unless where specifically\nstated. The default difficulty setting is Medium--there is also Easy and\nHard (and Extra Easy and Extra Hard).\n\nFeatures\n\nSince this is the beginning of the new Pinball 2000 series, there is much\nin the way of new features for this game. Many of these features will no\ndoubt appear in future Pinball 2000 games, so they will be noted here\nbriefly in\nrelation to the game only. Various other technical aspects involving the\ndesign can be obtained from the Pinball 2000 website at http://www.pinball2000.com.\n\nStarting from the outside of the machine:\n\n Auto-plunger\n\nSquare button which is pressed to plunge the ball into play. This is\nalso used for Martian Bombs (similar to Attack From Mars) which can\nbe used during Martian Attack mode by hitting the Auto-plunger to\nkill a martian with 1 bomb. There is no beginning-of-ball ball saver by\ndefault, however this can be adjusted.\n\n Action buttons\n\nThe regular sized left and right flipper buttons are mounted next to a\ncurved button which circles halfway around them. These buttons will\npresumably provide more interaction during play for future Pinball 2000\ngames. For this particular game, they are used to select which mode in the\nFuel or Weapons groups you wish to start at the beginning of the game\n(designated by a small arrow on the video display), and are also used\nduring various other modes (see below). These buttons can also cancel\ncertain displays (e.g. pressing both flipper and action buttons all at\nonce during a playing TV channel during Mars Kneads Women will skip the\nshow and return the ball).\n Speakers\n\nThese are located just under the \"backglass\" area of the machine in one\nlong horizontal panel and jut out a bit closer to the player than older\nmachines.\n\nThe inside of the machine:\n\n Video display \n\nA video image is projected onto the upper part of the playfield which\ndisplays information about the modes, various humorous graphics and other\nnecessary information for game play. This is the major change that makes\nPinball 2000 differ from its past and is a fairly impressive sight to see.\nThe image is \"interactive\" in that it responds when a target just behind\nit is hit so that it appears as though you are interacting with the video\nitself.\n\n Center Target bank \n\nThis is a small barrier of targets at the very center of the playfield\nwhich is hidden by the video image projected onto them. It is worthwhile\nto take a look at this when the video is not on to get a feeling for where\nthe ball would be going once this barrier is hit. Shooting the targets on\nthis barrier count as hits towards the running modes and also affect what\nis shown on the video display.\n\n Capture Lane \n\nThis is basically the lock and is located just to the right of the Center\nTarget Bank. Shooting the ball into the Capture lane will either 1. light\nCapture and feed it to the top left rollover lanes and jet bumpers or 2.\naward a Capture (lock the ball) and send a ball down the right ramp. There\nare 3 Captures and each Capture must first be lit before a ball can be\n\"locked\". Upon awarding the 3rd Capture, the regular multiball will start\n(see Multiballs below).\n\nLeft and Right Orbits\n\nThese are basically the outer loops on the playfield. Each loop has a red\narrow and circle associated with its entrance. When the arrow is lit or\nflashing, it signals that the shot needs to be hit. When the circle is\nlit, it means that the shot has already been done, but by shooting it\nagain you can gain missiles. This is also true for the left and right ramps\nas well (see next). Shooting the ball to the left loop will feed it to the\nRollover Lane and Jet Bumper area in the upper left corner. Shooting the\nball to the right loop will also feed the ball to the top left rollover\nlanes and jet bumpers.\n\n Ramps \n\nThere are two ramps, one on the right and left side, which feed the ball\nto their respective inlane (similar to Attack From Mars). Again, each ramp\nhas two corresponding red lights associated with--a red arrow and red\ncircle. When the arrow is lit or flashing, it signals that the shot needs\nto be hit. When the circle is lit, it means that the shot has already been\ndone, but by shooting it again you can gain missiles.\n\nMini ramp\n\nThis is located on the center of the playfield just below the Center\nTarget Bank and lays flat until the end of a mode is near. When the mode\nis about to be completed, this ramp will raise up. Shooting the ball\nacross the ramp will cause it to fly up and land on a mini platform just\nabove the Center Target Bank where it rolls to the left and rests as the\nvideo displays the mode completion sequence. Once this is done and a new\nmode starts, the ball is fed to the left into the a small capture zone\n(just below the jet bumpers) and subsequently down the left orbit. This\nmini ramp has a corresponding red light on the playfield which (when lit\nand the ramp is raised) signals the player to shoot the ball up the ramp.\n\nJet Bumpers\n\nThere are 3 of these in the upper left corner of the playfield, just below\nthe two rollover lanes.\n\nRollover Lanes\n\nThere are two of these in the upper left corner of the playfield that sit\nabove the jet bumpers. Rolling a ball through them will cause their\ncorresponding lights to light up. Hitting a flipper button will cause\nthese lights to switch from one to the other, making it possible to\nlight both and advance the Bonus Multiplier. The ball will always roll\ndown the left orbit after it has passed through the Rollover Lanes and\nJet Bumpers.\n \nThere are also four of these located at the entrance of both inlanes and\nboth outlanes. These work the same way as the ones from Attack From\nMars--the object being to use the flipper buttons to guide the ball down\nan unlit one to light it and eventually light all four to get Stroke of\nLuck lit.\n\n Stroke of Luck \n\nThis is a scoop located on the upper part of the playfield near the right\nside. There are three lights below it labelled \"Stroke of Luck\", \"Extra\nBall\" and \"Martian Attack\". The awards for shooting the ball into the\nscoop while one or more of these is lit are as follows:\n\nExtra Ball: extra ball\nMartian Attack: begins Martian Attack mode (see Modes)\nStroke of luck: random award (below is a list of possible awards)\n\n500,000 points\n1,000,000 points\nLight Martian Attack\n3 Missiles\nMartian Bomb\n1 Saucer Light\nHypno Multiball\nCapture Multiball\nLight Extra Ball\nLight Capture\nAward Capture\n+5 Bonus X\nHold Bonus X\n\n\n Saucer lights\n\nThere is a saucer painted on the playfield in the very center which has 9\nred lights. These red lights must all be lit up for Attack Mars\nto light. During play, the lights will blink successively in a pattern for\na moment, then flash several times the amount of lights you currently\nhave. There are many ways to get one or more of these lights and they\nare as follows:\n\nComplete a mode with a Flawless rating (1 saucer light)\nScore a Super Jackpot in regular multiball (1 saucer light)\nBonus Wave Multiballs (see table below)\nDestroy any 10 and 30 (adjustable by operator) martians in Martian\nMultiball (2 saucer lights)\nVia Stroke of Luck (1 saucer light)\n\n Martian targets \n\nThere are a total of 7 martian targets on the playfield. 3 on the left\nside underneath a rubber green martian (just like Attack From Mars!)\nand another 3 plus a martian on the right side, as well as 1 to the left\nof the Center Target Bank. Hitting all of these martian targets and\nlighting their respective lights on the playfield will light Martian\nAttack via the Stroke of Luck scoop.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nThere is a 10 second wait for a choice to be made until the game defaults\nto the group not selected during the last game (i.e. if you don't select\nmanually it will alternate the default group between fuel and weapons).\nDepending on which sets of modes the player finds easier or worth risking\nfor points, either of these two can work to one's advantage.\n\nOnce the ball is launched into play, it ends up in the rollover lanes\nwhere the lighted lane is worth 500,000 then an additional 100,000 points\nfor each subsequent skill shot. There is also a Super Skill Shot which is\nvery similar to Attack From Mars (and Medieval Madness) which can be done\nby holding down the left flipper button while launching the ball into\nplay. This will cause the ball to bypass the rollover lanes completely and\ncircle around the left orbit, coming into contact with the left flipper.\nFrom here, a shot to one of the orbits or ramps within 10(?) seconds will\naward a Super Skill Shot worth a base value of 1,000,000, adding 200,000\neach subsequent time. This also spots 3 missiles, which makes it more\nworthwhile to attempt the Super Skill Shot than to take the normal one.\nAlso note that when the Super Skill Shot is attempted, if the ball goes\nfrom the Capture Lane into the rollover/jets area, it will still award the\nregular skill shot if it's still lit.\n\nExtra Ball/Replay & Warnings\n\nAnother major difference between Revenge From Mars and previous\nnon-Pinball 2000 games, is the way extra balls and replays are handled.\nIt is possible to rack up a great many extra balls and keep your game\ngoing for a long, long time. The game defaults to giving out an extra ball\nat a certain score level rather than a replay. The default scores are at\n50M and 200M, and this, as well as the replay, can be adjusted. You can\nalso get extra balls by doing other things, such as\ncompleting Hypno Multiball, obtaining a certain amount of missiles,\ncollecting a certain amount of Bonus Wave items, etc. When an extra ball\nis given, the machine will sound its virtual knocker (similar to a regular\nreplay sound) and flash a rather dull but distracting animation across\nthe display. Match credits are also available at the end of the game. The\ngame also defaults to 1 tilt warning, but again this can be adjusted by\nthe operator.\n\nModes\n\nThere are 9 different main modes which can each be completed to obtain a\nSaucer\nlight. These 9 modes are divided into 3 different groups and\nare listed below. The initial mode begins upon its selection\nat the start of the game (either manually with the action buttons or\nautomatically after the choice times out). The modes move\nfrom left to right in sequence automatically after the previous mode has\nbeen completed (i.e. there is no \"start mode\" shot), with the exception of\nthe middle group (Saucer) which begins after the other two mode groups\nhave been completed. Each individual mode continues\nuntil it has been completed, even between balls. When a mode has been\ncompleted, the video will display a report. If the mode is completed\nproperly according to\nthe directions on the video display, the player will receive a\n\"Flawless\" rating. This rating must be achieved in order to obtain\none Saucer light. Thus completing all of these modes with a\nFlawless rating will complete the Saucer lights requirement\nneccessary. This, along with the other 2 requirements (stated in the\nBackground/Objective), will light Attack Mars. Remember that\nSaucer lights can also be obtained in other ways, so getting\nFlawless on all (or even any) of these modes is not a requirement.\n\nFuel\n\nAlien Abduction  The scene is in front of the White House.\nA large saucer is hovering overhead, with smaller saucers appearing to the\nsides. Various objects (sportscars, cows, etc) appear at the sides as\nwell, and the smaller UFOs attempt to use their tractor beams to steal\nthese objects (these objects can be cycled through by using the Action\nbuttons). The scoring is based on saving the item being beamed up and goes\nup to 3 million. Regardless of where an item's value starts, it counts\ndown fairly rapidly (i.e. a hurry-up) once the martians start abducting\nit. Shooting the martian to save the item immediately awards the current\nitem's value, and adds the item value to the mode \"jackpot\" (which starts\nat 1M). Once all items have been rescued and the center ramp lights, the\nmode jackpot will start counting down as a hurry-up until you shoot the\nramp to collect. Hitting the center targets, ramps and\nloops will destroy the smaller UFOs, as will the missiles. After seven\nof the smaller saucers are destroyed, one final hit up the middle Mini\nramp will destroy the large saucer, ending the mode. Destroying all seven\nsaucers will award a Flawless rating and a Saucer light.\n\n\nMartian Happy Hour\nFive martians walk into a bar...  Oh, never mind.  In this\nwell-done mode, there are five martians sitting at the bar in various\nstates of inebriation, cracking bad human jokes, consuming various\nflammable substances and engaging in dangerous pasttimes.  Overhead are\nsuspended three \"kegs\" of kerosene, gasoline and propane, which can be set\noff by the Missiles with devastating effects. The martians on each of the\nramps can be destroyed by one hit apiece, the ones on the Capture Lane and\nmartian target (left of the Center Target bank) take two hits apiece, and\nthe one in the middle takes three hits (these hit numbers can be adjusted\nby the difficulty setting). Each martian destroyed\nawards 1.5M points. Each orbit will set off one of the kegs on the\nsides for 4M apiece. To destroy the center keg, one must shoot the\nright ramp (after taking care of the martian that's blocking the way)\nand the center ramp will briefly pop up. If you successfully make this\nshot, it is worth 6M points. (Note: destroying all three kegs will\nimmediately blow up the bar, ending the mode and possibly denying you of a\nFlawless rating unless you've already killed all the martians). When the\nthree center martians are destroyed, the center ramp will pop up to end\nthe mode, awarding 2M for any remaining kegs at the top of the screen.\nDestroying all five martians will award a Flawless rating and Saucer\nLight.\n\n\nSecret Weapon\n\nHaving\ngotten a clue finally, the Martians turn the Big-O-Beam on themselves,\ncreating a giant Martian.  In response, Mankind has the ABE (Advanced\nBattle Emancipator) to fight back with. This mode is depicted as\nhand-to-hand combat between the ABE and one of the Big-O-Martians.  a\n\"life bar\" is shown at the top for the martian, and various shots\nwill cut down this life bar (Didn't they already try this one in\nChampion Pub?). Finally, when the life bar is down all the way, in a\ncallback to the Mortal Kombat games, \"Finish him!\" appears on the\nscreen, and one last shot will send the martian flying upwards and\nhitting the saucer, causing it to explode dramatically.  This is one\nof the easier modes to get a Flawless rating in.\n\n\nSaucer\n\nTower Struggle\n\nThe leaning tower of pisa is being used for a game of Tug-of-War by four\nmartians. Shoot the left and right ramps to destroy the saucers with\none hit apiece, and the two martians that are located on the lock shot\nand the top martian light. As in several other modes, there is a \"life\nbar\" which is decreased by shooting the tower (Center Target Bank), and\nenough hits will eventually raise the ramp to end the mode. Destroying the\ntwo martians and saucers will immediately raise the center Mini ramp to\nend the mode with one more shot. All four must be destroyed for a Flawless\nrating.\n\n\nMystery Mode (?)\n\nThis mode will randomly select from several different things listed below\n(note: these are all great modes that should probably be seen first\nrather than reading it here--so skip this part unless you want the\nspoiler).  \n\nMartian Aerobics:\n\nThis is a tribute to Space Invaders. By shooting any shot, you will shoot\nsome missiles at the 24 moving martians on the screen. Since they are\nmoving, you have to shoot missiles that will have a chance of hitting them.\nSometimes while playing this mode, a huge saucer floats down into the\nmiddle of the image. You can shoot it, but it is unclear yet whether or\nnot you can destroy it without completing the mode the usual way. Destroy\nall 24 before they get to the bottom of the screen to finish the\nmode and receive your saucer light.\n\n\n\nMartian Bowling:\n\n The name pretty much sums it up (it's better to see this than describe it).\nUse the Action buttons to make your aim.\n\n\n\nMartian Autopsy:\n\n As the title suggests, you are placed in the middle of a martian autopsy\ntaking place. At the start of the mode, a hurry-up runs on the center\nshot, starting at 3M. Whatever value you collect is locked in as the\nvalue for each object during the rest of the mode. Your job is to collect\n10 objects for a Flawless rating (and Saucer Light). Just try not to be\ngrossed out too much.\n\n\n\nMartian Tank:\n\nThis mode is pretty tough to complete. Basically there is a moving tank\ntarget with two martians sitting aboard on both sides. The object is to\ndestroy both martians. Doing this will get you a Flawless rating. Good\nluck.\n\n\nDrive-In Demolition\n\nThis mode pays homage to \"Move Your Car\" from Creature From The Black\nLagoon, but this time, it's the martians blocking the screen. Fortunately,\nyou just happen to drive some pretty heavy weaponry here, and have plenty\nof opportunity to kick some martian butt. As with Secret Weapon, all shots\nwill inflict damage (there is a power bar that tells you how much damage\nyou still have left to do). In order to get your saucer light you must\ncomplete the meter all the way down. Beyond that, I'll avoid ruining this\none--see it for yourself.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nParis in Peril\n\nThis mode begins with a flying saucer located over the Eiffel Tower.\nThere is a catapult in the center which is used to fire various objects\n(Watermelons, spiked balls, cows, ?) at the saucer. Hitting the\ncenter targets will fire the catapult, with each hit doing 13% damage\n(this is operator adjustable and can be up to 25% or 4 hits to destroy).\nThe missile lanes on the outside will do 25% damage to the\nsaucer. After the saucer is hit once, 4 martians will parachute in (some\nmay not be initially visible as they float off of the screen) on the left\nand right ramps, the Capture lane and the martian target to the left of\nthe Center Target Bank. Each martian can be destroyed by one hit from the\nball, and are worth 1M, 1.5M, 2M, and 5M. All 4 must be destroyed for a\nFlawless rating. You can complete this mode with or without destroying the\nmartians by hitting the middle X times (the side shots do 2x the middle\ndamage). After 8 hits of damage (again, operator adjustable), the center\nMini Ramp will pop up, and one more shot will destroy the saucer (with a\nrather nice explosion effect), ending the mode and awarding some points\n(as yet undetermined). Unfortunately, the new and improved technology\ndoesn't seem to do much to help the insults in this mode.\n\n\nBig-O-Beam\n\nThis mode is set on a farm, where the livestock seem to have taken on\nrather large proportions. There is a saucer hovering over the barn, and\nlarge barnyard animals to the side. Hitting the center targets will cause\nthe barn to leap up and damage the saucer (makes a lot of sense, huh?)\nfor 2M points per hit. The ramps and orbits will, in addition to awarding\nmissiles, shrink the currently enlarged animals for 4M apiece. There are 4\nanimals (a\ncow, a duck, a pig and a chicken) which need to be \"saved\" for a Flawless\nrating. There is \"Life bar\" above the saucer that shows how much\ndamage is left--once this is depleted the center mini ramp will raise and\nlight. Shrinking all 4 animals will also cause the center ramp to\nraise and light to finish the mode, so you don't have to deplete the life\nbar. Overall, this mode is a good one to start out the game on, as this\none is a higher-point mode than several others.\n\n\nMars Kneads Women\n\nThere are six television screens you can tune in on. You can change the\ncurrently playing show on these by using the Action Buttons. The object\nhere is to tune into a screen and watch the show (some nice-looking\ncartoon animation was done for this mode, and some of the quotes are\nquite funny as well). You can always cancel a show by pressing all 4\nbuttons while it is playing (now why would you want to do that?!). The\nleft TV screens can be viewed by\neither hitting the loop or the left ramp/middle ramp combo. Same goes for\nthe right side. If you shoot either the left or right ramp, the center\nramp will pop up for a shot to watch a show. Shooting the orbits is a\nbetter way to go, as this will start the show immediately and save you a\nshot (the rollover lanes will register here, but the jets are disabled,\nand the ball isn't returned to play until the show is over or\ncancelled). The center targets will light the 2 center TV screens (which,\nagain, can be watched via the center ramp shot). Finally, after the two\ncenter TV screens have been watched, one more center ramp shot will\ndestroy the console for a point value between 2-5M based on how many\nTVs were watched during the mode. Note, the screen will say \"Destroy\nthe Console\" to let you know that the ramp shot will end the mode, so if\nyou are not finished viewing all of the screens, shoot the remaining\nshot(s), watch the shows, then destroy the console to get Flawless.\nYou must view all six TV stations to obtain a Flawless rating.\n\n\nother modes and related things\n\nMissiles\n\nDuring modes, shooting either the outer loop on either side or the ramps\nwill award missiles, and will have positive effects on the current mode.\nBy default, once 20 missiles have been collected (and also at 50), extra\nball will light via the Stroke of Luck scoop. At 30 missiles, 5M points\nwill be awarded. Alternatively, missiles may\nbe spotted as a Stroke of Luck award, and by the Super Skill Shot (see\nabove). On any given ball, the first missile\nwill be 500K, and subsequent missiles collected will be an additional 100K\n(e.g. second missile 600K, etc.)  This value is reset back to 500K at the\nbeginning of the next ball. On a ball that has been in play for some time,\nmissile shots can become an excellent source of points.\n\nMartian Attack\n\nThis works in the same way that it does in Attack From Mars, except only 2\nrubber martians wiggle around and must be killed. Once this is done, the\ncenter Mini Ramp will raise up and its corresponding light will flash\nsignaling to hit the ball across it and kill the giant martian on the\nvideo display. When the giant martian is killed successfully, Martian\nMultiball will begin (see Multiballs). Again, just like in Attack From\nMars, the initial three martians can be killed off with Martian Bombs.\n\nAttack Mars\n\nBeware, a spoiler follows!  Skip to Multiballs if you don't want\nto read this. If you want to be prepared but not spoiled,\nremember: use the Action buttons to aim/line up your targets.\nThis is where your 300 Mil game becomes your 600 Mil game. The only\ncatch is that you have to use the Action buttons while you are hitting\nballs, which can be extremely difficult if you are not paying\nattention! The center shot\nmust be hit to start Attack Mars. There are 3 steps (kinda like Cirqus\nVoltaire except the balls don't drain after each one): 1) Destroy three\nships with radar. You have to use the action buttons to move the ship to\nthe center of the screen, then shoot the middle shot to blow it up.\nAlthough it is difficult the first time you do it, it isn't that hard. 2)\nDestroy four weird looking things (I don't quite know what to call\nthem) by shooting the main shots of the game and also using the Action\nbuttons to control their destination. 3) Destroy the Big Brain\nmartian by shooting the middle shot and then the middle ramp when it is\nraised. Once completed you get easily over 100 Mil just for the end shot.\n\nMultiballs\n\nMartian Multiball\n\nThis multiball begins once Martian Attack mode is completed. It's a two\nball multiball where every shot destroys a martian for 1M points apiece.\nOn the display, it will let you know how many martians you have killed and\nhow many you must kill. You will start out with 3 martians killed since it\ncounts the first 3 you needed to get to multiball. Destroying any 10\n(again, operator adjustable) martians in total awards 1 Saucer Light.\nThere is also a second limit point (30?) where another Saucer Light can be\nawarded. Shoot the middle shot twice, then that will raise the middle ramp\nand if you hit that twice you blow up the middle big martian (worth 2M\npoints) and another one will take its place. This multiball is mutually\nexclusive from Regular multiball (unlike in Attack From Mars) and\ninterrupts the mode in progress.\n\nRegular multiball\n\nThis begins after being awarded the 3rd Capture (or a Stroke of Luck\naward). In this 3-ball multiball, the object is to shoot down 10\nsaucers (located on all the major upper playfield targets) which will\naward points based on where they're located (the center targets are 500k,\nthe Capture lane and martian target are 1M, and the ramps are 1.5M) and\nwill also increase the super jackpot. After 10 saucers are destroyed, a\nbigger saucer will appear near the middle. Once this is hit 5 times, Super\nJackpot is awarded (as well as 1 Saucer Light). After this is completed,\nthe little ships will appear again to repeat the process (the only\ndifference is that you cannot get another Saucer Light). If you drain all\nbut one ball while the larger ship is there waiting for its 5 hits, it\nwill remain in the Multiball mode until you have completed the hits and\ngotten Super Jackpot or until the ball drains. This multiball is also\nmutually exclusive from Martian Multiball (unlike in Attack From Mars) and\ninterrupts the mode in progress.\n\nBonus Wave Multiballs (Fuel, Saucer & Weapons)\n\nThese multiballs begin after completing either the Fuel, Saucer or Weapons\nmode groups and are functionally identical. These modes are 4-ball\nmultiballs where the goal is to collect weapons and/or fuel.\nThe different shots are worth different point: center is 100K+100K, lock\nlane is 250K+250K, and the ramps/orbits are 500K+500K. At the start of the\nmultiball, there will be a \"2X\" floating on a shot.  You can move this\nmultiplier with the action buttons. If you shoot it, it doubles the value\nof whatever shot you just made (also counts for double items), and also\nprevents you from moving the \"2X\" back to that shot. If you successfully\nshoot the \"2X\" on all four shots (center, both ramps, lock), it\nturns to a 3X, and all shots are available again for the multiplier.  You\ncan get this multiplier up to a maximum of 5X. The awards for collecting\nitems are listed below in the table for the latest ROM revision (1.4). The\nfirst award is given at a default of 5 items collected, but this can be\nadjusted by the operator. If the starting award is adjusted to 4, then the\nremainder of the awards are given out in intervals of 4 (4, 8, 12...).\n\n\n           Revision 1.4:\n# Items\n   5          JP\n  10          JP\n  15          SL\n  20          JP\n  25          JP\n  30          EB\n  35          JP\n  40   Mothership Multiball\nJP=Jackpot\nSL=Saucer light\nEB=Extra Ball\n\n\nWhen all but the last ball has drained, the center ramp will raise for\n\"Sudden Death.\"  A final shot on the center ramp will award a bonus of\n100K per item collected during the multiball round and show a total score\nfor the round. The items collected in Bonus Wave Multiballs are\ncumulative, meaning you don't need to collect all 40 items in a single\nmultiball.\n\nMothership Multiball\n\nWhen the appropriate number of items in Bonus Wave Multiballs are\ncollected (40 medium setting, 50 hard setting), the flippers will be\ndisabled, allowing all balls to drain, at the start of Mothership\nMultiball. As implied, the goal is to destroy the Martian mothership.\nAll shots will damage the saucer (the ramps and orbits more so\nthan the center targets) until the center ramp pops up for a final\nshot to destroy the mothership for big points.\nOf course, the martians aren't done with you yet. Destroy the mothership\nand you'll next face the (groan) Grand Mothership, and so on, until all\nbut one ball is drained. When you're down to one ball, the center\nramp will pop up to shoot and destroy the current mothership.\nWhen you shoot this ramp, the round will end, and you will\nproceed back into the regular mode.\n\nHypno Multiball\n\nThis will show up as a Stroke of Luck award, usually after about 2-3\nStroke of Luck awards have been collected or several modes have been\ncompleted. Think strobe multiball without the flashing. All playfield\nlights go\nout except for those relating to a lit shot. Corresponding to the lit\nshot, a giant rotating spiral with 3 smaller rotating spirals are shown\nlocated at both ramps and the Capture Lane via the heads up display.\nThe center targets will \"damage\" the large spiral, the \"Beam Integrity\"\n(percentage) of which is shown on the display. You must lower the Beam\nIntegrity down to 0% to destroy the large spiral (about 15 hits).\nHitting a smaller spiral will add a ball, relaunch any lost balls, and\nalso awards a brief (10 second) ball saver. When the Beam Integrity on\nthe large spiral has been depleted, the ramp will pop up to defeat it. The\nfirst time this is completed, an extra ball will be awarded. The second\ntime, it is worth 15M.\n\nCows, Easter eggs & misc.\n\nThere is a plane on the backglass that says \"P2K\" and \"Gomez\" on the\nside.\n\nThe extra ball animation that was to be the Pinball 2000 version of an\nAttack From Mars martian getting bonked upside the head (see Scott\nSlomiany's web site)\nhas been removed and replaced with a dull \"Extra Ball\" text screen.  Scott\nhimself has said that the animation is/will be the first Pinball 2000\nentry in the Lost Temple of DOHO.\n\nCows:\n\n On the backglass, the giant martian is holding a cow in one of its claws.\n During the Big-O-Beam mode, one of the giant farm animals is a cow.\n In Paris in Peril, occasionally the catapult on the center targets will\nfling a cow at the saucer.\n In Alien Abduction, a cow gets.. well, abducted by aliens.\n In the Intro to Capture (regular) Multiball, as the saucer flies by\nSaturn, if you look very quickly, they managed to hide a cow in the\nplanet's ring (left side). You have to look quickly, since the cow only\nshows up for one frame.\n\n\nCorn sightings:\n\n The woman on the backglass is carrying a bag of corn.\n In the \"Julia Child\" scene in \"Mars Kneads Women\" there is corn.\n In another scene from \"Mars Kneads Women\" where a woman is being chased\nacross the screen by two Martians, there is a poster in a shop window in\nthe background that says \"Sale: corn on the cob\"\n It also shows up during the final Attack Mars stage, although I won't\nspoil this one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Revenge From Mars", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/revengefrommars.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Revenge From Mars", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "Revenge From Mars Rule Sheet\n_________________________________________________________________\nBy: Josh Sharpe\n\n                           Important Stuff\n\nThis section describes each mode going from left to right on the\nplayfield\n\nALIEN ABDUCTION\n     Hit both ramps or loops to destroy the ship and save whatever\n     object they are taking. There are 6 in total and if you can\n     collect all six you earn your saucer light. To finish mode,\n     like all others shoot the middle to collect the countdown\n     value.\n\nMARTIAN HAPPY HOUR\n     There are five martians you need to kill. The left and right\n     ramp are two. You must hit the lock shot twice to get the\n     third, and the middle shot along with the martian target next\n     to the middle shot are the last two. At any time after the\n     middle ramp goes up you can end the mode, but this an easy\n     saucer light to get.\n\nSECRET WEAPON\n   You automatically get a saucer light if you defeat this mode.\n   Every shot adds to the hit damage Robo-Lincoln does on the\n   alien. Beat on him until his bar goes down and shoot the middle\n   shot to \"Finish Him\" (ala Mortal Kombat).\n\nTOWER STRUGGLE\n   The leaning tower of Pisa is being held by four martians. Shoot\n   the left and right ramps to get two of them. The other two are\n   the lock shot and the top martian light. After that you can\n   shoot up the middle ramp and receive your saucer light. This\n   mode can also be completed by shooting the center shot right at\n   the tower (same as AFM). I don't recommend it and you don't get\n   a saucer light.\n\n\"?\"\n   I can only explain Martian aerobics because it's the only one\n   programmed right now. Shoot any shot and you will shoot a\n   missile at the martians on the screen. The martians are lined up\n   like Galaga and each missile usually takes out two or three\n   depending on where you hit them. Destroy all 32 before they\n   escape to receive your saucer light.\n\nDRIVE IN DEMOLITION\n   There is a power bar that tells you how much damage you still\n   have left to do. Every shot adds to the damage and at a certain\n   point you can shoot the middle ramp and a huge bomb will drop\n   down and destroy everything. In order to get your saucer light\n   you must complete the meter all the way down\n\nPARIS IN PERIL\n   You can either take out the four martians or just hit the tower\n   directly. Again both ramps, the lock shot, and the top martian\n   target are the martian shots\n\nBIG-O-BEAM\n  There are four animals that you need to destroy. On the left is\n  chicken and a cow and on the right is a pig and a duck. Hit\n  either the loop or ramp on either side to destroy one. Once all\n  four are destroyed the mode is completed\n\nMARTIANS KNEAD WOMEN\n  There are six television stations you can tune in on. The left\n  ones can be viewed by either hitting the loop or the left\n  ramp/middle ramp combo. Same goes for the right side. To view\n  the middle screens shoot the middle shot and then the ramp will\n  pop up. View either just the two in the middle or all six to\n  raise the ramp and destroy the tv.\n\nBONUS WAVE MULTIBALLS\n  After each set of three is complete you get Bonus Wave Multi\n  ball. During this the goal is to eventually get to Mothership\n  Multiball. Each shot is a jackpot (some times two, etc.). At a\n  certain number (20) you receive an extra ball. And you also\n  get big Jackpots along the way once you get 40 jackpots you get\n  Mothership Multiball. If you do not get 40 on your first BWM\n  you start up your next one from the number of jackpots you left\n  off at.\n\nMOTHERSHIP MULTIBALL\n  Shoot everything, but mainly the loops and ramps to shoot at\n  the Mothership. After enough power has been taken off you\n  destroy the ship by shooting the middle shot. Then a new ship\n  will come out.\n\nATTACK MARS\n  This is where your 300 Mil game become your 600 Mil game. You\n  must get all the saucer lights (9 of them) and complete all the\n  modes. Once you do there is a middle shot you must hit to start\n  to Attack Mars. There are 3 steps (kinda like Cirqus Voltaire\n  except the balls don't drain after each one): 1) Destroy three\n  ships with radar. You have to use the action buttons to move\n  the ship to the center of the screen, then shoot the middle\n  shot to blow it up. Although it is difficult the first time you\n  do it, it isn't that hard. 2) Destroy four weird looking things\n  (I don't quite know what to call them) by shooting the main\n  shots of the game. 3) Destroy the Big Brain martian by shooting\n  the middle shot and then the middle ramp when it is raised.\n  Once completed you get easily over 100 Mil just for the end\n  shot.\n\nREGULAR MULTIBALL\n  Shoot and lock your balls and once you lock three you get your\n  MB. all shots except for the loops destroy ships. Destroy 10\n  and a bigger ship will come out. Hit it five times as it moves\n  across the screen to get your super jackpot. Repeat.\n\nMARTIAN MULTIBALL\n  To start it hit both side shots and then the raised ramp up the\n  middle. It's a two ball multiball where every shot destroys a\n  martian. Shoot the middle shot twice, then that will raise the\n  middle ramp and if you hit that twice you blow up the middle\n  big martian.\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Revenge From Mars", "possible_shots": "Both ramps, loops, lock shot, middle shot, martian target next to the middle shot, top martian light, any shot", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/revengefrommars.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

Earl\n\n<2> Description & Design Team \nRiverboat Gambler was released by Williams in August of 1990, as game # 50007. It was released around the same time as Funhouse, but with a much smaller production run. Also, Funhouse runs on the WPC-A system (TM:BOP), where RG is a System 11-C (Rollergames). In fact, Riverboat Gambler was the last 11-C game released. It has been estimated that there are, perhaps, 300 remaining in the U.S., as a great many were shipped overseas. The machine is set up with three pinballs installed. One of the balls is essentially a spare, since multiball is a two-ball affair here.\nThe final ROM revision is L-3. According to Dwight Sullivan, there are no H-ROM's. However, during the introduction of Riverboat Gambler at AMOA Expo (October 25-27, 1990) in New Orleans, there was a slight modification made. If 777 777 777 came up on the Slot Machine during the show, the display would say *T-Shirt* instead of *Special*. The person playing the game would then receive a Riverboat Gambler T-shirt. Other games at this show: Simpsons, Dr. Dude, and Whirlwind.\nThe shirt is red, and the total design area is 6 1/2 inches tall by 11 1/4 wide.\nWhile not common, you can find some RG's with Diamond Plate playfields. The flyer shows the partially obscured words\nOTECTED BYPLATE\njust above the left flipper, so we know that at least some were released that way.\nRG is a game really designed with the street location (read: Bar) in mind. A classic gambling theme, pin-up style backglass, standard width, and simple playfield layout. Due to the random nature of the jackpots , it is not a machine for purists. However, for sheer fun, and aesthetics, it is an excellent machine, well suited to home use.\nThe design team is as follows (from Uncle Willy):\n\nDesign: Ward Pemberton\nSoftware: Dwight Sullivan (his first pinball programming credit)\nMusic/Sounds: Dan Forden, Paul Heitsch\nArt: Pat McMahon\n\nNote that if you find a game without the design credits listed on the playfield, then it's a prototype.\nThere is a great bit of trivia on an uncredited vocal appearance.\nAlso mentioned on the playfield design credits:\n\nLinda Deal (Theatre of Magic backglass artist)\nGreg Tastad\n\n<3> Cabinet/Backglass unique features \nThese features mostly relate to the Roulette feature of the game.\nThe Lockdown Bar\nThe lockdown bar features four rectangular buttons. Left to right they are:\nRed-White(pass)-Green-Black\nThese are used to place your bet on the Roulette wheel. The Pass button is just that. You pass your bet, and pinball play continues.\nThe Roulette Wheel\nIn the head of the machine, dead center of the backglass, there is a vertical roulette wheel, five inches across. Well, it's more like a wheel of fortune at a carnival, since it doesn't actually use a ball. The wheel in Tee'd Off is actually a truer *roulette* wheel. But I digress...\nThe wheel is divided into 16 sections. 7 are black, 7 are red, and 2 are green. The colors alternate like a standard Roulette wheel. The two green sections also have stars. There are two other stars, one on black, and one on red. If the wheel is lined up correctly, the stars sit at North, South, East, West (if the wheel were a compass...).\nOn the flyer for RG, all the non-starred roulette spaces are numbered. The flyer shows the wheel stopped on the red star space. going clockwise the numbers/colors are: StarR, 12B, 5R, 2B, StarG, 3R, 8B, 11R, StarB, 10R, 7B, 4R, StarG, 1B, 6R, 9B. This wheel was mocked up specifically for the photo shoot. At the time, there was some thought that the numbers would have an impact on the game play/scoring. That idea was abandoned as making the rules too complicated.\nWin Meter\nA vertical series of 7 lights. You advance the meter by either winning Casino Games, or shooting the Winning Streak loop,or spelling CASINO. When the Win Meter reaches the top, Roulette is lit for JACKPOT. You can advance the Win Meter to the top directly by correctly selecting GREEN on the roulette wheel. Depending on operator setting, the meter starts at 1,2,3, or 4 lights lit.\nAlso depending on operator settings, the meter may drop down a notch if you don't win anything in a set period of time. This can range from 10 through 30 seconds, or it can be turned off. If the drop feature is on, it will be (temporarily) stopped by any of the following: bumpers, ramp, FIVE CARD targets, Blackjack standup, or CHIPS standup. If the Win Meter is at the top, it will stay there until you lose the Jackpot, or drain the ball after winning Jackpot.\nBackglass Displays\nAs with most modern era pins, the backglass (translite) sits above the scoring display. Well, RG has two additional displays in the backglass. The first is :\nCHIPS\nLocated directly above the roulette wheel, this is a four digit display that keeps track of your *chips*. Chips are earned on the playfield, and used to bet on the roulette wheel.\n(Tech note: It's actually a 7 digit display, but the first three are masked by the backglass). Chips are also used for end-of-ball bonus. They are worth 1,000 points each.\nBreak The Bank\nLocated in the upper right corner (think Taxi's jackpot meter), this keeps track of the number of points that can be obtained by winning the Roulette Jackpot. A seven digit display, it maxes out at 9,999,000\n<4> Playfield Layout \nStarting at the right outlane, and working clockwise:\nA note on lanes: there is lane change. It is bi-directional. Hit the left flipper, the lit lane moves left, hit the right, it moves right. Unlike many games, you are *not* trying to light all the lanes. There is one light, period.\nRight Outlane: Standard, with post separating it from inlane. When lit with lane change feature, it scores 50 chips and 50,000 points. Otherwise, 25,000 pts, no chips. Note: When ball drains down either outlane, the female voice on the machine says a very sincere\n*Too Bad*.\nRight Return Lane: Again, standard. When lit, it scores 10,000, and lowers the Slot Machine Ramp. The timer on the ramp is operator adjustable, and ranges from 5 to 10 seconds. When the lane is not lit, it scores 5,000.\nFlippers: Two, standard. In addition to operating the lane change, they also activate the Status Report. Hold in either flipper, and the Status Report gives the following:\n\nReplay value\n# of stacked Second Chances\nBall in play\n# chips that will be awarded for next Blackjack\n# chips needed to open Roulette table. If table is open, it will say *PLAY ROULETTE*\n# of consecutive ramps needed to lower slot ramp\nHigh Rollers (4 high scores)\n\nThe Status Report will either cycle on its own, or you can advance through it by pressing on the other flipper.\nSlingshots: Two, standard. They toggle the value of *Royal Flush* between 100 and 200 chips.\nLeft Return Lane: Standard style. When lit, it scores 20,000 , and lights the right ramp for *Spot A Card*. Again, the timer is adjustable, and lasts from 5 to 10 seconds. When not lit, it scores 10,000.\nLeft Outlane: Same as right outlane.\nF-I-V-E Drop Target Bank: Located on the left of the playfield, with the *E* about halfway up, a bank of four drop targets. They are used for earning ROYAL FLUSH. Drop them all, they pop back up. Each target scores 10,000. Completing the bank scores 85,000, 10 chips, and spots a Royal Flush card.\nBlackjack Table: Top left corner of the playfield, a single standup target at the end of a *chute*. Completing Blackjack awards the *A* in CASINO, and advances the Win Meter. Next to this shot, on the right is the:\nBust Card: A single standup target that lights after the second hit of the Blackjack. Hit it when lit, and Blackjack resets. It scores 20,000 when lit, 5,000 otherwise. The Bust Card sits between the Blackjack Table and the:\nSlot Machine/Winning Streak/Roulette shot:\nThis a raise/lower ramp, like the lock ramp in HSII: The Getaway. If the ramp in HSII is at the 12:00 position, then rotate it 90 degrees to the 9:00 position. You now have a good idea of the positioning of this ramp.\nWhen the ramp is down, it feeds the Slot Machine. The ramp may be lowered one of two ways:\n\n1. Rolling over the lit Right Return Lane\n2. Hitting consecutive Winning Streak loop shots.\n\nNote: A half-hearted shot up the Slot Ramp will most likely result in a Straight_Down_The_Middle drain. This is rare, as it is a fairly short, shallow ramp.\nWhen the ramp is up, the shot leads to a permanent ramp that feeds the Roulette area directly over the plunger lane, and back to the right flipper. For purposes of this rulesheet, this is called the Winning Streak shot, always. If Roulette is lit, the ball is stopped, and you play Roulette. If not, the ball feeds directly back to the right return lane, *after* the rollover. During Multiball, this is the Winning Streak shot that advances the Win Meter. An unlit shot is worth 20,110 points (yes it's weird). A lit Winning Streak shot during Multiball is worth 100,000. If the shot is too soft to make it up the ramp, the ball diverts to the:\nBumpers: Three bumpers, standard triangle formation. When not flashing, they score 100 points, and award 1 chip per hit. When flashing (as determined by Skill Shot), they score 1,000 and award three chips. The bumpers also have what is euphemistically referred to in the manual as *Colorful Speech*. Translation: some woman going *Ooh*, *Ahh,* Yeah*. This speech can be normal, less frequent, or off entirely. (Ad 48) Directly below the bumpers is the:\nC-A-R-D Drop Target bank: Same as the F-I-V-E bank, except located about center playfield, angled to face toward the left out/return lane. Slightly above and to the right of the C-A-R-D bank is the:\nRight Ramp: This permanent ramp goes up, turns left across the top of the bumpers, crosses in front of the slot/bust/roulette area, comes behind the F-I-V-E targets, and returns the ball to the left flipper, after the rollover. This is potentially lucrative loop shot. The ramp is used in Five Card/Royal Flush. Just below the ramp entrance, to the right are the:\nCHIPS standups. They begin unlit. Lighting each scores 8,000 points, and awards a chip. After that, they score 3000 points. This brings us around to the :\nPlunger: A standard, manual plunger. There is a VERY important skill shot on Riverboat Gambler.\nA made skill shot delivers the ball (eventually) to the right flipper. If the shot is too hard, it feeds the bumpers, too soft and it rolls partially back down the plunger lane, exiting onto the playfield below the *S* standup in CHIPS.\nFinal note on the playfield: Between the plunger lane and the top of the right outlane, there is a gap large enough for the ball to get through. Some operators close this off with a rubber stretched between the two posts. This is not correct. The manual states that a small rubber should be placed on each of the posts, similar to the posts between the return lane & outlane. Some may leave the rubber off entirely, making for a fairly wide opening. Should the ball find its way through this opening, you get another chance at a skill shot!\nIf the ball finds its way through during Multiball, you get to play Single Ball Multiball until the second ball drains. This can be relatively lucrative.\n<5> CASINO Game Rules \nWhile Riverboat Gambler has no modes, it does have a series of six tasks. Each task awards points, chips, etc., and spots a letter in CASINO. Completing CASINO advances the win meter one extra notch, awards 2,000,000 points, some neat music plays, and the female voice says *Yeah....CASINO!* After completion, you can start over again.\nTo keep things simple, I'll describe each game, and then at the end of each section, list the operator-adjustable variables.\n*C* Five Card:\nThis game involves the F-I-V-E and C-A-R-D drop target banks, the right ramp, the left return lane, and the slingshots. There are five cards on the playfield that you are trying to light. It is a Royal Flush, in Hearts. You start with the *10*, and work up to *Ace*.\nYou start with between 0 and 3 cards. Cards are spotted in any of the following fashions:\n\n1. Completing either drop target bank\n2. Rolling over the *Spot Card* right return lane, and shooting the right ramp\n3. Looping the right ramp while it is lit to *Spot Card*\n\nThere are two lights visible through the ramp. One is white, and says *Hold Card*. The other is red and says *Spot Card*. When a card is spotted, it flashes. If you drain, any flashing cards are lost. If you hold a card, it is lit solidly, and will remain on the next ball.\nStarting with no cards, and no lights on the ramp, progression would go like this for looped ramp shots:\n\n1. *Shoot Ramp Again*\n2. *Spotted A Ten*\n3. *Ten Held*\n4. *Spotted A Jack*\n5. *Jack Held*\n\nLather, rinse, repeat on through <BUG>*Spotted A Ace*. (Yes it should say *An* ace, but it doesn't.) The machine will hold all cards before spotting another; e.g.-You use the ramp to spot a (flashing) jack. *Hold* is now lit. You complete the C-A-R-D bank. Now you have a flashing Jack and Queen. The next two ramp shots will hold those cards before spotting the King.\nIf you have all cards blinking (i.e.-ROYAL FLUSH is lit), completing F-I-V-E or C-A-R-D will hold the lowest flashing card.\nOnce all cards are lit, the right ramp is lit for ROYAL FLUSH, as indicated by a BIG white arrow in front of the ramp, similar in size to Gilligan's Island (another Pemberton design) KONA arrow-light. Shooting ROYAL FLUSH scores either 100 or 200 chips (toggled by the slingshots), awards the *C* in CASINO, scores 500,000 points, and advances the Win Meter. Royal Flush may collected multiple times via looping, and can be a VERY lucrative award.\n<BUG>: There is a very player-friendly bug here. If you collect ROYAL FLUSH, and the ball drains before the feature times out, ROYAL FLUSH will be lit on the next ball, UNLESS the next ball is a SECOND CHANCE.\nStrategy: If you save this for the last letter in CASINO, you can really help yourself. Shoot the ramp when lit for ROYAL FLUSH, you get the ROYAL FLUSH award, the *C*, spell CASINO, and get 2 million points. Loop the ramp a second time, and you are awarded the C to begin your next attempt at spelling CASINO. Much easier than starting from scratch\nOperator Adjustments:\n\n1. 5 Card Free Card: Begin with 0-3 cards (Ad 34)\n2. 2nd Five Card Timer: Royal Flush times out between 5-10 seconds\n(Ad35)\n3. Spot Card Timer (Ramp): *Spot Card* remains lit between 10-20\nseconds for looped ramp shots (Ad36)\n4. Spot Card Timer (Lane): *Spot Card* remains lit between 5-10\nseconds after rolling over left return lane (Ad37)\n5. Hold Card Memory: After a drain, held cards come back as either\nheld (solidly lit), or spotted (flashing). (Ad44)\n\n*A* Blackjack\nThis involves the single Blackjack Standup, and the Bust Card. Each hit of the Blackjack Standup *deals* a seven, lighting the card on the playfield below the standup. Hit the target three times, you get Blackjack. Scoring goes like this:\n\n1st Hit: 20,000\n2nd Hit: 50,000\n3rd Hit: 200,00, the *A* in CASINO, advance the Win Meter, and 75 Chips.\n\nThis pattern remains the same, except each subsequent win doubles the chip value, maxing out at 1200.\nThe little fly in the ointment in this game is the *Bust Card* target, located next to the Blackjack Table. It lights after you are *dealt* two of the three sevens . If you hit the Bust Card, you are dealt a Queen, giving you a hand of 24, and *busting*. No chips, and the Blackjack Table resets to no cards. Bust is deactivated during multiball\nOperator Adjustments:\n\n1. No 21 Busts: Determines how often the Bust card lights. Settings are after 1-3 successful Blackjacks, always, or never. Since the Bust card is very easy to hit by accident, this feature can really get in the way of ever spelling CASINO. (Ad 38)\n\n*S* Slot Shot\nThis involves the Slot Machine ramp, the Winning Streak Loop, and the Right Return Lane.\nThe Slot Ramp may be lowered in one of two ways:\n\n1. Completing consecutive Winning Streak shots. The ramp stays down until shot is made.\n2. Rolling over right return lane. Ramp will time out.\n\nThe number of consecutive Winning Streak shots needed to lower the Slot Ramp will increase, even if you lower the ramp via the return lane, and make the shot before it times out. Without dragging out the explanation, it comes down to this: The number of Winning Streak shots needed increases by one for *each made Slot Shot*, regardless of\nhow the ramp was lowered. It maxes out at 5 shots needed.\nWhen the ramp is down, a large blue arrow lights, exactly like the Royal Flush arrow. Making the Slot Shot locks a ball for Multiball, awards 100,000 points, the *S* in CASINO, advances the Win Meter and gives a random award. This random award turns the score display briefly into a three reel slot machine. The *reels* have either BAR,\nBELL, 777, or STAR on them. The awards are as follows:\n\nSlotPointsChips\nAny three50,000none\n2 Bells100,00025\n2 Bars200,00050\n2 777s300,00075\n3 Bells1,000,000100\n3 Bars2,000,000200\n3 777s3,000,000+Special300\n3 StarsSecond Chancenone (I believe)\n\nNote that ANY time a star shows up in the slot machine, it counts as a *Lucky Star* towards SECOND CHANCE. If two stars show up, they both count as well.\nAfter your Slot Machine Award, a second ball is delivered to the plunger. This ball is set up for a skill shot. After that, make or miss, you begin the two ball *Winning Streak Multiball*.\nMultiball seems LESS important on RG than on almost any pin of the modern era. This may be true at the lower difficulty levels, but with a machine set on Extra Hard, it can be about the only way to raise the Win Meter to the top for Jackpot. Additionally, it does make Blackjack much easier by eliminating the Bust card.\nThe only features that are different:\n\n1. The Winning Streak loop is now worth 100,000 points, an advance of the Win Meter, and 25 chips. While you are in Multiball, you cannot lower the Slot Ramp via the Winning Streak shot, regardless of how many you make. You *can* lower it via the return lane. If you do, the game gives out the usual awards, and Multiball continues.\n2. Since you are on a *Winning Streak* you cannot lose at Blackjack. The BUST card does not light during MB.\n3. Every switch scores a chip, in addition to whatever else it may award you. There is no Jackpot to go for during MB. In fact, you cannot play Roulette again until you return to one ball play.\n\nNear as I can tell, this is a *truly* random feature. Adjustments affect payoff and your ability to activate the feature more than they affect what comes up on the reels.\nOperator Adjustments:\n\n1. Second Chance Percent: Can be set for 1-30%, or OFF (Ad 33)\n2. Maximum Second Chance: Can stack 0-9 Extra Balls per ball (Ad 11)\n3. Special Percent: Can be set for 1-10%, or OFF. (Ad 32)\n4. Special Award: Credit, Second Chance, or 1,000,000 points (Ad 07)\n5. Maximum Credits: Can be set for 5-10. (Ad 12)\n6. Consecutive Ramps for Lock: 2-5 looped Winning Streaks to lower ramp. Note that this number increases to a maximum of 5 regardless of starting point. (first time-2, second time-3, etc.) (Ad 39)\n7. Winning Streak Timer: Consecutive defined as 5-15 seconds apart. (Ad 40)\n\n*I* Skill Shot\nPretty basic. Make the Skill Shot. The plunger lane ends in a ramp that raises right to left across the back of the playfield. A proper shot will go up the ramp, tripping the three bumper flasher switches, and then fall off the track, into the Roulette area. The bumper flasher switches are worth 10,000pts, 20,000pts, and 30,000 pts. The first time you make them, each scores a chip. After that (on that ball) they score 3 chips.\n<NEW>Each new skill shot on the same ball allows you to increase the number of flashing bumpers. If you get more switches than the previous shot, you get more flashing bumpers. The same or fewer switches simply keeps the number the same. You never lose a flashing bumper until you drain the ball, unless your next ball is a Second Chance ball. On a Second Chance ball, you start with as many bumpers as were flashing when you drained.\nThis skill shot starts at 100,000, and increases by 100,000 for each ball played, REGARDLESS of whether or not the shot was made. Example: On the first ball, the shot is worth 100k. Whether or not you make the shot, the value on the second ball will be 200k. Second Chance balls count. So, if you are playing a three ball game, and win two Second Chances, the value of the final skill shot will be 500k. If the ball winds up at the plunger multiple times during one ball, (Slot Shot, passage above right outlane, air-ball, etc.), the value remains whatever it was at the beginning of the ball.\n<BUG>: There is a slight bug here. At 10 through 15 balls, the value does advance (1 million, 1.1 m, up to 1.5m). However, the score display will read:\nSKILL SHOT00,000\nYou will get your proper points, you just can't tell from the display.\n<BUG>: At ball 16, the skill shot awards ZERO points. The display reads: SKILL SHOT\nwith nothing in the bottom two displays.\nAt 17 balls, the skill shot awards 100,000 again, the display works properly, and I assume the whole circus begins again.\nSkill Shot also awards 100 chips, opens the Roulette table, advances the Win Meter, and awards the *I* in CASINO. It may be the most important Skill Shot in modern pinball.\nOperator Adjustments: None\n*N* Roulette\nThis one takes some explaining. It is the center focus of the entire game, and is the one point that most unbalances the scoring. This is also the feature that can keep a newbie in a game against *anybody* due to the sheer random nature of the beast. It's one of the reasons I love it.\nThe Roulette feature involves the Roulette Wheel, Chips Display, Break The Bank Display, Win Meter, and the Lockdown Bar\nTo receive the *N* in CASINO, you must win at the Roulette table, simple as that. However, Roulette itself gets a bit involved.\nFirst, you must open the Roulette Table. This is done by:\n\n1. Making the Skill Shot, or\n2. Winning 100 chips in any fashion on the playfield.\n\nIf you make the skill shot, you play roulette immediately. Otherwise, the table must be open, and then you must make the Winning Streak shot. The machine will ask you to pick a color. You can choose Red, Black, Green, or Pass (white). If you win, you get 100 chips, and one advance of the win meter. If you bet Green and win, you get 800 chips, and the Win Meter goes to the top. The Roulette wheel stays open as long as you win.\nYou can tell if the Roulette table is open either from 2 speech cues:\n*Play Roulette* (female)\nor\n*Play Roulette for Jackpot* (male)\nAdditionally, a white arrow under the slot ramp lights, as does a sign saying PLAY ROULETTE, located just below the glass at the back or the playfield.\nIf you lose, you lose 100 chips, and must reopen the roulette wheel. Your lost chips go into the *Break The Bank* Jackpot, adding 100,000 (number of chips times 1,000).\nIf you pass, nothing happens, and you keep playing pinball. Of course, you don't get the *N* either.\nAll this changes if you are playing for Jackpot. Jackpot is lit when the Win Meter is advanced to the top (7 lights). If you lose on your first Jackpot attempt of a given round, you lose half your chips to *Break the Bank* (Number of chips times 1000). The roulette table closes.\nExample: You have 1500 chips. The Jackpot is 5,600,000. You bet red. It lands black. You now have 750 chips, and the Jackpot stands at 6,350,000. You must reset the Win Meter to try again.\nIf you begin with an odd number of chips, you lose half plus one. That extra chip is simply erased. It does not go to you nor to the Jackpot. Example:\nYou have 1501 chips. The Jackpot is 5,600,000. You bet red. It lands black. You now have 750 chips, and the Jackpot stands at 6,350,000. You must reset the Win Meter to try again.\nIf you win the Jackpot, you get all the points in *Break the Bank* plus 1000 chips! As long as you keep winning, and don't drain, you can keep collecting the Jackpot.\nIf, after winning one or more Jackpots, you then lose, the roulette table closes, you lose HALF your chips, and the Jackpot resets to 3,000,000 plus the value of half your chips times 1,000. Example:\nYou have 1500 chips. The Jackpot is 5,600,000. You bet red. It lands black. You now have 750 chips, and the Jackpot stands at 3,750,000. You must reset the Win Meter to try again\nIf you win a Jackpot, then drain, you keep your chips, and the Jackpot resets to 3,000,000.\nIf the wheel lands on a Star, you get that color, plus the Lucky Star.\nThe Jackpot, like in Taxi, carries from game to game and player to player.\nThere is a bit of strategy involved in Roulette. If you have 4000 chips, which means 4,000,000 bonus points, and the Jackpot stands at 3,000,000, do you risk 2,000,000?\nOperator Adjustments:\n\n1. Win Meter Start: Win Meter starts at 1-4 lights. (Ad 42)\n2. Win Meter Timer: This can be nasty. The win meter will drop by one if you don't win something in a specified period of time. (Ad 43)\n3. Jackpot Percentage: You always wondered if it was fixed. The answer is *Maybe*. The choices for awarding of Jackpot are 5% thru 30%, or Normal. Normal means Jackpots are awarded truly randomly. (Ad 45)\n4. Front Buttons Broken: In case the Lockdown Bar buttons break, the machine will just choose a color for you whenever it plays Roulette. (Ad 46)\n\n*O* CHIPS\nThe *O* in CASINO is Awarded by completing the bank of five CHIPS standup targets. Completing CHIPS scores 100,000 points, awards either 10, 20, or 50 chips, or a star, advances the Win Meter, and lights the *O* in CASINO. The number of chips is determined by what was lit when you lit the first standup. After completion, it cycles again, until hit and locked on an award level. This is subject to change on the last ball, if your score is low enough.\nOperator Adjustments:\nAbout the only impact adjustments have on CHIPS is if the Second Chance feature is disabled. Then the Star becomes fairly pointless.\n<6> Second Chance and Lucky Stars Explained \nThis Second Chance is not at all like the Second Chance you may have encountered in Dr. Who. In Dr. Who, Second Chance is a ball-saver. In Riverboat Gambler-ese, a Second Chance is an Extra Ball. You can obtain one (depending on setting) from points, a special, the Slot Machine, or by collecting 3 Lucky Stars. Stars may be collected in three ways:\n\n1. From one of the four spaces on the Roulette Wheel\n2. From the Slot Machine\n3. From the CHIPS standups\n\nWhen you receive a Star, it lights up on the backglass, just above the scoring display. Collect three of them, and you get a Second Chance. As explained earlier, this can be affected by a couple of settings:\n\n1. Second Chance Percent: Can be set for 1-30%, or OFF (Ad 33)\n2. Maximum Second Chance: Can stack 0-9 Extra Balls per ball (Ad 11)\n\nRiverboat Gambler calls it a *Second Chance* for very good reason. If Second Chance is lit, and you drain, it's like an extension of the ball you were playing. All features remain exactly as they are, including Jackpot staying lit if you've already won a Jackpot. Normally, draining after a made Jackpot resets *Break The Bank* to 3,000,000. Thus, you truly get a *Second Chance*, as you can try for Jackpot immediately off the skill shot.\nAdditionally, when you get a Second Chance, the bonus doesn't count until you finish your Second Chance ball(s). The only way to combine bonus and Second Chance is to have one awarded on points while the bonus is counting down from a previous ball. Of course if you do this, the features don't carry over.\nThe *Second Chance* light is located between the flippers, in good, old fashioned EB Orange. It doesn't say *shoot again*, it says:\n(Warning-rough ASCII approximation follows)\nLUCKY\n* * *\n2ND\nCHANCE\n<7> Easter Eggs \nSince this is an older game with an alpha-numeric display, we're not exactly talking about dancing cows here. So far, the only one I know of (during the game) in the L-3 ROM package is this:\nWith game on, and ball at plunger, press and hold the Red & Black buttons. Then press PASS 3 times, Black 3 times, Red 3 times, and Green 3 times. The display will *shimmer*. Then press Black & Red together. The display will say\nHELLO WORLD\nThose who keep track of such things will realize that there is also a HELLO WORLD in High Speed II: The Getaway. Both RG and HSII feature Dwight Sullivan software.\nIn HSII, it works like this:\n\"Hello World\" gets displayed when you have a ball in the shooter lane and do flipper sequences 3L 1R 3L 1R 3L 2R\nThere is a fair amount of stuff going on in Attract Mode to keep you amused.\nRED or BLACK button starts a display cycle of all the CASINO events. If the Attract Mode Sound (Ad 31) is on, the SLOT MACHINE sounds will play as the display shows the SLOT landing on 777 777 777. Curiously, this appears to be the only sound made in attract mode.\nGREEN button shows Replay score (or Second Chance, or Ticket).\nPASS (White) button displays HIGH ROLLERS (Four top scores)\nSTART will display *Credits 0*, or start the game.\nThere is a custom message feature in Riverboat Gambler. <Ad 49> It allows you to input 3 lines of alpha-numeric text, 16 characters per line. The available characters are:\nA thru Z (all CAPS)\n0 thru 9\n< > ? - / * '\nA. thru Z. (all CAPS, all letters followed by a period)\n(a blank space)\nNote-the special characters are for custom message only. When inputting initials for HSTD, the only characters available are A-Z and the blank space.\nThe message is displayed in the top portion of the display (player 1& 2 area). It *moves* onto the display, left to right, and then moves off to the right.. After power-cycling the game, the custom message appears immediately after PUSH START. The default message from the factory is actually longer than 3 x 16. It is:\nEARN THE RIGHT\nTO PLAY ROULETTE\nCOME RIDE THE\nRIVERBOAT\nThey get away with this because RIVERBOAT exists in the ROM as a standalone. It's the first thing that pops up when you turn the game on\n<8> Compensations, etc. \nThe ball will be returned to the plunger lane if you manage zero points. This is difficult, but possible.\nThere is a Compensation Ball feature on the machine. If, on the final ball, your score is significantly low, (apparently below 1 million) the machine does the following:\nYou are advanced to two Lucky Stars, regardless of how many you had to begin with. Then, it changes the CHIPS award from whatever it was to *STAR*. This means you only need to complete the CHIPS standups to be awarded a SECOND CHANCE.\n<9> Rolling Over \nYes, you can roll Riverboat Gambler over. I've done it a couple of times legitimately, including a game that featured around 12 Jackpots, 5 CASINOs, 3 Second Chances. Wound up with 149 Million (game set on *Easy*, 5 balls, Random Jackpots)\nWhen you go over 100 million, it's just like rolling over an odometer. There is no 100 Millions digit on the display. As far as the machine is concerned, you've started over. If you have a replay set at a particular level, you'll get it again. Mine is set to award a *Second Chance* at 9.6M. It awarded that again, at 109,600,000.\nThe depressing part is this: You DON'T make the High Score list. Basically, if you want to be king of the hill, you gotta tilt at 99M.\n<10> Pricing and similar adjustments \nThere is (if activated by Ad 51) a half price buyin feature. At the end of a game, it allows you to purchase a credit for half the normal price. The timer lasts ten seconds, and is displayed in the lower right of the display. WARNING: The message that you can buyin for 1/2 price flashes by VERY quickly. Be on the lookout for the timer.\nYou can buy in one credit per previous game played. I.E.: One player game-you can buy one half price credit. Four player game-you can buy 4 half price credits.\nReplays and such things:\nThe factory default (US) replay setting is 7 million. This level can be fixed anywhere between 800k and 9.8M(Ad 2) Or, the machine will average replays every 50 games to award between 5-25% replays (Ad 1)\nThere can be up to 4 replay levels (Ad 3). Example: if there were four, the first might be at 8M, then 16M, 24M, and 32M.\nThe replay boost can range from fair & equitable to downright miserly. It can be set (Ad 52) anywhere between 1-50 million (in 1M increments)\nThe backup High Scores To Date can be set anywhere from 0 to 9.9M. The factory default (US) is 7M, 7.5M, 8M, 8.5M\nThe initials that accompany the 4 backup HSTD all relate to people, who at the time of production, were in WMS pinball software division.\n\n#1-XAQ\nThis is Dwight Sullivan's *handle*.

{"page_content": "Riverboat Gambler Quick-Take\nby Scott Piehler\nspiehler@yahoo.com\n\nSince my rulesheet for Riverboat Gambler turned into the vision of an\nobsessive completist, I decided to write this quick-take for those who\njust want to play the silly thing!\n\n\nBasic gameplay summary:\n-Enable roulette wheel by either making the skill shot or earning 100\nbonus chips.\n-Enable roulette jackpot by advancing the backglass win-meter to the\ntop.  Do this by winning the various CASINO games.\n-Win at roulette by making the lit shot, and betting correctly using\nthe buttons on the lockdown bar.\n-Complete various tasks to spell CASINO for 2 Million points\n-Earn 3 stars for a second chance Extra Ball\n\nMultiball:\nA two ball, no-jackpot affair that is started by making the Slot Shot.\nScoring: as in regular play, except each switch also scores a bonus\nchip, the BUST CARD is inactive, each WINNING STREAK shot advances the\nWin Meter.\n\nCASINO Games\n(Note-each game you win advances the win meter)\n\nCASINO strategy-If possible, save C for last. Since the award can be\nlooped, the first shot will complete CASINO. The second shot will\nlight C to begin spelling CASINO again. *Much* easier.\n\nC-5 Card. Knock down targets and/or shoot the right ramp to spot\nplayfield cards.  Shoot ramp when ROYAL FLUSH arrow is lit to score\n500,000 points, 100 or 200 bonus chips, and light C. Royal Flush may\nbe collected multiple times via looping.\n\nA-Blackjack-Shoot the top right standup target 3 times without hitting\nthe BUST card standup to score progressive bonus chips and points, and\nlight A.\n\nS-Slot Machine. Lower the slot ramp by looping Winning Streak shot, or\nrolling over lit right inlane. Shoot left ramp when down to receive a\nrandom award (including stars), light S, and begin Multiball.\n\nI-Skill Shot-Make plunger skill shot to score progressive points,\naward 100 bonus chips, light I, and play Roulette.\n\nN-Roulette-Correctly bet on Roulette wheel using buttons on lockdown\nbar. Award is 100 bonus chips, (800 for a successful bet on GREEN), or\nJackpot, depending on Win Meter.  Lose on regular bet-lose 100 bonus\nchips. Lose Jackpot bet-lose 1/2  your bonus chips. You must bet\nsuccessfully to light N. Win or lose, 4 of the 16 roulette spaces\naward a star. A winning GREEN bet advances the Win Meter immediately\nto the top.\n\nO-CHIPS-Complete CHIPS standups to receive lit award (can be a star)\nand light O.\n\nStrategy:\nThe only way to really roll up monster scores is to be lucky at\nJackpot Roulette. Barring that, here are some things you can do\nskill-wise.\n\nROYAL FLUSH is the most lucrative skill-based game on the playfield.\nSince it can be looped, you can roll up millions very quickly. Each\nloop also advances the win meter, so it's a great way to set up\nJackpot Roulette.\n\nThe only CHIPS standup award really worth going for is Star. Trap ball\non left flipper and time your shot when the award is strobing to\nselect Star at every opportunity.\n\nMultiball is the best time to collect Blackjack, since the BUST card\nis disabled.\n\nBecome proficient with the bi-directional lane change, since it's the\neasiest way to lower the slot ramp.\n\nMake the skill shot! It's worth 100,000 times the ball in play. It\nalso instantly starts roulette, and makes the bumpers worth more bonus\nchips.\n\nThis game really rewards flipper passing, and it's fairly easy to do.\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Riverboat Gambler", "possible_shots": "-Skill shot -Roulette wheel -Roulette jackpot -CASINO games -Extra Ball -Slot Shot -5 Card -Blackjack -Slot Machine -Skill Shot -Roulette -CHIPS standups", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/riverboatgambler-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

It isn't quite as long as Rules/tz.sigma,\nbut give us some time. ;)\n\nVersion 0.5  Larry Hastings's rule sheet based on prototype ROMs, and the\nversion upon which this sheet is based.  Larry also gets credit for much of\nthe humor in this sheet.\n\nVersion 0.2  Larry's initial revision.\n\nVersion 0.1  Early overview of the game, by Bowen Kerins.\n\n\nThanks go out to:\n\n Larry Hastings\n Cameron Silver\n Bowen Kerins\n Ken Chaney\n Neil Shatz\n Rod Magnuson\n Dan Farris\n Steve Baumgarten\n Gr*g D*nl*p\n Steve Bollinger\n Mark Divitini\n Dave Stewart\n Martin Keates\n Petter Aaberg\n Alan Mitsugi\n Mike Mattress\n\n<2> Overview\nRed and Ted, the Road Busters, are a couple of fun-loving demolition\nexperts crossing the country on their bulldozer.  They cause immense mayhem and\ndestruction, but we love 'em anyway.  Help them destroy civilization by\naccumulating miles to get to cities, by buying souvenirs for big prizes, and by\npassing the days of the week.  And by giving them occasional iron supplements.\n\nRoad Show is a four-ball widebody Williams pinball game with four\nflippers, two talking plastic heads (Red and Ted), eighteen modes, stereo DCS\nsound, a shaker motor, two ramps, two loops, two plungers, two start buttons\n(just kidding), three bumpers, and a kajillion other assorted targets.  It\nfeatures both kinds of music (country AND western), and in fact has the voice,\nmusic, and likeness of Carlene Carter, a real live female country music star.\n\nSince this is Pat Lawlor's first pin since Twilight Zone (Pat is the\ngenius who gave us The Addams Family, FunHouse, Whirlwind, Earthshaker, and\nBanzai Run) some of us had been quite anxious to see his newest baby.  What\nwould he come up with next?\n\nAs it turns out, it's something of a pastiche of his earlier games.\nGamers familiar to pinball will see things in the exact same place as in a\nprevious Lawlor game.  The game strikes one as evolutionary, rather than\nrevolutionary.  Still, Pat Lawlor on even a bad day is better than a drawer\nfull of anybody else.\n\nThis is a wonderful game.  The rules are quite solid, if perhaps not\ninspired, and the Williams support team did an excellent job with the sounds,\nmusic, and animation.\n\nWilliams took this opportunity (the debut of a new Lawlor game) to make a\nfundamental change.  We suppose it was meant as a spoonful of sugar to help the\nmedicine go down.  Anyway, with Road Show, the end-of-game match is OFF by\ndefault.  Some folks claim that it compensates by giving out 7% more Specials,\nbut that seems specious.   It's possible to enable the match, but the thinking\nis that most people will leave it off.\n\nRoad Show also introduces the 1/2 credit buy-in (nothing special about it,\njust a cheap extra ball), and the daily high-score list (which resets every\nnight at midnight).\n<3> Playfield Description\nStarting at the lower-left and going clockwise, here's the layout of Road Show:\n\n\nLeft Inlane  Your standard inlane.  It lights Bridge Out on the Right Ramp\n\nLeft Outlane  Can be lit for a special.\n\nRocks Plunger  This plunger is in the same spot as the left plunger in\nFunHouse, and the Rose plunger in GnR.  The ball is fed here when you shoot\nthe Left Ramp when lit for Flying Rocks.  The plunger sends the ball up a\nhabitrail.  If you plunge softly, the ball will come back to rest at the\nplunger.  See the Flying Rocks section for more info.\n\nMiddle Left Flipper  A Thing-sized flipper which sits above and a tad to the\nleft of the Left Outlane.  The setup is similar to the left side of TAF,\nalthough the area is much more cramped and it's easier to drain down the\nOutlane.  Balls are fed to this flipper from the Left Loop, the Right Ramp\n(when diverted), and the bottom exit from the Flying Rocks Plunger.  Use\nthis flipper to hit the various targets of the Blast Zone.\n\nLeft Loop  This is a U-turn lane which feeds the Middle Left Flipper.  The\nentrance is positioned similarly to the Car Crash on DM.  There is a rubber\nstopper which slows down balls that come through this loop, so the ball\nwon't go screaming past the Middle Left Flipper.  There is a white \"Shoot\nHere\" light that lights when some mode award is available here.\n\nUpper Left Flipper  This is a full-sized flipper that lies along the left side\nof the Spinner Lane.  Use it to hit the Bulldozer, Red, and the Radio\nTargets.\n\nThe Magic Standup (tm)  This is a backwards-facing standup target that lies\nbelow the tip of the Upper Left Flipper.  The best way to hit this target is\nnot to flip at balls which roll down the Spinner Lane.  This standup is\nworth going for, as it has mystical powers which result in easy points.\nMore Later.\n\nSpinner Lane and Bob's Souvenir Bunker  A short lane running past the Upper\nLeft Flipper and into a sinkhole.  Locked balls are held there.  Balls\nexiting the lock come back down this lane.  Amazingly, balls coming into and\nout of the lock don't collide.  This hole is used for many things, including\ncollecting extra balls.  There are two lights here, LOCK (yellow) and EB\n(orange).  Above and behind the hole is a yellow globe light which is on\nwhen you can collect a Souvenir here.\n\nLeft Ramp  Placed similarly to the Neutral Zone in TNG.  It normally feeds the\nball back to the Inside Right Inlane, but the ball can be diverted to the\nLeft Inlane.  This also has a \"Shoot Here\" light, which lights when a mode\naward, Shooter Bypass, or Flying Rocks is available here.  Above the ramp is\na Bridge Out sign, with two red LEDs which flash when Bridge Out is\navailable here.\n\nBulldozer Blade  A yellow plastic bulldozer blade, which completely blocks off\nTed's head in its normal position.  During Multiball, it will rotate up and\nexpose Ted's mouth.  The Bulldozer is used to light locks and raise the\nMultiball jackpot.  The blade itself doesn't register hits - there are\nproximity switches below the board that register bulldozer hits.  There is\nalso a proximity switch behind the blade, which detects when a ball is\ncaught behind the lowered blade.\n\nTed  A giant head with moving eyes, eyelids, and mouth.  When the Bulldozer is\nraised, you can shoot balls into Ted's mouth.  Balls that go into his mouth\ncome out of the Lock.  Ted is used to start Multiball and collect jackpots.\n\nCenter Loop  This loop starts to the right of the Bulldozer and comes out in\nthe Bumpers.  There is a rollover switch just as the lane turns to the\nright, which you must hit to get credit for a shot to this Loop.  This shot\nhas a \"Shoot Here\" light which lights when a mode award is available here,\nand a \"Light Bob's\" light which indicates you can relight Bob's Souvenir\nBunker here.\n\nRed  Another giant head.  Red is placed at a similar angle as Rudy on FunHouse.\nRed's mouth is unobstructed, and can easily be hit from the Upper Left\nFlipper.  Hits to Red are detected with a proximity switch.  Red spits out\nany balls that find their way into her mouth.  Shoot Red for Big Millions\nand Multiball jackpots.\n\nRadio Targets  Five total, one orange standup on each side of the lane leading\nto Red's mouth, and a bank of three red standups to the left of the Bumpers.\nIn front of the three-bank is a white \"Radio\" light, which flashes when the\nRadio Targets are lit for something special.\n\nJet Bumpers  Three of 'em, one white, one red, and one orange, arranged in a\nwild new triangular pattern.  The Bumpers score points (1M per hit if Jets\nat Max is lit), add to the Blast Value, change the current Wheel award, and\nincrease the frenzy value during the Miami mode.\n\nRight Ramp  One of Pat Lawlor's trademarks is a shot through bumpers.  On Road\nShow, this is it.  The lane through the bumpers is pretty wide compared to\nTZ and TAF.  Normally balls are fed to the Inside Right Inlane, but when\ndiverted they go all the way around the back of the board to the Middle Left\nFlipper.  Two lights here: Shoot Here, and Million Plus.  Above the entrance\nis a Bridge Out sign, just like the sign on the Left Ramp.\n\nPlastic Radio  This sits to the right of the Bumpers.  It has a yellow globe\nlight that flashes when the Radio targets are lit for something.\n\nStart City Scene  This is a scoop placed similarly to TZ's Slot Machine, but a\nbit closer to the flippers.  Balls that fall in the scoop are kicked out of\nthe scoop, and should go directly at the Right Flipper for an easy drop\ncatch or bounce pass.  This scoop is used in the Butte mode, but there are\nno lights to indicate that.  There is a yellow globe light above the hole\nwhich flashes when you can start a mode here.  (See Bugs)\n\nBlast/Wheel Hole  This is a rather large sinkhole which can be entered from the\nleft or right side.  Balls that drop in here are kicked out of the Start\nCity Scene scoop.  When Start City Scene is lit, you can start a mode by\nhitting this hole, too.  This hole is used to score Blasts, the Skill Shot,\nand in some modes.\n\nBlast Targets  Three yellow standups arranged in an arc, facing down/left.\nWhen an award is lit here, you only need to hit one of the targets to\ncollect it.  There is a big white flasher-light labeled \"Collect Blast\nValue\" that lights for: Blast, Double/Triple Blast, Big Blast, Super Blast,\nMega Blast, Immense Blast, Cataclysmic Blast, Incomprehensibly Large Blast,\nYou're Not Going To Believe This Blast, and Itty Bitty Teensy Weensy Baby\nBlast after a successful Bean Eating Mania.  (Okay, okay, those last six\nwere made up by Larry, and Super Blast is actually collected at the\nBlast/Wheel Hole. :)\n\n***NOTE***  Road Show uses the term \"Blast Zone\" ambiguously.  Sometimes it\nmeans \"the Blast Targets\" and sometimes \"the Blast Targets or the\nBlast/Wheel hole\".  The distinction between those two is important, so this\nrule sheet will not use the term \"Blast Zone,\" but instead specify which\ntargets need to be hit.\n\nSkill Shot Lane  This lane runs past the right side of the Blast/Wheel Hole.\nBalls can come down this lane from the Bumper area, and the plunger sends\nballs up this lane.  There is a one-way gate which deflects balls coming\ndown over to the Right Inlane/Outlane area.  When that happens, the Left\nRamp lights for Shooter Bypass.\n\nPlunger  Good ol' reliable manual plunger.  Depending on how hard you plunge,\nthe ball can roll back to the plunger, roll down the Skill Shot Lane, land\nin the Blast/Wheel Hole for the Skill Shot, go up to the Bumper area, or hit\nthe Bulldozer.\n\nRight Inlanes  Another of Lawlor's trademarks is two Inlanes on one side.  The\nInside Inlane lights Bridge Out at the Left Ramp, and the Outside Inlane\nlights Bob's Bunker.  A ball shot to the Left Ramp and not diverted will\nreturn to the Inside Inlane.\n\nRight Outlane  This is a particularly wicked outlane.  It can be lit for a\nSpecial.\n\nSlingshots  Two normal triangular slingshots (but a bit on the small side) in\ntheir usual places.\n\nLower Flippers  Two full-sized flippers in the normal place.\n\nStandups  Scattered around the board are white, orange, and red standups.  They\nare used to change the lit mode, and during the Miami and Minneapolis modes.\n\nPlayfield lights  Just below the Bulldozer are twelve lights that make up the\nWheel.  Below those are five lights that show your current day of the week\n(see Multiball).  Moving down, there is the US map and the mode lights.\nBelow the map are the bonus multiplier lights.  And finally, between the\nflippers, the ever-popular Shoot Again light, which also indicates when the\nball saver is active.\n\nShaker motor  Inside the cabinet, about six inches in front of the coin box and\nsix inches left of center, is the shaker.  It's a motor spinning an\noff-center weight, which when turned on causes the whole machine to shake.\nIt's used to punctuate gameplay (especially when you collect blasts).\n\n<4> General Rules and Scoring\n\nBall Saver  The Ball Saver is turned on at the start of each ball, and can save\nthe ball *one* time during each ball.  It also lights at the start of either\nmultiball mode.  If you drain BOTH balls while the ball saver is lit, the\nmode will end and you'll get one ball back.\n\nSometimes, the Phantom Ball Saver may activate.  This has been reported\nto occur when the ball drains Lock -> SDTM or Red -> Left Outlane.\n\nSkill Shot  Anytime you have a ball at the Plunger (except after two locks\nduring a West Coast mode), shoot the ball into the Blast/Wheel Hole without\nhitting anything else to score the Skill Shot.  The award is a free\nsouvenir, along with 5M the first time, 10M the second, etc., to a max of\n25M.\n\nYou can also score a Skill Shot anytime the ball rolls up the Skill\nShot lane and lands in the Blast Hole.  This usually happens after the ball\nis kicked off the left Slingshot.\n\nShooter Bypass  Any time a ball rolls down the Skill Shot Lane, the Left Ramp\nwill be lit for Shooter Bypass in addition to anything else already lit\nthere.  The award is 5M the first time, 10M the second, etc., to a max of\n25M.\n\nSpinner scoring   When the game is power-cycled, the Spinner value resets.  It\nbegins at only a few hundred points per spin.  It gradually increases, to a\nfew thousand points, then a couple hundred thousand, etc., until it reaches\nits max of 1M per spin.  This value holds over between players and games.\nCollecting a \"Spinner at max\" award from the Wheel immediately sets the\nSpinner at 1M.  Power-cycling is the only thing that resets the Spinner's\nvalue.\n\nIn LA-5, this has changed.  The Spinner value resets to 1,000 at the\nstart of each ball.  We think this bites.\n\nBridge Out and Bonus Multipliers  Bridge Out can be collected at any time\nduring the game.  Light the Right Ramp by rolling through the Left Inlane,\nor light the Left Ramp by rolling through the Inside Right Inlane.  Bridge\nOut remains lit for a few seconds.  Hitting a lit Ramp will activate that\nRamp's diverter.  There is no grace period for Bridge Out, although there IS\na grace period for the diverters (meaning that a diverter may activate even\nthough you are not awarded a Bridge Out).\n\nEach Bridge Out advances the Bonus Multiplier from 1x to 2x, 3x, 4x,\n5x, and 6x.  After 6x, the next award is \"Light EB,\" which you can collect\nonce per game.  Advancing the multiplier lights the Wheel if it isn't\nalready lit.  After the multiplier reaches its max, Bridge Out shots award\n10M.\n\nThe downside to all this is that if you have the wheel lit when you\nadvance the multiplier to its max, the Wheel will be UNlit!.\n\nBig Millions  Anytime a ball is kicked out of the Lock, Red is lit for Big\nMillions for a short time.  Hit her mouth to score 5M the first time, 6M the\nsecond time, etc., to a max of 25M.  The value carries over during the\nentire game.\n\nCheeseburger Bonus  After enough Red hits, you'll be awarded the Cheeseburger\nBonus, worth 20M.  Red: \"You big Cheeseburger!\"\n\nFun With Bonus  2M * # of modes played\n+   1K * # of miles on that ball (maxes at 9,999 miles)\n+ 200K * # of blasts\n+ 10M for each souvenir+associated city combo\n\n... then multiply all that by the bonus multiplier.\n\n<5> Blasts\nThere are several ways of collecting a Blast.  Each time you collect a\nBlast at the Blast Targets, you are awarded the current Blast Value, which\nstarts at 1M and goes up by some odd amount (208,430) with each Bumper hit to a\nmax of 10M.\n\nThe most common way to light the Blast Targets by dropping a ball into the\nBlast/Wheel Hole or hitting the Magic Standup.  Shooting the Left Loop lights\nthe Blast Targets for a short time.  Hitting them awards 2x the Blast Value.\nShooting Bridge Out on the Right Ramp lights the Blast Targets for a short\ntime, and hitting them awards 3x the Blast Value.\n\nYou can also score a Super Blast by shooting either the Left Loop (\"Fire\nin the hole!\") or Bridge Out on the Right Ramp, and then the Blast/Wheel Hole.\nThis awards 5M the first time, 10M the second, and 15M afterwards.  It also\ncollects anything else that is lit at the Blast Hole.\n\nIf Big Blast is lit, hitting the Blast Targets awards 5x the Blast Value.\nThe flasher light in front of the Blast Targets will flash when Big Blast is\nlit.\nNote that you are always awarded one BLAST, regardless of the multiplier\napplied to the Blast Value.\n\nBlasts also work as a counter award, like Robots and Hitchhikers in TZ:\nFlying Rocks is lit at 3, EB is lit at between 5 and 14 (reflexes), Special is\nlit between 17 and 34 (reflexes), Flying Rocks at 40, EB lit at 50, Flying\nRocks again at 60 and 80.  Are there more after 80?\n<6> Flying Rocks\nFlying Rocks is akin to the Steps in FunHouse.  First light the Left Ramp\nby getting a Wheel award or enough Blasts (Flying Rocks can NOT be stacked at\nthe Ramp).  Hitting the Ramp sends the ball down to the left-hand plunger\n(using some cleverly-placed diverters).  A habitrail leads away from the\nplunger, and it has three exits.  Each exit has an award:\n\n\nBottom hole  Lite 5x Blast.  The ball is fed to the Middle Left Flipper for a\none-time shot at the Blast Targets.\nMiddle hole  Lite Radio Riot.  The ball is fed to the Left Inlane.  Each hit to\nthe three-bank of Radio Targets scores 10M for the rest of the ball.\nSometimes you'll hear air checks from radio stations: \"Turn your knob to\nBOB.  BOB 100 FM\", \"103.5 - WYNY.\"\nTop hole  Lite EB.  The ball is fed to the Inside Right Inlane, which is a\npretty good setup for a shot at the Lock.\n\n\nIf you send the ball past the top exit, it will hit Ted in the head!  This\nmakes Ted very sore and awards 25M.  The ball will roll back to the top hole\nand exit that way.\n\nHitting one of the lower three shots when lit unlights it.  The Lite 5x\nBlast hole is lit for you at the start of the game, and another is lit the\nfirst time you get the ball to the Rocks Plunger.  Hitting the Center Loop at\nany time also lights the next unlit Flying Rocks shot.  In any event, the shots\nare always lit in order from bottom to top, and you can collect only one EB\nfrom the Rocks per game.\n\nNote 1: If a ball goes airborne and lands at the Rocks Plunger, you will\nbe able to collect the Rocks awards, just as if you had gotten the ball there\nlegitimately.\n\nNote 2: hitting one of the three lower Rocks shots awards 10M if it was\nlit, and 5M if not.\n<7> The Wheel\nThe Wheel is a group of twelve various awards.  Light the Wheel by\nadvancing your bonus multiplier.  Collect a Wheel award by shooting the Lock or\nthe Blast/Wheel Hole.  You can relight the Wheel and collect Wheel awards at\nany time during the game.  When the Wheel is lit, all twelve lights will flash\ntogether, and a tick-tock sound effect will play.  Wheels cannot be stacked;\nonce you collect one award you must relight the Wheel.\n\nEach bumper hit moves the flashing Wheel award counterclockwise.  If the\nWheel is lit, each spin of the Spinner also moves the flashing award\ncounterclockwise.  Nothing happens when you collect all twelve awards; the\nWheel just quietly resets.\n\nHere are the awards:\n\n You're There \nImmediately lights Start City Scene and awards 5M * (number of modes\nyou've played + 1).  If you're currently in a mode, or if Start City Scene is\nalready lit, Start City Scene will be lit immediately at the end of the current\nor next mode respectively.  If you collect this award by shooting the\nBlast/Wheel Hole, and if there was not a mode running, the next mode will begin\nbefore the ball is kicked back into play.  (see Bugs)\n\n Flying Rocks \nLights the Left Ramp for Flying Rocks.\n\n Light Big Blast \nLights the Blast Targets for Big Blast.  This does not seem to time out,\nbut it will turn off if you drain without collecting it.\n\n Light Special \nDoes just what it says.  Red: \"Now isn't that special.\"  The Left Outlane\nis lit for Special at first, and the Special switches outlanes with each\nslingshot hit.\n\n Million Plus \nLights the Right Ramp for Million Plus, worth 6M the first time, and 1M\nmore each successive shot, to a max of 12M, for the rest of the ball.  Ted:\n\"You look like a million plus.\"\n\n Jets at Max \nEach Jet Bumper hit is worth 1M for the rest of the ball.  This award also\nstarts a neat light show in the lights that make up the border on the US map.\n\n Bad Weather \nA 25M Hurry-up is lit at the Lock.  It times out 5M.  Red: \"I HATE rain!\"\nCollecting the points gives the quotes: Ted: \"Look, a rainbow!\"  Red: \"Wow!\"\nIf you collect this award from the Blast Hole when Start City Scene is lit, the\nmode will not start.  Also, you cannot start a mode while Bad Weather is\nrunning.\n\n Spinner at Max \nSets the Spinner value to 1M per spin.  See Spinner Scoring in section 4\nfor more info.\n\n Hold Bonus \nAlso holds your multiplier.  (see Bugs)\n\n Lite EB \nDoes just what it says.  Red: \"Get that extra ball!\"\n\n Bob's Freebie \nAwards a free Souvenir.\n\n Lunch Time \nShows a pretty hot dog on the DMD and awards 15M. (Mmmm...fifteen million.\nOops, sorry, wrong cartoon character.)\n<8> Souvenirs\nSouvenirs are neat little toys that you can pick up during the game.  You\nget one for free every time you collect a Skill Shot or Bob's Freebie Wheel\naward.  You can also buy souvenirs (using points as your currency) from Bob's\nSouvenir Bunker, which is located at the Lock.\n\nBob's Bunker is lit by rolling through the Center Lane or the Outside\nRight Inlane.  But in order to get the chance to buy something at Bob's, you\nmust hit the Lock when nothing else is lit there, and when no mode is running.\n\nWhen you hit the Skill Shot, you are awarded a random Souvenir (but this\nis adjustable - see section 17).\n\nWhen you visit Bob's or collect a Bob's Freebie award, you see a cute\npicture of the facade of the Bunker, which has a changing sign in the window.\nThe first time you visit Bob's, you also see the bulldozer pull up to the door\nand park (complete with hissing air brakes!).\n\nThe sign can be one of the following:\n\n \"Home of the Big Rubber Spears\" (this is always the sign on your first visit)\n \"Free Water -- $1 a glass\"\n \"Uranium Ore $3 a Chunk\"\n \"Easy Credit -- Let's Talk\"\n \"Today's Special: Explosives\"\n \"Try Our Frosty Malts\"\n \"Dozer Parts On Sale Today\"\n \"Sale On Jackalopes\"\n \"Secret Video Mode: BRRRLLRRL\"\n \"Frenzy? Bwa haa ha ha!\"\n\n\nThen, a souvenir is picked at random, with an animation reminiscent of\nCFTBL's Snack Bar.  You are then shown the price of the Souvenir.  Press the\nleft flipper to decline it, or the right flipper to buy it.  There are also\nsome joke souvenirs:  New Car, Pretty Rocks, Ashtray, Breath Spray, Uranium,\nAmmunition, Toothpicks, Lawn Darts, Poker Chips, Paperweight, Wooden Indian,\nAntacid, Towelettes (for when you get that not-so-fresh feeling).\n\nWhat are Souvenirs good for?  Well, you can sell them back at Albuquerque\n(usually for more than what you paid), and you can get extra points at Fun With\nBonus.  If you have a souvenir AND have visited the associated city, you get\n10M per souvenir.  So, if you have played the Miami mode and have 2 suntan\nlotions, you get 20M.\n\nRandom quotes for buying a souvenir:\n\n Ted: \"There goes the paycheck again\"\n Ted: \"The biggest bang for your buck, baby!\"\n Red: \"Hey, that's neat!\"\n Red: \"What a piece of JUNK\"\n Red: \"We came here for THIS?\"\n Red: \"What a waste of money!\"\n If you don't buy one, Red may say \"Thank goodness!\".\n\n\nHere are the souvenirs:\n\n\nSouvenirCostCity\nAir Freshener   20M     New York\nBaggy Shorts    20M     Seattle\nBaseball Cap    5M      Atlanta\nBelt Buckle     3M      Nashville\nBox Kite        8M      Kansas City\nBull Whip       7M      \nCoffee Mug      750K    Ohio\nCowboy Hat      6M      Dallas\nDeck of Cards   10M     Las Vegas\nFireworks       7M      New Orleans\nFool's Gold     20M     Denver   (40M in LA-3 and earlier)\nKey Chain       5M      \nPennant         1M      Chicago\nPicture Plate   5M         (see Easter Eggs)\nRoot Beer Mug   2M      \nRubber Nose     50M     \nRubber Spear    2M      Minneapolis\nSalt Shakers    750K    Salt Lake City\nSandals         12M     San Francisco\nShot Glass      ?       \nSunglasses      8M      Los Angeles\nSuntan Lotion   20M     Miami\nT-Shirt         4M      Albuquerque\nTreasure Map    10M     Butte\nWax Lips        15M     \n\n\nThere are also three special Pinball souvenirs.  They cannot be sold back\nat Albuquerque, but you get something right away when you buy them.\n\n\nLead Pinball    75M     lights EB\nZinc Pinball    100M    awards an EB\nGold Pinball    250M    awards an EB and lights Special\n\n\nThere have been rumors of a Platinum Pinball and a Uranium Pinball.\n\nIf the sign in the window reads \"Uranium Ore $3 a Chunk\" quickly hit both\nflippers.  (Here is another easter egg related to the number 3.)  This starts\nConstruction Mania, a 20-second mode with all targets worth 3M.  If you start\nConstruction Mania, you will not get a souvenir for that trip to Bob's.\n\nYou will never be offered a souvenir that costs more than you can afford.\nIf buying a souvenir drops your score under the replay score, you will not be\nawarded another replay if you pass the replay score again.\n<9> Multiball\nFirst, advance through the days by hitting the Bulldozer blade.  Each hit\nadvances you one day.  Red also announces the days as you go, and your progress\nis indicated on the playfield lights below the Wheel.  When you reach Friday,\nLock is lit at the Bunker, and both characters say something about payday, Ted:\n\"Where's my paycheck?\", Red: \"Pipe down!\"  You cannot advance days or lock\nballs while a City Scene mode is in progress.  If you take a while in locking\nball 1, Red will say: \"Put a cork in it!\" (referring to Ted's babbling about\nhis paycheck).\n\nLocking one ball awards 10K for each mile you've traveled on that ball (if\nyou have NO miles, you get a consolation prize of 10K), and Ted says \"Hey-hey,\npayday!  Party time!  Put on your dancin' shoes baby.\"\n\nLock 2 is then immediately lit.  Locking ball 2 awards another bonus for\nmiles, and you hear more chatter:\n\n\n Red: \"Payday!\", Ted: \"Whoa--I'm all worn out.\"\n Rad: \"Party time!\", Ted: \"*yawn* I'm shuttin' down.\"\n Ted then falls asleep, and (like most sleeping heads on pinball machines) his\nmouth hangs open.  The Bulldozer blade raises, exposing his mouth.  Shoot a\nball in there to start Multiball.\n\n\nAfter Ted swallows that ball you just shot in, all three balls are kicked\nout of the Lock.  That's a bit inconvenient since the first jackpot is at Ted's\nmouth.  The jackpot starts at 40M and goes up by 5M each time you hit the\nBulldozer Blade, to a max of 75M.\n\nThe first jackpot is at Ted's mouth, and the second is at Red's mouth.\nThe jackpots keep alternating between the two.  Whenever Ted is the next\njackpot, the Blade rises and lowers, making it a difficult shot.  When Red is\nthe next jackpot, the Blade stays down.  As soon as you collect one jackpot,\nthe other is lit immediately.\n\nWhen you score a jackpot, the DMD spells out the word JACKPOT once for\neach jackpot you've gotten (to a max of three times).  Kinda dull, really.\nScoring your first jackpot also starts some real country music going; Carlene\nsings about some hopelessly codependent relationship (\"I oughta keep you locked\nup at home.\")\n\nIf you drain two balls without getting a jackpot, multiball restart is lit\nat the Lock for 12 seconds.  Shooting the Lock restarts Multiball with two\nballs (see bugs).\n\nAt the end of Multiball, you may hear Ted say, \"Oh, my achin' head!\" or \"I\nfeel like I've been rode hard and put away wet.\"  If you get no jackpots,\nrestart, and still get no jackpots, Red will console you by saying \"You missed\nEVERYTHING!\"\n\nBetween locks 1 and 2, you might hear\n\n\n Ted: \"We're eatin' high off the hog tonight!\"\n Ted: \"I'm on easy street, baby!\"\n Red: \"What a GUY!\"\n\n\nOn the second and later Multiballs, Ted will say \"Put a fork in me, baby,\nI'm done\" after lock 2.\n\nAfter you light lock 1, but before you lock the first ball, hitting the\nBulldozer awards Overtime, which is worth 1.1M the first time, 1.2M the second,\nand so on to a max of 3M (and plays a neat \"whoosh\" sound effect).\n\nOn the second multiball, you need to advance through the days again after\nlocking the first ball, and the max value of the jackpot is 100M.  On the third\nmultiball you need 2 bulldozer hits to advance a day, and the max jackpot is\n125M.  Later multiballs need one more bulldozer hit to advance a day, and the\nmax jackpot goes up by 25M for each multiball.  The highest we've seen is 4\nhits to advance a day!\n\nOn LA-4 and earlier ROMs, the jackpot value carries over between\nmultiballs. On LA-5, the value can go down by 15M or so between multiballs.\n\nNote: The status report includes a screen that says \"x balls locked.\"\nThis tells you how many balls are physically in the Lock, which isn't\nnecessarily the same as how many balls you have locked.\n<10> City Scenes (modes)\nEach of the cities on the US map corresponds to a mode.  That's right,\neighteen of 'em!  The cities are roughly in a grid, 6 columns by 3 rows.  The\ntop row of lights is white, the middle row is yellow, and the bottom row is\norange.  It's not a perfect grid, though; in fact, from going from right to\nleft, the colors always rotate in the same order: white, orange, yellow.\n\nTo begin a mode, shoot either the Start City Scene scoop or the Blast Hole\nwhen the Start City Scene globe light is flashing.  You cannot start modes\nduring multiball, or when you have locked two balls and Ted is asleep.  You\nalso cannot have more than one mode running at a time (but see bugs).\n\nThe currently flashing mode is always one of the next two cities on the\nmap (going from right to left), so your first mode is either New York (white)\nor Miami (orange) -- the rightmost 2 cities on the map.  This means that you\ncan never play two modes of the same color in a row.  The exception to this\nrule is the West Coast cities - you can reach any of the three cities on the\ncoast.\n\nThe currently flashing mode changes when you hit a bumper or standup of\nthe same color as a city that you can reach at that time.  So for example, at\nthe beginning of the game, New York is the flashing mode, but hitting an orange\nbumper or standup changes the mode to Miami; and hitting a while bumper or\nstandup changes it back to New York.\n\nThe order of the cities from east to west is:\n\n\n New York\n Miami\n Atlanta\n Ohio         (This is in fact a *state*, not a city.)\n New Orleans  (or, as Red calls it, Nawlins)\n Nashville\n Chicago\n Dallas\n Kansas City\n Minnesota    (This is another state - but elsewhere this mode is called\n\"Minneapolis,\" which is a city.)\n Albuquerque\n Denver\n Butte\n Salt Lake City\n Las Vegas\n Seattle\n San Francisco\n Los Angeles\n\n\nAfter completing a mode, you need to travel 400 miles to re-light the\nStart City Scene scoop.  (If you're playing on a non-US machine, that will be\n400 kilometers.)  The various targets on the board award miles:\n\n\nLeft Loop                150 miles    \nLeft Ramp                100          \nRight Ramp               100          \nRight Loop                75          \nBlast Hole                75          \nStart City Scene Scoop    75          \nLock                      50          \nInlanes                   25          \nSpinner                    5 per spin \nBumpers                    5(?)       \nBulldozer Blade            ?          \nStandups                   ?          \n\n\nThe exact number of miles between cities is adjustable -- see section 17\nfor more details.\n\nOnce you complete a West Coast mode, you start over at New York.  The\ncities you've visited remain lit (so you can still collect bonuses from\nsouvenirs) but you can re-play modes on your way back to the West Coast.\n(Note: on L-2 and earlier ROMs, the cities turn off after the West Coast mode\nends.)\n\nA note about the Right Ramp: If both the Right Ramp and the Left Loop are\nlit at the same time, hitting the Ramp while Bridge Out is lit there will\ncollect BOTH the Ramp and the Loop awards (since the ball gets diverted to the\nLoop).  This is also a good combo for non-mode play, as it racks up 275 miles.\n\n New York City (Smash a Cab) \n\nThis is a timed mode (20 seconds?).  The bulldozer is stuck in a traffic\njam behind a bunch of taxi cabs.  Hit the bulldozer to mercilessly crush a cab.\nThe first hit is worth 3M, the second is worth 4M, etc., to a max of 8M.  You\nalso get 5M for starting the mode.  There is no grace period after the timer\nruns out.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards one taxi crush award (once only).\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey, look Ted, taxi cabs!\"\n Taxi Driver: (Indian accent) \"You will rrrremove that bulldozer frrrrom the\nstreet!\"\n Ted: \"Is that botherin' you, darlin'?\"\n Red: \"Go get him, Ted.\"\n\n\nSmashing a cab gives you one of the quotes from the cabbie:\n\n \"I am not afrrrraid of you!\"\n \"You have destroyed my taxicab.\"\n \"You have not heard the last of me!\"\n\n\nAt the end of the mode, the cabbie says\n\n \"You have not heard the last of me!\"\n\n\n Miami (Spring Break) \nThis is a 20-second timed mode.  All targets are worth 1M.  Hitting any\nbumper or standup adds 100K to the target value, to a max of 3M.  Obviously,\nthe Spinner or the Bumpers are the best places to shoot.  Each time you\nincrease the target value, the DMD shows a neat close-up picture of a guy\nbanging on the screen, or a girl blowing you a kiss. :*  Very reminiscent of\nTZ's Town Square Madness displays.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup raises the target value by 300K the first time\nyou hit it.  After that, it behaves like the other standups.\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, a beach party!\"\n Ted: \n Red: (perturbed) \"Jerk alert\"\n Ted: (ashamed) \"Oh, Red...\"\n\n\n Atlanta (Worker Trapped) \nThis is a hurry-up mode.  The hurry-up value begins at 35M and counts down\nto 5M.  Hit the Blast Targets or the Blast/Wheel Hole to collect the points.\nIf you shoot Left Loop -> Blast Targets, the hurry-up award is doubled.  And if\nyou shoot Right Ramp Bridge Out -> Blast Targets, it's tripled.  (see Bugs)  If\nBig Blast is lit, hitting the Blast Targets awards 5x the hurry-up value!\n\nThe Magic Standup adds 16M to the hurry-up value (once only).  Hitting the\nLock pauses the countdown for a few seconds.\n\nStart quotes:\n\n Voice on the radio: \"We interrupt this broadcast.  Construction accident.  Man\ntrapped in a Port-a-potty.\"\n Red: \"We'll fix that.\"\n Ted: \"Prepare for blasting.\"\n\n\nAfter collecting the points:\n\n BOOM!  ...  Ted: \"See, that didn't hurt a bit.\"\n And on the screen, one char-broiled worker.\n\n\nIf the hurry-up times-out, you'll hear:\n\n Red: \"You missed everything!\"\n\n\n Ohio (Trapped in Ohio) \nOur heros are being pursued by the cops!  Shoot either ramp to ditch one\npolice car (worth 10M), and then hit the other ramp to get away from the other\ncop (25M).  You also get 5M for starting the mode.  Hitting a ramp shows a\npolice car smacking head-on into a truck!\n\nHitting the Magic Standup spots one of the Ramps (once only).\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, poh-lice.\"\n Policeman: \"OK buddy, pull over!\"  (taken from High Speed)\n Ted: \"Officer Steve Speed.\"\n\n\nDuring the mode, you'll hear more High Speed quotes.\n\nAfter hitting the first ramp:\n\n Ted: \"Feels like a mosquito on a mack truck!\"\n\n\nAnd after hitting the other ramp:\n\n Red: \"Hey, we got away!\"\n\n\n  New Orleans (Mardi Gras) \nTed and Red have 20 seconds to clear as many people from the street as\nthey can.  Hit any Ramp or Loop to knock a person out of the way.  The\nparty-goers on the screen are the frozen people from Minneapolis, babes in\nbikinis from Miami, the Indian from Albuquerque, and the aliens from Seattle.\nYou get 5M for starting the mode, and shots are worth 5M, then 8M, then 12M,\nand 20M afterwards.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards the next two shot values (once only).\n\nStart quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, Mardi Gras!\"\n Ted: \"I knew I shoulda brought more than one T-shirt.\"\n\n\nDuring the mode:\n\n Red: \"Hey, watch where you're going.\"\n Ted: \"Watch out, coming through!\"\n Ted: (musically) \"Hey hey hey hey!\"\n\n\n Nashville (Change the Station) \nThis is a two-ball multiball.  A second ball is served to the plunger\n(since there is always at least one ball in the trough), and the mode lasts\nuntil you drain one ball.\n\nRed and Ted scream in agony as the radio blabs on.  7M starting bonus, and\nhitting any target in the 3-bank of Radio targets awards 10M the first time,\n11M the second, etc., to a max of 15M.  The station keeps changing, but talk\nradio always winds up coming back on.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards a radio hit (once only).\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Ted: \"It's ... TALK ... RADIO!\"\n Red: \"Change the station!\"\n\n\nDuring the mode:\n\n Radio: (tuning noises) \"Blah blah bawk bawk blah blah\"\n\n\n Chicago (Evil Toll Roads) \nYou have 15 seconds to blow up four toll booths.  Each Loop and Ramp\ncorresponds to a booth.  The first one is worth 7M, the next 10M, the third\n15M, and the fourth 20M.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup blows up one of the booths (once only).\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, Chicago.\"\n Ted: \"I HATE toll roads.\"\n Red: \"We'll fix that!\"\n\n\n Dallas (Monster Cab) \nThe cabbie is back with a big-toothed monster-truck cab.  Shoot a Ramp or\nLoop to lob a stick of dynamite at the cab.  (You can hit a shot more than\nonce.)  It takes four shots to destroy the cab.  The shots score 13M, 16M, 19M,\nand 22M.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards the next two shot values (once only).\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Oh no, he's back.\"\n Cabbie: \"You will pay for yourrrr insolence!\"\n Red: \"Let's get out of here!\"\n Ted: (a while later) \"I'll save ya, Red!\"\n\n\nEnding quote:\n\n Red: \"Ooooh, Ted.\"\n\n\n Kansas City (Tornado) \nThis is another two-ball multiball mode.\n\nStarting quote:\n\n \"The storm is coming ... return to your homes.\"  (taken from Whirlwind)\n\n\nYou get 8M for starting the mode.  A 25M hurry-up begins, and it counts\ndown to a minimum of 5M.  Shoot the Lock to take shelter and collect the\nhurry-up value (see Bugs), and reset it to 25M.  Any balls shot into the lock\nare kicked out after the award animation finishes.\n\nHitting any of the Radio targets in the 3-bank resets the hurry-up to 25M.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards the current hurry-up value (which will\nusually be 25M, since the Magic Standup has to be hit by a ball coming out of\nthe Lock) (once only).\n\n Minneapolis (Frozen People) \nOur heroes have a sudden benevolent streak, and they decide to thaw a few\nfrozen people.  There are six frozen people - hit any standup EXCEPT a Blast\nTarget to unfreeze a person and collect 10M.  You get 10M for starting the\nmode, and a 25M bonus for unfreezing all 6 people.\n\nHitting any Blast Target ends the mode and fries the remaining people.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup the first time thaws two people.  On later hits\nit behaves like a regular standup.\n\nStarting quote:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, frozen people.\"\n Ted: \"We'll fix that.\"\n\n\nBlowing them up gives:\n\n Red: \"Oh no!\"\n Ted: \"Oops.\"\n\n\n Albuquerque (Trading Post) \nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, a trading post.\"\n Native American: \"How ... much?\"\n\n\nThis city isn't a mode - it's a trading post where you can sell back all\nthe souvenirs you have at the time (except Pinballs).  The Indian will buy them\nfrom you at anywhere from 1x to 7x the value of the souvenirs (the multiplier\nwill equal your current bonus multiplier, with 7x being chosen if you have lit\nEB from bonus multipliers on the current ball).  He'll also throw in 15M for\nreaching the city.\n\nIf you have no souvenirs when you reach this city, after the opening\nanimation, the screen will dissolve into the text: \"You have no souvenirs to\nsell\".  You still get the 15M mode bonus when this happens.\n\nOn P-x ROMs, the multiplier will be between 1.5x and 3.5x, chosen\nrandomly.\n\nIf you start this mode by hitting the Start City Scene scoop, you are\nawarded 75 miles towards the next city before the ball is kicked back into\nplay.\n\n Denver (Gold Rush) \nThis mode is kinda dull.  Just keep shooting the Left Ramp.  The Ramp\nscores 5M the first time, 10M the second, 15M the third, and 20M afterwards.\nThe ball is always fed to the Inside Right Inlane, so if you hit a few shots\nin a row you'll boost your bonus multiplier as well.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards the next two shot values (once only).\n\nStart quote:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, GOLD!\"\n\n\n Butte (Tunnel Hunt) \nShoot the underground shots (Lock, Start City Scene scoop, Blast Hole).\nThe first one is worth 10M, the next 12M, and the last 20M.  You can get only\none award from each shot.\n\nThis mode is easy if you can catch balls coming out of the Start City\nScene scoop.  Catch the ball at the start of the mode and shoot it back into\nthe Scoop.  Then catch again and shoot the Lock.  Then let the ball hit the\nMagic Standup to collect the third award.\n\nThe Magic Standup spots one of the Underground shots (if you haven't hit\nthe Blast Hole yet, that shot is always spotted first).\n\nNone of the shots has a light to indicate whether it's been hit; you have\nto check the DMD.  There are three mounds of dirt.  The left mound corresponds\nto the Lock, the center mound to the Start City Scene scoop, and the right\nmound to the Blast Hole.  When you shoot one of the shots, the bulldozer\ncarries off the corresponding mound of dirt.\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"What are they digging for here?\"\n Ted: \"Let's dig in, darlin'!\"\n Red: \"Well, start diggin'.\"\n Ted: \"I'm tryin'!\"\n\n\nHitting one of the tunnels gives:\n\n Red: \"Ya got one!  Nice shot.\"\n Red: \"Ya got one!  Way to go.\"\n Red: \"Ya got one!  Outstanding!\"\n Red: \"Ya got one!  Big points.\"\n Red: \"Ya got one!  Nice shootin' partner.\"\n\n\n Las Vegas (Slot Machine) \nThis is a 15 second mode.  The Wheel will be constantly spinning.  Every\nshot to the Lock awards the currently lit award.  You can receive any award,\neven ones that you're already collected on the current Wheel during normal\nplay.\n\nLas Vegas is a great mode to rack up EBs, since if you have the ball\ntrapped on the right flipper (and you know just when to shoot), you can pretty\nmuch pick the award you get from the Wheel.  On the machine that Mike plays,\nshooting the ball when the spinning light is on \"Lite Special\" almost always\nresults in an EB award.  And the light is on EB again when the ball hits the\nMagic Standup.\n\nIt is possible that Bad Weather is disabled during Las Vegas (rumor\nalert!).\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards the currently lit award (once only).\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, slot machines\"\n Ted: \"There goes Friday's paycheck.\"\n\n\nDuring the mode, you may hear:\n\n Red: \"Hit something!\"\n Red: \"Hey, that works.\"\n Ted: \"The biggest bang for your buck, baby.\"\n\n\n Salt Lake City (Old West) \nThe taxi cab is back again!  The cabbie and the bulldozer are in a\nshowdown.  Hit the Bulldozer Blade and the bulldozer will crush the cab when\nthey meet, and you'll get 60M.  If you don't hit the Blade within about 5\nseconds, you'll lose the showdown and get only 25M.\n\nHitting the Magic Standup awards 60M.\n\nStart quotes:\n\n <western music>\n Cabbie: \"I have returned for you, mister bulldozer man!\"\n\n\nIf you win:\n\n Cabbie (in his crushed cab): \"Oh, I hate when this happens!\"\n\n\n Seattle (Alien Invasion) \nThis is the first of the West Coast modes.  The aliens from TZ have\nlanded!  Repel the aliens by hitting the Ramps.\n\nThe mode lasts 20 seconds.  Each target is worth 1.5M(!).  Hitting a Ramp\nawards 14M and raises the target value by 500K, to a max of 5M.\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, aliens!\"\n Ted: \"I think they LIKE ya, Red.\"\n Red: \"Oh, Ted...\"\n\n\n San Francisco (Monster Attack) \nGodzilla is attacking the city in this mode.  Hit him with the bulldozer\nby hitting the Bulldozer Blade.  All targets start at 1.5M.  The Blade awards\n10M and increases the target value by 500K, to a max of 5M.\n\nStart quote:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, monsters!\"\n\n\n Los Angeles (Earthshaker) \nThe shaker motor really gets a workout in this mode.  Ted and Red have\nstumbled upon some new roads.  Smash the road by hitting the Blast Targets.\nAll targets start at 1.5M.  Hitting the Blast Targets awards 10M and raises the\nfrenzy value by 500K, to a max of 5M.\n\nStarting quotes:\n\n Red: \"Hey look Ted, new road.\"\n Ted: \"We'll fix that!\"\n\n\nHitting the Blast Targets gives:\n\n Red: \"Earrrthshaaakerrr!\" (mimicking the quote from the Earthshaker pin)\n\n\nTo complete the entire map, you must travel to the West Coast at least\nthree times.  Nothing much happens when you start your last unlit city; the\nmode runs like normal.  When that mode ends, the entire map will be lit (with\nthe next city flashing as usual).  When you start that city, instead of the\nusual opening animation, the DMD says \"WOW\" in a medium-sized font.  When that\ncity finishes, the entire grid will be turned off (except for the just-finished\ncity), and the next city will flash.\n<11> Super Payday (Wizard Bonus)\nDuring any West Coast city scene, you can start Super Payday.  During the\nmode, lock one ball in Bob's Bunker, and then lock another ball in either the\nBunker, the Start City Scene Scoop, or the Blast/Wheel Hole (this includes\nhitting the Skill Shot after locking ball 1).  In addition to a great animation\nof the Earth blowing up, look at all the valuable prizes you get for doing\nthis:\n\n\n    Special is lit: lights the outlane Specials;\n    Jets at max: The Bumpers score 1M each;\n    All targets score;\n    3x Blast lit: All Blasts you collect score 3x the blast value;\n    Shoot the Wheel: Each shot to the Lock or Blast Hole gives a Wheel award;\n    Ramps score Payday Bonus.\n\n\nOn LA-5, the third award in that list is \"All targets score <some random\nvalue>\".  That value can be as high as 22M!  While it'd be nice to have all\ntargets scoring 22M, we don't really believe it. :)\n\nThe Payday Bonus is an enigmatic thing.  You can collect it from the Loops\nas well as the Ramps.  When you collect a Payday Bonus, Red announces one of\nthe cities (in order from east to west) that you visited on the way to the West\nCoast.  The city name is also displayed in the DMD.  Then, some amount of\npoints is displayed (that's the bonus).\n\nThe Payday Bonus is the amount of points that you collected in the\nannounced city.  Sometimes, the DMD displays \"0,000,000\" - this is probably a\nbug, since it's impossible to get zero points in a mode.  Another bug can\nresult in all Payday bonuses being worth anywhere from 1M to 153M(!).\n\nHitting the Magic Standup during Super Payday makes strange things happen.\nIt awards your next Payday Bonus, but instead of displaying the next city\nname, the DMD says \"Houlton.\"  Red still says the correct name, though.\n\"Houlton\" is often displayed the next few times as well.\n\nHoulton may also be the first city displayed.  When this happens, Houlton\noften appears a few more times, and red says \"New York City\" each time.\n\nWhen you collect a Payday Bonus, both characters scream.  The Blade\nconstantly rises and lowers throughout the mode, although hitting Ted or\ngetting a ball into his mouth doesn't do anything.\n\nNow, if you've been reading carefully, you know that there are four balls\nin Road Show.  You're at the start of Super Payday.  You have two balls locked,\nand one at the plunger.  Why is the fourth ball going to waste?  Well, in fact\nit doesn't - it just takes a bit of effort to get it into play.  Here are the\npossible situations at the start of Super Payday, and the number of balls you\nget:\n\n\n  1 ball in the Lock, 1 in the Blast Hole or Start City Scene Scoop.  1 ball\nis served to the plunger for 3-ball SPD.\n  2 balls in the Lock, 1 ball in the Hole or the Scoop.  1 ball is served to\nthe plunger for 4-ball SPD.\n  2 balls in the Lock, 0 balls in the Hole or the Scoop.  1 ball is served to\nthe plunger.  Hit the Skill Shot for 4-ball SPD.  If you miss, you get\n3-ball SPD.\n  3 balls in the Lock, 0 balls in the Hole or the Scoop.  1 ball is kicked out\nof the Lock and you play SPD with one ball for a few seconds.  If you get\nthat ball into the Blast Hole or Start City Scene Scoop before either of the\ntwo remaining balls is kicked out, another ball is served to the Plunger for\n4-ball SPD.\n\n\nRemember, you must use that extra ball only for good, and never for evil.\n\nIf the West Coast mode's timer is under 10 seconds when you lock the first\nball, it is reset to 10 when the second ball is served to the plunger.\n\nIf you lock one ball during the West Coast mode, but the timer runs out\nbefore you lock the other ball, the first ball is kicked out, and the West\nCoast mode continues until you drain one ball (maybe -- the locked ball is not\nalways kicked out).\n\nIf you lock one ball, then drain the other ball, the first ball is kicked\nout and the mode ends.\n\nOnce, Mike locked one ball, drained the other, and the ball ended!  But\nhe hasn't been able to reproduce this.\n\nAfter Super Payday ends, the jets will still be worth 1M, the Special will\nbe lit if you didn't collect it during SPD, and the Wheel will be lit.\n<12> The Magic Standup (tm)\nThe Magic Standup is the backwards-facing target below the tip of the\nUpper Left Flipper.  The easiest way to hit it is not to flip at balls coming\nout of the Lock.  The ball should roll right into the target.  In fact, in\norder to benefit from the powers of the Magic Standup, that's exactly how you\nhave to hit it.\n\nThis standup does lots of good things:\n\n Hitting the target at any time lights the Blast Targets if they're not\nalready lit.  (In this case, the target does not have to be hit by a ball\ncoming out of the Lock.)\n In New York, it awards one hit on the Bulldozer.\n In Miami, it raises the target value by 300K.\n In Atlanta, it adds 16M to the hurry-up value.\n In Ohio, it spots one of the Ramps.\n In New Orleans, it counts as two Ramp/Loop shots.\n In Nashville, it awards a Radio Targets shot.\n In Chicago, it blows up a toll booth.\n In Dallas, it counts as two Ramp/Loop shots.\n In Kansas City, it awards the hurry-up value (usually 25M).\n In Minneapolis, it unfreezes 2 people.\n In Denver, it counts as two Left Ramp hits.\n In Butte, it spots one of the underground shots.\n In Las Vegas, it awards a Wheel award.\n In Salt Lake City, it awards 60M.\n During Super Payday, it brings up the \"Houlton\" bug.\n\n\nNote that, during modes, the Magic Standup only gives its special award\nonce.  After that, it behaves like the other standups.\n<13> Combos\nCombos are unfortunately few in number.\n\nBanking a ball off the three-bank of Radio Targets and into the Blade\nscores 5M.\n\nShooting Left Loop -> Blast Targets awards 2x the Blast Value.\n\nShooting Right Ramp (with Bridge Out lit) -> Blast Targets awards 3x the\nBlast Value.\n\nDuring the Atlanta mode, shooting Left Loop -> Blast Targets awards 2x the\nhurry up value (see bugs).\n\nDuring Atlanta, shooting Right Ramp (with Bridge Out lit) -> Blast Targets\nawards 3x the hurry up value.\n\nOne sequence that is particularly valuable is Left Ramp -> Left Ramp\n(Bridge Out) -> Right Ramp (Bridge Out) -> Blast Hole.  This awards: two bonus\nmultipliers, a Super Blast, a Wheel award, and starts the next mode.  Not to\nmention that it feels great and impresses any onlookers.\n<14> Easter Eggs\nThere are two DOHOs.  One is in the backglass artwork (look at the barbed\nwire on the far right side of the picture).  The other is in the background of\nthe New York mode display.  One of the buildings has the letters in its\nwindows, like this:\n\n\n D  O \n H  O \n\n\nThere are also two cows.  The Picture Plate souvenir has a picture of a\ncow on it.  The other cow is on the backglass, on the far right, standing at\nthe top of the hill.\n\nIn the tradition of Pat Lawlor pinballs, someone is drawn on the backglass\nholding a red thumb-trigger button in their left hand.  This time, it's Pat\nhimself, sitting in a Corvette (with the license plate GAME BIZ) on the Road\nbehind the bulldozer.  He honestly looks happy at all the mayhem surrounding\nhim.\n\nConstruction Mania - see the Souvenirs section.\n\nThe \"Secret video mode\" display sometimes seen in the window of Bob's\nshop.  It's probably just a joke, but ya never know.\n\nDuring the attract mode, sometimes the high scores will all have the\ninitials \"RED\".\n<15> Bugs\nIn Atlanta, if you collect a doubled or tripled hurry-up award, the light\nin front of the Blast Targets will continue to flash until you collect another\nblast or the ball ends.  (This is present in LA-3, 4, and 5.)\n\n[This is Mike's bug]  I had Big Blast lit during Atlanta.  I shot Left\nLoop -> Blast Hole.  Things got really confused, as I was awarded 5x the Blast\nValue, 1x the hurry up value, and Red said \"You missed everything!\"\n\nDuring New Orleans, after you collect a 20M award, the \"next shot =\"\ndisplay will say \"52M\".  This is just a display bug.\n\nThe whole \"Houlton\" deal.  This was present in the prototype ROMs, it\ndidn't seem to be in LA-3, but in LA-4 it's BACK!\n\nIf you light Bridge Out on either Ramp, then hit the Ramp right after\nBridge Out times out, the ball will still be diverted.\n\nSometimes, Red will say \"Spin the Wheel!\", and the DMD will display \"Wheel\nis lit\" when your multiplier was at max (which means that the Wheel was NOT\nrelit).  This has been fixed in LA-5.\n\nSometimes after collecting a Wheel award, the Wheel lights will not be\nupdated, so the award you just collected will remain flashing.  The Wheel IS\nupdated internally, but this bug can be annoying.  This bug is in LA-4, but was\nnot in LA-3.\n\nIf you have Flying Rocks lit at the Left Ramp, and you start any Multiball\nmode, the top-left diverter on the Left Ramp will always activate during the\nMultiball.  (The lower two diverters won't activate, though.)  (This is present\non LA-4 and 5.)\n\nIf you collect Hold Bonus on a ball during which you also light EB from\nthe multipliers, on the next ball your multiplier will be displayed as \"XX\".\nThis would be a clever way to show a 10x multiplier, but that isn't the case -\nit's still just 6x.  (This is present in LA-3, 4, and 5.)\n\n[This is Scott's bug]  If you collect a You're There award during a West\nCoast mode between locks, and then start Super Payday, the New York mode will\nrun simultaneously with Super Payday.  Also, when you collect a Payday Bonus,\nthe announced city will always be New York.\n\nIn Kansas City, when you collect a hurry-up award, you cannot collect\nanother until the animation for the award finishes.\n\n[This is Mike's bug]  If you have EB and/or the Wheel lit, and Restart\nMultiball lit at the Lock, the restart timer continues to run during the EB and\nWheel animations.  If the timer runs out during the animation, another ball\nwill be served to the plunger, but Multiball will NOT restart.\n\nIn San Francisco, if you lock one ball, but the timer runs out before you\nlock the second ball, the San Francisco mode continues until you drain that\nball.  You cannot start Super Payday with that ball, however.  (This seems to\nhappen sometimes in the other West Coast modes, too.)\n\n[This is Mike's bug]  If you collect 2 Bob's Freebie awards at the same\ntime (or about the same time), the second souvenir-selection animation will\noverride the first, but only the first souvenir will be displayed.  (This is\njust a display bug as far as I can tell.)\n\n[This is Scott's bug]  If you collect Bob's Freebie and start Construction\nMania during a mode which ends after you hit certain shots (such as Ohio),\nConstruction Mania will end when the mode ends, regardless of the time left on\nthe Construction Mania timer.\n\n[This is Scott's bug]  Starting Construction Mania or Bad Weather during a\nmode which is a hit-all-you-can mode (like New York or New Orleans) will freeze\nthe mode timer until Construction Mania or Bad Weather ends.\n\nWhen you hit a Skill Shot at the start of a ball, the ball saver timer\nfreezes, but the timer on the light continues to run.  That means that the\nsaver will be active when the ball is kicked out even thought the light will\nhave turned off.\n<16> Miscellaneous Stuff\nExtra balls and Specials remain lit across balls until they are collected.\nExtra balls may be stacked, but Specials cannot.  If a Special is already lit,\nand you collect another Light Special award, the second award is lost.  One\noutlane is lit for Special at a time, and it alternates Outlanes with each\nSlingshot hit.\n\nThe three flippers on the left side are independently controllable to some\nextent.  Pushing the left flipper button partway in activates the Lower Left\nFlipper, and pushing it in fully activates the other two flippers at the same\ntime.\n\nGetting a ball into Red's mouth awards 20M, and a quote:\n\n\n \"Oh my!  That's terrible!\"  or\n \"Bleah!  How can you eat those things?\"\n\nThe quote changes after the first multiball (because Red saw Ted eat the\nball to start multiball).  Clever!\n\nYou can buy-in until you reach the West Coast, for 1/2 credit each time.\nYou don't get anything special for buying in.\n\nThere are two high score lists.  One is the all-time high scores, which\nincludes the Grand Champion and the #1 through #4 scores.  There is also a\ndaily high score board, which holds the four highest scores of the day.  This\nlist resets every day at midnight.  No credits are awarded for making the daily\nhigh score board.\n\nThe match sequence is pretty dull.  It's similar to TNG's, except without\nthe stars and Trek music.  The Match is disabled by default.\n\nMiscellaneous quotes:\n\nHitting the shooter bypass - Red: \"Big points!\" or \"Nice shot!\"\n\nHaving over 100M at Fun With Bonus - Red: \"Big Points!\"\n\nTilting - Red: \"Oh no...\"  Ted: \"Now THAT'S pinball.\"\n\nWhen you buy in - Ted: \"There goes Friday's paycheck.\"\n\nAt the start of the game - Red: \"Let's rip some road!\", or Red: \"Time to go to\nwork!  Let's fire that thing up!\", then Ted: \"*yawn* huh?\"\n\nAt the end of the game - Red: \"Don't be a stranger.\"\n<17> Operator Adjustments\nHere is the list of adjustments.  This info is all straight out of the\nRoad Show manual.  That means that it's copyrighted by Williams and you'll\nlikely get in trouble if you try to sell it.

So, now you're in a\npredicament.\n\nYou have two choices.  If your machine's tilt is lenient, raise the\nflipper and give the machine a nudge forward (a little stronger than your\nnormal up-push).  The ball will roll up and be in range of the flipper.   Bat\nit away and continue playing.\n\nThe other method is a bit more tricky.  Again, raise the flipper.  Just as\nthe ball turns right and heads for the Outlane, slap the right side of the\ncabinet.  If you do it right, the ball will hit the top of the Inlane/Outlane\ndivider, bounce off the movable post to the left of the Outlane, and bounce\nback to the Inlane.\n\n Extra balls \nEBs are not that hard to come by.  If you're close to getting an EB from\nBlasts, keep shooting Left Loop -> Blast Hole or Targets to rack up Blasts.  If\nLite EB is the flashing Wheel award, go for Right Ramp (Bridge Out) -> Blast\nHole or Left Loop -> Blast Hole.\n\n Big points \nThe Ramps are the best place to shoot.  By themselves, they don't award\nmuch, but they light many other shots which DO give good awards.  On their own,\nthe Ramps score miles which lead to modes, and collect awards in some modes.\n\nCollecting the Bridge Out awards increases your Bonus Multiplier towards\nan extra ball, and lights the Wheel (usually) which leads to more awards.  And\nif you don't have a Bridge Out lit, just shoot a Ramp to light one!\n\nBonus multipliers become even more important near the end of a big game.\nYou'll have lots of cities, lots of miles, and lots of Blasts.  Building up\nyour multiplier each ball should be a high priority.  Mike once collected a\n799M Fun With Bonus with a 6x multiplier!\n\nAfter you have many cities lit, go for souvenirs as often as possible.\nThis means let balls drain if the ball saver is on, to have another chance at\nthe Skill Shot and another souvenir.  Combine all those souvenirs with 6x\nmultipliers for mega-bonuses.  (Remember, the 10M bonus per souvenir per city\nat Fun With Bonus is multiplied by your bonus multiplier.)\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic@niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Road Show", "possible_shots": "Left Inlane, Left Outlane, Rocks Plunger, Middle Left Flipper, Left Loop, Upper Left Flipper, The Magic Standup, Spinner Lane and Bob's Souvenir Bunker, Left Ramp, Bulldozer Blade, Ted, Center Loop, Red, Radio Targets, Jet Bumpers, Right Ramp, Plastic Radio, Start City Scene, Blast/Wheel Hole, Blast Targets, Skill Shot Lane, Plunger, Right Inlanes, Right Outlane, Slingshots, Lower Flippers, Standups", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/roadshow.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Road Show", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

You've gotta react fast and make the right shots at the right time. It's a drop-target game: 10 of the 11 are numbered and represent the 10 rounds of a title fight. Win rounds by shooting the drop-targets that match the round you're in - if you don't, the game drops the target remotely and you lose the round! The rounds are \"timed\" by the number of switch closures. Keep your guard up, especially with those jabbing slingshots in front of you and like it says at the exit of the shooter lane, \"Answer the bell!\"\n\nPLAYFIELD FEATURES\n\nLEFT DROP TARGETS (3) - ROUNDS 3, 6 & 9\n\nLocation: Centre left of playfield\nScoring: 1000 if target is not the current round being fought; 10'000 if target is the current round being fought and wins round\nExtra: Completing bank resets bank and adds Bonus\n\n\nTOP DROP TARGETS (5) - ROUNDS 1, 4, 7 & 10 and ROCKY\n\nLocation: Top right of playfield\nScoring: 1000 if target is not the current round being fought; 10'000 if target is the current round being fought and wins round\nExtra: Completing bank resets bank and adds Bonus.

In 5-ball play, the left lane arrow advances 1 step for each 2 rounds won after the first won. 7 rounds with 1 ball lights the top hole for Special. Once Special is lit, shooting the top hole will award Special.\n\nINSTANT WIN - Using the green button on the left side of the cabinet instantly wins the round but only 2 Instant Wins are allowed per game. Winning a round by means of Instant Win (or a lit Outlane) will re-establish a previously lost round drop-target. Instant Wins and Instant Wins Remaining are remembered from ball-to-ball.\n\nBONUS & MULTIPLIER: The maximum Bonus is 19'000. If 2, 3 or 4 rounds are won the Multiplier value is 2x, increasing to 5x if 5, 6 or 7 rounds are won and 10x if 8 rounds or more are won.\n\nFLIPPERS (5) - The flipper positioning is unusual: There are a pair of flippers at the bottom of both the left and right sides of the playfield, plus 1 flipper in the upper centre of the playfield shooting top right to the 5 drop-target bank. The right flipper button rotates the lit pop-bumpers, the lit top rollover lanes and alternates the lit outlane rollovers.\n\nSTATUS DISPLAY - The display in the card-holder shows the number of rounds won on the left side and the current round being fought on the right side.\n\n\nLast updated: 10.June 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Rocky", "possible_shots": "LEFT DROP TARGETS, TOP DROP TARGETS, RIGHT DROP TARGETS, RED SPOT TARGET, SPINNING \"UPPER CUT\" TARGET, POP BUMPERS, TOP ROLLOVERS, \"ON THE ROPES\" BALL SHOOTER, LEFT & RIGHT OUTLANES, LEFT & RIGHT INLANES, HOLE, 10 POINT SWITCHES, EXTRA BALL, SPECIAL, INSTANT WIN, BONUS & MULTIPLIER, FLIPPERS, STATUS DISPLAY", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/rocky.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Rocky", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

However, since it is a licensed theme, most of the stuff is\nundoubtedly copyrighted by some Higher Authority.\nImportant Things\nThis section describes key elements and/or shots to be made in Rocky &\nBullwinkle.  They will be constantly referred to in the play discussion.\n\n\nAbbreviations  K = 1000; M = 1,000,000; B = 1,000,000,000; R&B = Rocky &\nBullwinkle; DE = Data East; SDTM = straight down the middle.\nBonus-X lanes  The 3 lanes at the top of the playfield.  Completing all 3\nincreases your bonus multiplier (2X-4X-6X-8X-10X-Bonus\nhold).  You can steer the lights with the flippers.  These\nlanes are also used for the skill shot, described below.  I\nam not sure of the award after bonus hold.\nPop bumpers  There are 3 just under the bonus-x lanes.  They are not worth\nmuch unless you have Super Pops going.\nCenter shot  This is the little opening in the middle of the playfield,\nbetween the O and M BOMB targets.  Shoot it to light the WABAC\nvalue on the left ramp, to collect (super) mystery select, and\nto complete the puzzle.  Note there is a hole on the top side\nof the center shot, where the ball usually comes down after\nleaving the upper pop bumper area, though often it will shoot\nfrom the bottommost pop bumper right into the hole at the end\nof the center shot.\nLeft ramp  This is the big R ramp on the left.  You can easily hit it from\nthe right flipper, and usually from the left flipper as well.\nThe WABAC Machine value is collected from the left ramp.  During\nTri-Ball, this ramp increases the jackpot by 1M.  Weak shots may\ntend to drain, depending on your machine.\nRight ramp  This ramp features a steep entrance, a left-flipper only shot,\nand a highly annoying U-turn at the peak.  Half-shots usually\ndon't end in a drain, thankfully.\nBOMB targets  These are 4 stand-up targets with 1 on either side of a ramp\nentrance.  It seems that on some machines they're fairly easy\nto hit, and some they require dead-on shots.  Some may also\nneed to be hit fairly hard to register.\nPie  This is the big wheel near the U-turn of the right ramp.  There are 12\nlights to complete (3 for each BOMB letter).  Completing the Pie\nlights the right ramp to start Tri-Ball.  Completing the Pie during\nTri-Ball lights the right ramp for the 100M Super Jackpot!  It also\ncircles around during Spin-n-Win showing you the value that you'll get\nwhen you hit the ramp.\nAesop & Son  This is the kickout on the extreme left side.  Any shot into\nthis hole or the center shot will clear another puzzle piece\nand kick the ball back out, often to the right flipper.\nHowever, it is pretty unreliable, sometimes kicking very\nsoftly to the LEFT flipper, and sometimes SDTM.  I would\nforget about trying to catch it on a regular basis, though.\nYou can light this shot for the extra ball via the Mystery\nSelect.  It's not that hard to shoot.  (The one time I lit it,\nI took one shot at it and made it.)\nRhino shot  This is the right orbit shot, starting to the right of the\nright ramp and looping all the way around the back, eventually\nback to the flippers.  Which flipper it heads towards is fairly\nrandom.  It SHOULD go to the left flipper for repeated orbit\nshots.  You can light the special via the Mystery Select, then\nshoot the Rhino for the special.  (There is a big red arrow\nindicating the special.)\nLeft orbit  This is the shot opposite of the Rhino (right orbit) shot.\nWhen the Hat Trick is lit, though, the gate should trigger the\ndiverter and the ball will go into the Hat Trick hole, instead.\nIf the diverter is broken, newer ROMs compensate and award you\nthe Hat Trick if you make the left orbit shot.\nHats  These are 3 touch targets just above the Aesop & Son kickout.  Each\none has a different character on it, representing each of the 3\npossible animals Bullwinkle can pull out of his hat.  Hitting all 3\nlights the Hat Trick.  Hitting all 3 during Tri-Ball relaunches the\n3rd ball if one drained!\nHat Trick  This shot is lit during Tri-Ball and after hitting all 3 hats.\nDuring Tri-Ball, the first shot lights the jackpot, and the 2nd\nlights the double jackpot for about 8 seconds.  Hitting it again\nbefore a jackpot is collected will relight the double for 8\nseconds (non-cumulative; it just restarts the timer).  Getting\nit after the hats results in Bullwinkle pulling an animal out of\nhis hat, and you getting or lighting an award based on the\nanimal.  (Discussed in more detail below.)  With the diverter\nworking, this shot feeds back to the left flipper for a shot at\nanything it may light.\nSaved  These are the 5 drop targets on the middle right side of the\nplayfield.  Knocking all of them down lights Save Nell, where you\nhit 1 (or more) targets for 25M within 15 seconds.\nSELECT  These are the daisy letter lights in the middle of the playfield.\n(They're kinda hard to miss.  %) )  Shoot the Rhino and left orbit\nshots to spot letters.  Lighting all letters lights the Mystery\nSelect in the center shot.  However, you can KEEP shooting orbits,\nand get every letter flashing.  When SELECT is flashing, the SUPER\nMystery Select is lit.  (Supposedly, these are just better awards.)\nLaser Kick  This is a kickback in the left outlane.  Of course, there's a\nnice big hole to go with it, so the ball has plenty of room to\npass through it easily.  It can be worth 1M, 3M, 5M, or Adv.\nBonus-X.  The value is changed by the return lanes and the\nright outlane.  Steer the \"Advance Laser Kick\" lights with the\nflippers.  If the ball passes over a switch while it's lit,\nthe Laser Kick value goes up to the next one (starts each ball\nlit at 1M unless by some miracle (or even worse luck) you\nDIDN'T use it up last ball, in which case it stays lit at\nwhatever it was before).  It will wrap around from Adv-X to\n1M.\n\nThe Skill Shot\nWell, on a normal machine, this shot just doesn't require very much skill at\nall.  The auto-plunger can be pretty flaky, though, and for some reason it\nwill would sometimes just go around the Rhino loop, not stopping at the top\nlanes, or brick off the left side gate and come back down the right side.\nUsually a little nudging will keep the ball in the upper area.\n\nIf the ball comes down the left side again, and doesn't hit ANYTHING else,\nyou can let it go and the game will give you another crack at the skill shot,\nforever (or until you finally DO hit something else).\n\nNow, for the skill shot, all you have to do is make sure the ball goes into\nthe flashing lane, which you steer with your flippers.  On a lot of\nmachines, it always goes down the left lane (lite select).  At any rate,\nyou'll see that each lane has its own award.  If the ball goes down the lit\nlane, then your award is whatever was shown at the top there.\n\nThe awards are usually:\n\n\nLeft lane  Lite Select.  If the Mystery Select was already lit, then this\naward will light the Super Mystery Select.  If the Super Mystery Select\nwas already lit, then this award will be a measly 5M.\n\nMiddle lane  Super Pops.  However, if this award is already lit, then this\nlane will change to something different, usually \"lite looping,\" which is\nthe same as the WABAC award.  If both of these are lit, the lane changes\nto Rocket Squirrel Scoring.  See the puzzles for explanation.\n\nRight lane  About 4M + 1M * the ball number.  Oh boy.\n\n\nPersonally, I'd PREFER it always went down the lite select lane...\nThe WABAC Machine\nAs stated, the WABAC is the left ramp.  If there is a value flashing under\nthe entrance, then you may shoot the ramp for that value.  Otherwise, the\ncenter shot should be lit to light the WABAC.\n\nThere seems to be no way to change the WABAC value.  Whatever the machine\npicks next, you're stuck with it.\n\n[BTW - That's Way-Back if you haven't figured it out yet!  :) ]\n\nOnce you get a WABAC value, you won't be able to get it again until you've\ncompleted the WABAC ramp mode.  Note that if you get a WABAC award from\nsomething else (like the skill shot or mystery select), then it'll be lit\non the WABAC indicating you've already gotten it.\n\nThere are 8 different WABAC awards that can be gotten.  In the order which\nthey appear on the game, they are:\n\n\nSuper Pops  Lights the 3 pop bumpers just under the bonus-x lanes for high\nscoring.  The first 10 (or so) hits score 500K, the next 10 hits score\n1M, and then the next hits score 2M.  I do not believe it goes higher\nthan 2M, though.  The game will flash \"Super Pops Ready\" over the score\ndisplay at various times when Super Pops is lit.  Once ONE single bumper\nhas been hit, the sequence lasts for as long as the ball stays up in the\njets.  After a certain period of time, the bumpers will go back to\nregular value.  The slingshots will also score the current Super Pops\nvalue after it has been started.  It will stay lit until you hit a jet\nbumper.\n\n???  A random award.  Usually it'll give a mystery score (of either 5M,\n10M, 15M, or 20M), but it sometimes gives other things like light or\naward extra ball, light special, light mystery select, etc.  It even\ndoubled my score once...\n\nBomb Millions  This award is pretty simple:  You get 1M for each light you\ncurrently have lit on the Pie.  This does NOT include the currently\nflashing light(s).  But here's the nice thing:  If you have under 4\nlights lit on the Pie, it will AUGMENT your current Tri-Ball lighting\nprogress to 4 lights.  So if you've just had a Tri-Ball, scoring Bomb\nMillions spots your first 4 targets towards the next Tri-Ball.  Note that\nthis can be worth up to 12M (if Tri-Ball is lit).\n\nLooping  A timed award that starts when you shoot a ramp.  When you do, you\nhave 20 seconds to keep shooting ramps for millions of points.  If you\nshot the right ramp IMMEDIATELY after getting \"Looping\", then your next\nramp is worth 3M points; otherwise, the next ramp is worth 2M.  In either\ncase, as soon as you start it, you get 5M points.  The total you have\nearned in Looping mode is showed at the bottom of the display, but you\nare awarded the points as you go along.  As long as you keep shooting\nramps, you'll have at least 3-4 seconds to shoot the next one (the timer\nis reset to that if you shoot a ramp before the mode ends).  If you shoot\nthe ramp opposite the one the ball just left, the value for the next ramp\nwill increase by 1M.  If you take too long or shoot it up the SAME ramp\nyou last shot, then the next ramp value stays the same.  [See also RAMP\nLOOPING in Misc. Scoring.]\n\nLoose Moose  A frenzy round, with every switch worth 500K.  Note that at\nleast the ramp gates on R&B swing a lot, so half-shooting the ramps is a\ngreat way to increase your Loose Moose score.  This value IS awarded as\npart of your end-of-ball bonus.  So DON'T TILT!\n\nInstant TriBall  Amazingly enough, starts Tri-Ball (c) (r) TM.\n\nLite Mystery  Lights the Mystery Select award in the center shot.  (Or the\nSuper Mystery Select if Mystery Select was already lit.)\n\n10 Mil.  YOU figure it out...\n\n\nAfter all 8 awards are earned, the left ramp is lit for Back in Time.  Shoot\nthe ramp to start it.  Then, for 15 seconds, every shot up the ramp takes\nyou back 100 years.  If you make a ramp shot and have less than 4 seconds\nremaining, the timer is reset to 4 seconds.  Thus, you could shoot this shot\nall day if you never missed.  (Ha!)\n\nYou do get some amount of points for shooting the WABAC during this time.\nNot sure exactly how many, though.  It has been reported that getting to 993\nawards 50M.  I haven't done this yet, so I don't know for sure.\nThe Puzzle\nShooting the center shot or Aesop & Son during regular play takes away\nanother piece of the puzzle.  Behind all the puzzle pieces is the first\nframe of an animation, which is the introduction to a point-scoring sequence\nof some kind.  The first puzzle has 3 pieces blocking it, and every\ncompleted puzzle increases the initial number of pieces by one, up to the\nmaximum of 6 pieces, where the picture is completely covered.\n\nSo you clear the last piece, then the animation starts (some are OK, some\nwill get old real quick), then the ball gets kicked out, then you are told\nwhat you are supposed to do.  That's why it's very important that you know\nwhat you are shooting for and what will happen when the puzzle round starts,\nbecause you won't have a chance to see it during play!  Pretty poor planning\non DE's part, IMHO, but that's only one small problem, and there aren't that\nmany in R&B compared to older games.\n\nIf you get tired of watching the animations over and over again, you can\nabort them by hitting the launch button (it's blinking).  Thank God!\n\nAnyway, here are the various rounds that I know of, with a description of\ntheir first pictures (I won't describe the animations; I'll let you see them\nyourself):\n\n\nRocket Squirrel Scoring  The first picture has R&B sitting on top of a\nrocket with Rocky holding a map.  On the right are Boris and Natasha\ngetting ready to light the rocket.  The goal of this round is to shoot\norbits, holes, and ramps.  Each one you hit is worth 5M and it lasts for\n20 seconds.  There is no timer restart on this round.  The total is shown\non the bottom for the round, but you get the points as you go.\n\nSpin-n-Win  The first frame shows Bullwinkle on the left side of the screen\nand a steam roller on the right side.  This round lasts for 20 seconds as\nwell.  The goal is to keep hitting the right ramp.  The Pie will keep\nchanging, and the color that is lit at the time you hit the switch is the\nvalue you get (it's either 5M, 15M, 10M, or 20M, in that order).  The\nramp diverter will NOT divert the ball this round, enabling you to keep\nshooting the right ramp over and over.  Hitting it resets the timer to 4\nseconds for unlimited shots.  The total is displayed here too, but it is\nawarded as you go.  This round can actually be pretty lucrative if you\ncan keep hitting the ramp, esp. with an average value of 12.5M per ramp\nshot!\n\n2M Drops  This animation shows Snidely tying Nell up to railroad tracks.\nYou immediately start off with 10M points, and every drop target you hit\nduring this round scores 2M points.  It lasts for 20 seconds I think\n(maybe 15).  Again, the total is displayed at the top, but you get the\npoints right away.  Also, every time you hit the drop targets, they are\nimmediately reset, so you always have a shot at all 5 of them.  Makes\nit much easier to constantly take out 2-3 per hit.\n\nBack in Time  This animation shows Sherman and Peabody being growled at by\na dinosaur (or something).  The only thing it does is light the WABAC\nmachine for Back in Time right away, regardless of where you were on the\nWABAC awards.  You have 15 seconds to nail the left ramp, as described\nabove.  At the end of the round, the WABAC values are re-initialized\n(with one value blinking and the rest unlit).\n\nThe Hat Trick\nDuring non-Tri-Ball play, you hit the 3 hat targets just above the Aesop &\nSon entrance to light the Hat Trick.  Then, shooting the Lion shot should\ncause the diverter to open, and the ball will sit in the kickout hole while\nBullwinkle pulls something out of his hat.  (\"But that trick NEVER works!\")\nThe award you get depends on what comes up.  (\"I hafta get me another hat!\")\nYou can watch the backglass to see what he's pulling out.\n\nIf the Hat Trick is lit, completing the Hat targets again awards 5M points.\nThis does NOT go up at all.  Just another 5M.\n\nAs per my worst fears, the Hat Trick award seems to be totally random.  At\nleast, we couldn't see any pattern (and it doesn't have anything to do with\nthe first or last target you hit to light it, etc.).\n\nJust as a side note, you'll probably find Rocky saying \"Wrong hat!\" fairly\nannoying after a short period of time.  (He says it when you hit a Hat\ntarget that's already lit.)\n\nSo, just what ARE these stupid awards, you are wondering...  They are:\n\n\nLion  You get 15 seconds to shoot the right ramp for 15M points.  Decent.\n\nRhino  The Rhino shot starts with 20 seconds on the timer and at 20M\npoints.  As time goes on, the 20M starts counting down at 1M per second.\nYour first Rhino shot sets the value of it (and awards you those points).\nThe timer then IMMEDIATELY goes to 3 seconds for repeated shots at that\nsame value.  Every shot resets the timer to 3 seconds.  The value does\nNOT go below 3M.  When it hits 3M, it goes right to the Value= and Total=\ndisplay.  You are awarded the points right away, not at end-of-ball.\n\n\"Rabbit\"  The rabbit isn't a rabbit, just Rocky dressed up as one (look at\nthe Hat targets to see what he looks like).  At any rate, getting Rocky\nearns an extra ball.\n\nThe Mystery Select\nThe Mystery Select is lit by one of 3 ways:  The left lane skill shot, the\nWABAC machine, and by shooting loops.  Lighting it again (by one of those 3\nways) lights the Super Mystery Select.  Strangely enough, though, one of the\nMystery Select awards is \"Light Super Mystery Select\"!\n\nWhen lighting SELECT via the Rhino and left orbit shots, consecutive shots\nwill light 2 letters, as opposed to 1.  So if you started from scratch, 7\norbit shots would light the Super Mystery Select.  When lighting the (Super)\nMystery Select via the skill shot or WABAC, it will NOT award you 6 letters.\nRather, it will augment your current daisy count to light the next award.\nAn example would be if you had SELEC lit, then shot the WABAC for \"light\nmystery.\"  You would only get 1 letter for that.  Therefore, it would be a\nlot better to get that last daisy off the orbit shots before shooting for\nthe WABAC.\n\nShooting the center shot when SELECT is lit (or flashing) will give you the\n(Super) Mystery Select choice (\"I can't make up my mind!\").  It's pretty\nsimple:  You hit the flipper button corresponding to the side that the\nchoice you want is on.  Some choices are pretty close in value, but some far\nout-do the other one (5M or light extra ball???).\n\nSome typical awards are:\n\n\n Points\n Mystery Score (5M - 20M, or around double that for Super Mystery Select)\n Tri-Ball\n (Light) Extra ball (Shoot Aesop & Son if it's lit)\n (Light) Special (Shoot the Rhino shot if it's lit)\n Light Hat Trick\n Save Nell (described below in Misc. Scoring)\n Any of the puzzle rounds (WHY would you pick Back in Time??)\n Any of the WABAC machine awards (blocking it off on the WABAC) Double score(!)\n\n\nAnd probably some others I can't think of right now.  Usually, the Super\nMystery Select awards will be nicer than the normal ones.\n\nThe extra ball will stay lit if you don't get it that ball.  However, you\nMUST get the special on that ball, or it goes away.  Both of these may be\noperator adjustable, though.\n\nDouble score can be downright nice, sometimes, depending on the\ncircumstances.  For instance, at the PAPA 3 tournament, I doubled a 150M\nscore once!  It was during practice, though, but during a competition, that\ncan be pretty frustrating (to say the least) to competetors.\nMisc. Scoring\nThere are lots of little things that are worth points but just aren't worth\nmentioning (slingshots, etc.).  Most of the major scoring rounds have\nalready been described.  There are a couple more, along with a couple of\nundocumented features.\n\n\nSave Nell  Hitting all the drop targets on the right starts a 15 second\nround where all you have to do is hit a SINGLE drop target to score 25M.\n(\"Just in the nick of time!\")  Not bad.  The number of times you must\ncomplete the drop targets before the Save Nell round is started is\nindicated by the flashing number in front of the targets.  (If the \"2\" is\nflashing, you need to hit the bank 2 times to start the round.)  When you\nstart the round, the announcer will start commenting on the action (he\nsays \"Meanwhile\" and starts discussing Nell's predicament).  You should\nmiss it at least once in order to see the closing animation.  Snidely\nlaughs at you at says \"It's curtains.\"  The display goes back to Nell,\nand as the timer reaches 0, down comes the curtain.  :)  If you miss her,\nthen you only need to complete the bank once before re-lighting Save\nNell.  Otherwise, the number goes up by one for the next round.  WORTHY\nOF NOTE:  Getting Save Nell more than once IN THE SAME BALL seems to be\nworth many more points.  The second time scores 50M.  I don't know if it\nis unlimited or not, but if it keeps going up for awhile, you could get\n150M points by saving Nell 3 times on the same ball!\n\nRamp Looping  During normal play, ramp looping is always lit.  Basically,\nshooting one ramp, then sending the ball up the other one, etc. is\n\"looping.\"  You score 1M+1M each consecutive looping shot you make\nwithout missing.  (You can only touch the return lanes and the ramp gates\nand sensors.  If you take too long, you void the current looping as\nwell.)  There doesn't seem to be a limit (I've gotten it to 6M).  Though\nthis may be worth a decent amount of points eventually, there is a far\nmore important reason to go for looping ramps:  Starting with the 2M\nshot, every looping shot SPOTS ONE BOMB TARGET!  So getting it to 6M\nspotted 5 BOMB letters.  This can be invaluable as you get to the harder-\nto-light Tri-Ball rounds.  I also suppose the maximum award you could get\nwould be around 14M points, as the 15th shot would start Tri-Ball on the\nright ramp.  I don't think looping works during Tri-Ball.\n\nBonus  The end-of-ball bonus goes up as the ball goes on, and is multiplied\nby 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10.  The multiplier is advanced by the top lanes and by\nthe Adv. X award for the laser kick.  After getting 10X, the next bonus-X\nadvance will award bonus-hold, which holds the bonus AND the multiplier.\nThe maximum bonus, though, is only 2M (up to 20M when you have 10X), plus\nthe Loose Moose total if you had one that ball.  Fortunately, the rather\ntedious bonus counting can be aborted by hitting a flipper button (\"Thank\nyou Mr. Know-It-All!\" or \"Awww, Mr. PEAbody!\").\n\nVictory Lap  A typical DE award, which is lit after getting a replay from\nyour score.  Hit the right ramp for 25M bonus within around 15-20 seconds\nafter earning the replay.\n\nBomb extinguisher  Like the Star Wars shootout (and LW3 for that matter),\nthere is a time when you'll have to pound on the launch button about 5\ntimes for 5M points.  There's a brief siren-type noise before the round\nstarts, but you have to be paying pretty close attention to notice.\nAlso, the launch button starts blinking.  It seems to start after hitting\na number of UNLIT BOMB targets.\n\nCombo Shot  There is a 3-way combo in R&B.  I'm 95% sure that it is the\nRhino loop -> left orbit -> Aesop & Son.  It is worth 5M.\n\nNice Death Save?!?  You don't get any points for it, but this is the first\ngame in existence that recognizes a death save (getting the ball back in\nplay after an outlane drain) and CONGRATULATES you for doing it!.  This\nis totally cool.  :)  In fact, it now takes first place on my Way-Cool-\nThat-They-Even-Thought-To-Put-That-Into-A-Game list, just barely edging\nout \"Dirty pool\" in The Addam's Family.  Anyway, to see the animation,\nyou need to get the ball to hit another target after going down an\noutlane, but after the \"Danger\" animation goes away (if you got it).  If\nyou hit something after the danger sign goes away, you'll see the\nmessage, along with \"Good work Sherman\" and a very amusing animation with\nSherman and Peabody.  If you hit something too soon, you'll just hear\nsome bars of the Death March, which also play during the animation.  This\nis also supposedly worth some bwee amount of points (like 3-5M).  Not bad\nconsidering the programmer originally wanted to make it -10M.  :)\n\n\"Stay tuned, there's more!\"  You'll hear/see this if you lose the ball very\nsoon after launching.  There's no way to tell for sure if it's still lit\nor not, though.  You'll also get balls back that drain fairly soon after\nTri-Ball starts.\n\nTri-Ball\nTri-Ball can be started in a number of ways:  Getting it via Mystery Select,\nby completing the Pie by shooting BOMB or spotting it then shooting the\nright ramp, and it'll be lit on the third ball if you haven't gotten one yet\n(also on the right ramp), and by shooting the WABAC when Instant Tri-Ball is\nlit.\n\n(Actually, the game will spot 4 targets (maybe just one of each color) at\nthe start of the second ball.  Tri-Ball will be lit on your third ball if\nyou've not yet had it.\n\nThe opening animation is pretty amazing.  (You should watch someone else\nstart Tri-Ball sometime.)  The other amazing thing is that it DOESN'T\ninterfere with play, unlike the animation in, say, Star Wars.\n\nDuring Tri-Ball, you shoot the Hat Trick (left orbit) to light the jackpot.\nThe first jackpot is usually 20M points.  Every time you shoot the left\nramp, you increase the jackpot by 1M.  This appears to go on without limit.\nCollect the jackpot by shooting the right ramp.  If the jackpot is lit, then\nyou can shoot the Hat Trick again to light the double jackpot for about 8\nseconds.  There appears to be a very slight grace period on the double\njackpot, but you have to at least be on the ramp when it hits 0 to get it.\nRepeatedly shooting the Hat Trick resets the timer to 8.\n\nI can safely say now that there is NO quadruple jackpot in R&B.\n\nAfter collecting the jackpot, light it again by shooting the Hat Trick.  The\nnext jackpot base value, though, goes up by 5M, again supposedly without\nlimit.  It goes back to 20M with the start of the next Tri-Ball.\n\nThe big thing in Tri-Ball is the new addition of a Super Jackpot in DE\ngames.  All you have to do is complete the Pie during Tri-Ball.  :)  I don't\nthink there's a way to spot targets during Tri-Ball so you have to nail each\nBOMB letter 3 times.  If you actually manage to do this, then shoot the\nright ramp for 100M points!  You only have 15 seconds to do this, so do it\nquick.  Beware!  If you end Tri-Ball (drain 2 balls), then the SJ will\nbecome UNlit (and so will the jackpot, but NOT the double jackpot... weird).\nIf you miss the SJ, the Pie will revert to you needing only 1 of each BOMB\ntarget to relight it.  Pretty nice.  Same if you lose Tri-Ball:  Next Tri-\nBall starts with the Pie at 2 of each color already lit.\n\nOne interesting thing is that the Pie will KEEP its progress towards the SJ\nfor the duration of the game!  So if you missed the Pie by that one last\nletter, well, you have a chance to get it again if you start Tri-Ball again.\n\nLater, Tri-Balls are harder to light.  The first one, all BOMB targets are\nlit until you complete that color.  The second one, you have to get BOMB\nonce (all 4 shots) before you can shoot BOMB again.  Basically, you have to\nget all 4, then all 4 again, then all 4 again.  The 3rd time, you have to\nget the blue B 3 times, then the O 3 times, etc.  The 4th time, you have to\nhit 1 B, then 1 O, then 1 M, etc.  I'm not sure after that.  I think that's\nthe highest difficulty.\n\nYou cannot start WABAC rounds during Tri-Ball, but any round that was\nstarted before Tri-Ball will continue to operate normally.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:  If you complete the Hat Trick during Tri-Ball, and\nyou only have 2 balls in play, then the game will relaunch the 3rd ball for\nyou!  This makes it a LOT easier to keep your Tri-Ball an actual tri-ball\n(as opposed to a bi-ball).  This is most certainly worth shooting for, as it\nwill give you longer time to try to light the Super Jackpot, and keep your\ncurrent jackpot value growing.  What a great feature!\n\nKudos:  Yay to Brian Schmidt (sp?), the sound/music guy for DE...  The music\nafter you get a jackpot is just tremendous.  I love it.\nStrategies\nThe outlanes are pretty vicious in R&B.  You're going to have to do a bit of\nnudging in order to have a halfway decent ball-length time.\n\nI usually try to keep the kickback at 5M points with the return lane value\nadvances unless I'm already at 10X bonus, when bonus-hold would be worth\nquite a few points (20M).  Other than that 1 time, 5M is guaranteed to be\nworth the most.\n\nThere is apparently a trick (\"It's not a bug, it's a FEATURE!!!\") that if\nyou get a ball to roll over a lit \"Adv kickback value\" light just while the\nkickback is still flashing for the grace period, it WILL advance the\nkickback value, in the process, keeping it lit!\n\nAlways try to go for the ramp looping.  It'll get you to Tri-Ball a LOT\nfaster and get you higher scores in the long run.\n\nThe hardest shot to master, IMHO, is the right ramp.  On most machines,\nthere seems to be a fairly narrow sweet spot to it, compared to how wide the\nentrance to it is.  It's pretty important that you be able to hit it without\nmuch trouble, though.\n\nI usually just go for the Mystery Select as soon as it's lit unless I'm\nreally close to lighting the Super (1 or 2 letters).  The reason is, the\nawards just aren't all that much better for the SMS than the MS.  If you're\nlucky enough, you'll usually be offered pretty nice awards through the plain\nMystery Select.\n\nThe center shot is fairly important to get the hang of, too.  You can easily\nhit it from either flipper, though from the right flipper it's a bit of a\nbackhanded shot.\n\nKnow which puzzle you are going for and what it'll do.  And avoid finishing\nit, if you can, while other things are going on (e.g. Loose Moose).  I\npersonally like to concentrate on one thing at a time.\n\nIf you are going for the Back in Time puzzle, try to avoid finishing it\nuntil you've gotten some of the nicer awards off of the WABAC, like Tri-Ball\nand the ??? award.\n\nGet the Rhino shot down!  That's the shot that relights your Laser Kick.\nYou can find out how many shots you need to relight it by looking at the\n\"Instant Info\" by holding down a flipper.  Well, you have to catch a ball\nand hold it, because it won't show it to you while it's waiting for you to\nlaunch the ball.  It should, though.  Our machine usually needed 2 Rhino\nshots to relight it.  There's a big yellow arrow that blinks when the next\nRhino shot will relight it.\n\nKnow your mystery awards, and how easy they are to finish.  For example, a\nchoice of 10M & Save Nell, you should choose Save Nell because it's *easy*\nto get that 25M.\n\nIn Tri-Ball, you may not want to worry about double jackpots (unless we find\nout the quadruple jackpots DO exist).  Shooting the jackpot right away will\njust let you hit the Hat Trick again for the jackpot, at 5M higher, and\nunlimited time rather than the pressure of 8 seconds to shoot the double.\nIn the long run, it would actually be worth more NOT to shoot for the double\njackpot.  However, if you have a ball on each flipper, you might as well\ntake a shot at the lighting the double, because you'll have 2 chances to get\nit.  Certainly don't forget to try to relaunch that 3rd ball when you can!\nThanks!\nKevin Martin for providing a magazine that had the R&B\nplayfield on it, and later helping me to figure out some stuff while we\nplayed it the day after I posted the sheet!  (We found one way out in the\nboonies.)\n\nBowen for a little Hat Trick help, and some more\nhelp regarding \"defuse the bomb.\"\n\nFelix Lee for quite a bit of useful information\nthat we later confirmed, and the kickback relight trick.\n\nJohn Yeates for a pointing out a minor faux pas.  %)\n\nThis is my fourth rule sheet, now.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Rollergames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Rollergames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2.0 (January 8, 1994)\nBy Michael Dunn\n\n\nChanges From Version 1.x\nI added 2 Roller Motion awards, a Sudden Death award, and made the sheet\nmore organized and in general easier to read.  I realized after looking over\nthe sheet that the reorganization was sorely needed!\nBackground\n\"Rollergames\" started out as a weekly TV show featuring a six-team roller\nderby league.  It was as staged as pro wrestling, but when you put aside all\nthe antics, the games themselves were fun to watch.\n\nWilliams has taken this rather obscure show and built a pinball with the\nshow as its theme.  There are numerous references to things from the show (like\nThe Wall and Roller Motion), as well as some rather loud quotes from one of the\nannouncers (his favorite quote is \"Devastating\" spoken at about 90 decibels).\nThe pin has several goals, but since none of the yields astronomical awards,\nyou'll need to shoot for several of them repeatedly to rack up the points.\n\nRollergames has a 2-line alphanumeric display.  The highest displayable\nscore is 99,999,990.  Unfortunately, if you break 100 million, you don't\nautomatically get on the high score list; in fact you don't get a single thing!\nThe game totally forgets all the hard work you did to get those 100 million\npoints.\n\n\"Multiball\" is a trademark of Williams, and \"Rollergames\" is somebody's\ntrademark, I'm sure.\n\nIn this sheet, I'll use the abbreviation \"K\" for a thousand points, and\n\"M\" for a million points.  When I refer to something in the game that has a\nspecific name, I'll capitalize the name so you know that you can find info\nabout it here.\n\nI'm doing this sheet from memory, so forgive any inaccuracies.  This IS\nversion 2.0, so most of the info should be correct.  There are still a couple\nof things that I'm not sure about; those will be flagged with a question mark\nto indicate that they are guesses.  If you have any info I've left out, please\nmail it to me at any of the above addresses, preferably the Internet address.\nThank you for your support.\nGeneral Layout\nStarting at the lower left and moving roughly clockwise, here's what you'll\nfind in Rollergames:\n\n\nLeft outlane  There is a kickback here, and a red special light.  Now, before\nyou get mad and think, \"There's a mile-wide left outlane, right?\" this\nkickback lane is not a black hole; the kicker shoots straight back\n(reminiscent of F-14 Tomcat), up a little ramp, onto another kicker that is\nnot otherwise in play, and finally around the orbit to the upper left\nflipper.\n\nLeft inlane  Lights the right Jetway and scores a few points.  The divider\nbetween the inlane and outlane is just a piece of metal, so nudging the ball\naway from the outlane is not easy to do.\n\nLeft standup targets (SKATE)  These 5 targets face directly right and form the\nleft side of the playfield (the Kickback actually sends the ball behind\nthese targets).  Each target has a light in front of it, indicating whether\nit has (steady light) or has not (flashing light) been hit.  Completing the\ntargets lights a letter in WILLIAMS and lights the Magnet.  It is possible\nto hit these targets with the left flipper, and there is a magical point on\nthe bank (different for every machine, of course) where you can shoot the\nball with the right flipper and have the ball land in the Pit.\n\nLeft Jetway  This is the left side of the orbit.  There is a spinner and an\norange Jetway light at the entrance.  This shot is also the first half of\nthe Combo Shot.\n\nThe Pit  This is a saucer just to the right of the left Jetway.  The saucer is\ncompletely enclosed.  You shoot the ball through a one-way gate into the\nenclosure, so you can shoot the ball as hard as you like and it'll stay in\nthere.  The ball exits by a vertical upkick onto a habitrail, which deposits\nthe ball at the upper right flipper.  There are three things the Pit can\naward:  Roller Motion, Magnet, and Scoring Cycle.  Each award has its own\narrow light to indicate when it is available.  The Pit can be hit from\neither lower flipper.\n\nThe Wall  This is a VERY steep ramp, reachable only from the upper right\nflipper.  The ball can exit from the ramp in three ways:  a diverter can\nsend it down a habitrail that feeds the left Inlane; another diverter can\nsend it down a winding habitrail to either the Lock or the right Inlane\n(another diverter controls when balls enter the Lock mechanism); finally,\nthe ball can go all the way across the ramp, fall off the end, and land\nabove the upper right flipper.  There are three arrow lights on the\nplayfield that indicate awards you can collect at the Wall:  Jackpot (red),\nLock (green), and Million (orange).\n\nCenter Standups (123)  These targets face right, and are not easily reachable\nfrom the flippers except by a lucky bounce off something else.  Usually the\nball hits these targets when it's being knocked around by the bumpers.\nCompleting the targets lights Roller Motion.\n\nCenter Lane  The first time I saw this lane, I thought it would be impossible\nto hit, and it almost is.  You need to shoot the ball literally straight\nback, through a narrow space between the Drop Targets and the ramp entrance,\nand then between the Center Standups and the bumpers.  This lane feeds to\nthe left Orbit, above the spinner.  So, why would you ever shoot for this\nlane?  Well, it's where you collect extra balls, that's why!  Sometimes, if\nyou're lucky, the ball will roll down the J lane and be kicked around this\nlane by the bumpers.  Extra balls can be stacked here, and they remain lit\nuntil collected.\n\nDrop Targets (WAR)  These three targets are placed below the bumpers.  They\nare arranged horizontally but angled a bit to face the lower left flipper.\nEach target is labeled \"MULTI-BALL\" and has a green light in front of it to\nindicate if it's been collected (steady light), not collected and not timed\n(light off), or not collected and on the timer (timeout-flash pattern).\nThese targets award Locks during one-ball play, and points during Multiball.\nThe targets can be hit from any flipper.  You can even sweep all three with\nthe upper right flipper (but there is no bonus for doing so).  If you really\nwant to show off, you can sweep the targets AND hit the ramp, all with one\nshot!\n\nBumpers  Three of 'em.  Two just below the Rollover Lanes and another below\nthose two.  The ball can exit down the middle of the board (past the left\nside of the Drop Targets) or to the upper right flipper.\n\nRollover Lanes (JET)  These three lanes are above the bumpers.  Completing\nthem advances the bonus multiplier, up to a max of 7x.  Completing the lanes\nafter the multiplier is at its max awards 100K(?).  These lanes are not\nsaved between balls.  You can rotate the lit lanes to the right by pressing\neither flipper button.  It is pretty hard to hit these lanes purposely,\nsince there are no gates in the orbit (which passes above the lanes) to stop\nthe ball from zooming on by.\n\nUpper right flipper  This standard-length flipper lies along the right side of\nthe right Jetway.  Use it to hit the Wall.\n\nThe Magnet  This is located at the tip of the upper right flipper.  Activate\nit by hitting the Pit when the Magnet light there is lit.  The Magnet is\nrelit by the Left Standups.\n\nLock mechanism  This is just a kicker at the end of one of the habitrails\nleading away from the ramp.  There is room to hold 3 balls.  Sometimes,\nduring one-ball play, the locked balls will be kicked out, around the\nhabitrails, and back into the Lock.  This is supposed to look like skaters\ngoing around a track.\n\nRight Jetway  This lane has a spinner and a Jetway light at its entrance.\n\nRight Standups (ABC)  These three targets are placed low on the right side,\nand are angled to face the lower left flipper.  Completing these targets\nrelights the Kickback.\n\nRight Outlane  Just like the left, but sans Kickback.\n\nRight Inlane  This lane lights the left Jetway.  The divider between the\ninlane and outlane is a piece of metal--not much rubber on this side,\neither.\n\nRollergames Team Lights  These 6 lights are located in the open area in the\nmiddle of the board.  They indicate your progress on the Jetway.\n\nSlingshots  2 of 'em.\n\nLower Flippers  2 of 'em.\n\nPlunger  A manual plunger.  Plunging at full strength will send the ball up\nthe Wall.\n\n\nNow on to the rules....\nThe Jetway\nThe two Jetways are independent of each other, and both can be lit at the\nsame time.  A Jetway is lit by rolling through an inlane.  The left Inlane\nlights the right Jetway, and vice versa.  You can also light an unlit Jetway by\nshooting the ball around the entire orbit.\n\nTo collect a lit Jetway, you only have to hit the spinner.  So if both\nJetways are lit, shooting the entire orbit will collect both Jetways.\n\nCollecting a Jetway spots a Rollergames Team.  Lighting all 6 teams lights\nan Extra Ball at the Center Lane.  At the start of the game, you get 2 teams\nlit for free, but after collecting all the teams once, you don't get any more\nfreebies.  The teams you light are not saved between balls, and you can light\nonly one extra ball from the teams per ball.  After all 6 teams are lit, the\nJetways are worth 250K for the remainder of the ball.\nThe Magnet\nThe Magnet gives you a little bit of assistance in shooting the Wall.\nWhen the Magnet light at the Pit is lit, shooting the Pit activates the Magnet,\nwhich is at the tip of the upper right flipper.  Here's the sequence of events:\nThe screen shows \"Don't flip\" and the announcer says \"Don't flip\" as the ball\nrolls along the habitrail.  The screen then counts down \"Three--Two--One,\"\nestimating the time until the ball will come to rest on the magnet.  After the\ncountdown, the screen says (and the announcer yells) \"Flip,\" by which time the\nball should be at rest on the magnet (although I have seen games where the\nmagnet was too weak to catch the ball).  If the ball stops early, go ahead and\nflip; the game won't mind if you don't wait.\n\nIf you flip too early, the magnet will turn off immediately, so don't do\nit!  It will also turn off if you wait too long after being ordered to \"Flip!\"\nIf something goes wrong with the magnet or the Pit kicker, you're outta luck.\nThe game will continue on as if everything were OK, and you'll lose the chance\nat the easy ramp shot.\n\nThe Magnet turns off after one shot, and is relit at the start of each\nball, at the start of Multiball, when Instant Lock is awarded by Roller Motion,\nand when the Left Standups are completed.\nRoller Motion\nThis is a semi-random award.  Shoot the Pit to collect Roller Motion when\nit is lit.  Here's the possible awards:\n\n\n Penalty Pit:  No points.  Bummer.\n Jetter Bonus:  100K to 200K points.\n Bonus Held:  Holds the end-of-ball bonus.  Maybe the multipliers too(??).\n Instant Lock:  A VERY generous award.  One lock AND the Magnet are lit.\n WILLIAMS Letter:  Spots the next letter in WILLIAMS.\n Spot Team:  Lights the next Rollergames Team.\n Bonus X:  Advances the bonus multiplier.\n Extra Ball:  Devastating.\n Lite Special:  Lights the outlanes.\n\n\nI don't remember if an award is purposely not given when the associated\nsequence is complete, e.g. awarding Bonus X when the multiplier is already at\n7x.  I assume the game is smart enough not to do this, or at least award some\npoints instead.\n\nRoller Motion is lit at the start of the game, and is relit by the Center\nStandups.  It is not lit automatically at the start of each ball.\nThe WILLIAMS Scoring Cycle\nThe WILLIAMS sequence carries over between balls, players, and games.\nProgress towards completing it is shown in the status report and whenever a\nletter is awarded.  Completing the sequence starts the Scoring Cycle, which is\na hurry-up round.  Its value starts at 4M and counts down to 1M.  Shoot the Pit\nto collect the points.\n\nThere is a short pause before the countdown starts, so it's possible,\nthough very hard, to get the full 4M.  There's also a pause after the timer\nreaches 1M.\n\nIf you collect the Scoring Cycle, the WILLIAMS sequence resets completely.\nBut if you do not collect it, the sequence goes back 4 letters (this is\nadjustable, 4 is the default).\n\nThe best way I know to get the full 4M is to find the magic point on the\nleft Standup bank where you can shoot the ball and have it bounce into the Pit,\nthen hope that that target or targets are the last ones needed to start the\nScoring Cycle.\nSudden Death\nThis round starts randomly during one-ball play, once or maybe twice in a\ngame.  You'll know that it has started when you hear the announcer yell (can't\nhe say anything in a normal voice?) \"It's Sudden Death!  Go for the Wall!\"  A\n15-second timer starts, and hitting the Wall before time runs out awards 1M and\nresets the timer.  If you complete both SKATE and WAR, the round ends and you\nget 2M.  I have also seen the round end early if the ramp is hit too many times\n(about 5 or 6 times in quick succession).\nThe Combo Shot\nShooting the left Jetway (lit or unlit) and then the ramp awards 100K the\nfirst time, 200K the second time, and so on up to a max of 500K.  The combo is\nawarded in addition to anything else that might be lit at the ramp, so you can\nget a Power Play and a combo at the same time, although only the combo display\nwill be shown.\nMultiball\nLocking three balls starts multiball.  The balls are kicked out of the\nlock mechanism and come screaming down the right inlane all at once (a VERY\nannoying design IMHO).  There is only one thing to do:  hit the Wall to collect\nthe jackpot, which is worth between 1.5M and 4M.  The Magnet is automatically\nlit at the start of multiball, so you have a little help in collecting the\nfirst jackpot.\n\nThe jackpot is lit as long as 2 or 3 balls are in play, but it resets to\n1.5M each time it's collected, so only the first jackpot is worth a significant\namount of points.  Hitting stuff during multiball adds to the jackpot.  Once\nyou lose 2 balls, normal play resumes.  There is no restart shot.\n\nDuring multiball, the Scoring Cycle, Magnet, and Jetways operate as usual,\nbut you cannot collect Roller Motion until normal play resumes.  There are also\nother bonuses available during multiball:  completing SKATE awards 100K the\nfirst time, 150K the second time, 200K the third time, and so on up to a max of\n500K.  Completing WAR awards a bonus with the same scoring scheme.  After\nmultiball ends, the SKATE standups reset, for no real reason.\n\nWhen you collect the first Jackpot, the ball you hit up the ramp will be\ndiverted into the Lock while the jackpot-collected display runs and the\nannouncer yells \"Kick Butt!\"  Subsequent jackpots only get the quote\n\"Devastating!  Outrageous!  Unbelievable!\" and the ball will not always go into\nthe Lock.  Any ball that goes into the Lock will be held there only for a few\nseconds.\nOther Stuff\n\nSome notes on the Wall diverters  If Lock is lit, the ball will be diverted\ninto the Lock unless it was moving slowly and didn't reach the diverter.  If\nthe ball falls down the left exit, or even back down the ramp entrance, no\nlock is awarded but Lock remains lit.  If both Million and Lock are lit, the\nball may be diverted into the lock, but not always.  If it is, and if that\nwasn't the third lock, when you shoot the next ball up the ramp, you'll get\nanother million award.  But a Lock is never awarded on a plunger shot.\n\nMore Wall stuff  The switch that registers a successful shot up the Wall is on\nthe upslope of the entrance, before the level area at the top where the\ndiverters are.  So, a weakly hit ball can go up the entrance, hit the\nswitch, stall before going all the way up the entrance, and fall back down\nover the switch, thus earning two awards.  This is an especially nice\nfeature. ;>\n\nPower Plays  Hitting the Wall when nothing is lit (except a possible Combo\nShot) awards a Power Play.  3 Power Plays lights Extra Ball, and 8 Power\nPlays lights the outlane Specials.  (These values are probably adjustable.)\nPower Plays carry over for the entire game.\n\nOutlane Specials  Whenever you get a light Special award, both outlanes are\nlit and remain lit until one is hit, at which point both outlanes turn off.\n\nCows  Nope, no cows, but the TV show did have alligators once.\n\nClosing Credits\nThanx to those folks on rec.games.pinball who helped me with my memory gaps,\nand to Karl Brostroem (for whom I originally wrote this rules sheet :).  Man,\nthis thing REALLY looks good now, compared to the older ones!

Coriale\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis rule sheet describes the Safe Cracker\u00ae game by Bally\u00ae.  Safe\nCracker is the first \"Token-Pin\u00ae\" - a pinball game that also\ndispenses collectable tokens.  There are 20 collectable tokens,\nincluding one which is silver colored.  As with most modern pinball\ngames, Safe Cracker has many settings that govern the way the machine\nbehaves.  This rules sheet does not detail these settings.  This is\nnot the ultimate rule sheet for this game.  Many pieces of\ninformation are missing (intentionally or otherwise), and very little\nstrategy is discussed.  I encourage someone else to spend some time\nediting and filling in the blanks.\n\nGeneral Description of the Game\n\nSafe Cracker is a timed pinball game with an interactive board game.\nThe player's score is determined by a combination of pinball play and\nthe results of the board game.  The main objective of Safe Cracker is\nto break into the bank and play the board game.  At the end of the\nboard game is \"The Vault\".  The Vault is where the player obtains\ntokens and many points.\n\nThe Design Team\n\nSafe Cracker was designed by:\n\n Pat Lawlor: Concept, Design, and Playfield\n Matt Coriale: Software and Design\n John Youssi: Art\n Dean Grover: Software and Design\n John Krutch: Mechanix\n Carl Biagi: Mechanix\n Adam Rhine: Dot Matrix Art\n Brian Morris: Dot Matrix Art\n Dan Forden: Sounds & Music\n Lyman Sheats: \"Assault on the Vault\" Programming\n And a cast of thousands...\n\n\n\"Main Play\" rules:\n\nObjective(s)\n\nThe player has 4 goals during \"Main Play\": accumulate points,\naccumulate time, alter the state of the board game for the best odds\nof getting to the vault, and breaking into the bank.\n\nThe Timer and Timer Lights\n\nEach player starts with a set amount of time.  The timer runs whenever\nthe player is in main play.  The amount of time the player has\nremaining is shown in two places: on the timer lights in the center\nof the playfield, and a \"life bar\" on the display during score\nsweep.  Almost all switches on the playfield add a very small amount\nof time or pause the timer briefly.  This encourages the player to\nkeep the ball moving.\n\nSudden Death\n\nWhen the player runs out of time, the game goes into \"Sudden Death\".\nThis means that when the player loses the ball, the game ends. During\nsudden death, the game will not add time for most common events.  The\nplayer can add time by several means, but most normal main-play rules\nno longer add time.  If the player executes a rule which adds time\nduring sudden death, the game comes out of sudden death, and normal\nmain play rules then allow time to be added again.\n\nDrop Targets\n\nBottom Left 3-Bank\n\nThe bottom left 3-bank has two main purposes: to spot other drop\ntargets, and to add additional entrances for \"break-ins\".\n\nOther Drop Targets\n\nThe remaining drop targets are used to light entrances for breaking\ninto the bank.  To light an entrance, the player shoots the blinking\ndrop target sets.  When all blinking sets have been completed, the\nplayer can then shoot the \"lock\" shot.  After locking the first ball,\nthe bottom left 3-bank lights additional entrances into the bank.\n\nThe Big-Kick and Bob's Getaway\n\nThe Big-Kick on the left side of the playfield gives \"Bob's Getaway\".\nThis is a random number of points that ascends during game play.\n\nThe Wheel and Wheel Awards\n\nThe Wheel is important for several reasons.  First, it is a good way\nto add lots of time during main play.  When the wheel is lit, it adds\nmore time than when it is unlit.  The amount of time added is\nproportional to how much it spins.  When the wheel is lit, it\nadvances the current \"wheel award\".  The current award is shown on\nfour lights in the center of the playfield.  To collect the \"wheel\naward\", the player must shoot into the main entrance of the bank (a\nscoop in the center of the playfield).\n\nLight Locks\n\nThis award bypasses the needed drop target sets and immediately lights\nthe locks on the left ramp.\n\nDisable Computer\n\nThis award starts a short mode, during which the timer is held.  If\nthe player is in sudden death, this mode will keep the game from\nending if the ball is drained.\n\nDeposit Window\n\nThis award gives a \"free gift\" form the teller.  There are many\ngifts, ranging from 20 \"minutes\" of time on the clock to a free\ntoken.\n\nCall Guard\n\nThis award randomly allows the player to break into the bank for free.\nOther times, it just awards points.\n\nThe Sliding Target (Manhole Awards)\n\nThe sliding target gives several awards.  To get the award, the\nplayer must hit the target all the way back, and then drop the ball\nthrough the hole behind the target.\n\nATM Card\n\nMultiplies the awards from the '$' spots in the board game.\n\nNote to Teller\n\nUsed to get past the teller on the board game.\n\nExplosives\n\nStarts a frenzy where the drop sets score big points.\n\nSafe #\n\nAwards a letter in the word \"VAULT\".  When the player completes\n\"VAULT\", the next break-in to the vault results in Token Multiball.\nThese letters are held from game to game.\n\nLite Outlanes\n\nLites the outlanes for \"Extra Time\".\n\nThe Left Ramp and Donuts\n\nThe left ramp is used to collect donuts, lock balls, and collect\nvarious jackpots.\n\nThe Main Entrance and the Deposit Window (\"Gift Lady\")\n\nThe \"Main Entrance\" is a shot into a scoop in the center of the\nplayfield.  This shot is used to collect wheel awards and to start\nthe board game.\n\nThe Top Lanes and the \"Roof\" entrance.\n\nThe top lanes (labeled A,B,C) are used to add time to the clock.\nCompleting the ABC lights adds 5 \"minutes\" to the timer.  The center\nlane is also used to enter to board game through the \"roof\" when lit.\n\nThe Jets, and Jet Levels\n\nThe jets add time to the clock for each hit.  Lit jets add more time\nthan unlit jets.  Jets are lit by completing drop sets.\n\nThe \"ALARM\" Targets\n\nSpelling out the ALARM targets disables an alarm on the board game.\n\nThe \"Extra Time\" lights on the outlanes\n\nRolling over the \"Extra Time\" lights, when lit, adds time to the\nclock, even if the game was in sudden death.\n\nThe Return Lanes:\n\nLite Deposit Window\n\nLites the \"Main Entrance\" for a free gift.\n\nLite 2 Donuts\n\nTimes out the ramp shot for 2 donuts.\n\nBonus Multipliers and Bonus\n\nEach entrance to the bank advances the bonus multiplier, which is\nindicated in lights at the bottom of the playfield.  The bonus is\ncomputed only at the end of the game.\n\nMulti-Player Games\n\nIn Multi-Player games, each player plays in turn until they run out\nof time.  All remaining players continue until all players have run\nout of time.  New players may be added at any time, up until any\nplayer has entered sudden death.\n\nTilting\n\nIf a player tilts during sudden death, the game ends without any\nbonus. If the player tilts with time left on the clock, the game\ncontinues, but the player is now in sudden death.\n\nThe \"Board Game\":\n\nObjective(s)\n\nThe Board Game is the main feature of Safe Cracker.  The player can\nincrease the odds of successfully completing the board game by using\nthe Pinball rules to modify the various landing spots and rules of\nthe board. Completing the board game lands the player in \"The Vault\",\nwhere at least one token can be won.  During the board game, a guard\n(indicated by a slow blinking light) chases the player (indicated by\na fast blinking light). If the guard catches up with the player, the\nboard game ends.\n\nThe Three Entrances\n\nThe three entrances to the bank are the \"Cellar\" (behind the sliding\ntarget), the \"Main Entrance\" (the scoop in the center of the\nplayfield), and the \"Roof\" (the center lane above the jets).  The\nentrance that the player uses to start the board game determines how\nfar the player must travel to reach \"The Vault\".  The path the player\nwill take is determined by drawing a path from the corresponding\nentrance light on the board, clockwise around the center circle, and\nentering the first unlit \"gate\".\n\nSpinning the Safe Knob\n\nThe player's movement is determined by stopping the safe knob using\nflipper buttons.  There is an adjustment for this feature.  When set\nfor \"random\", the knob will stop on a truly random number, otherwise,\nthe knob will stop based on when the player hits the flipper buttons.\n\nThe Guard's Roll\n\nThe Guard begins chasing the player after the player has moved\nseveral spots.  The Guard chases the player from the entrance that\nthe player starts the board game from.  The Guard's movement is\ndetermined by a purely random roll of the dice.\n\nYour Stash\n\nDuring the board game, the player accumulates a \"stash\" of money.\nThis money is not added to the player's score automatically, it is\nused as a reward for successfully completing the board game.  If the\nfeature adjustment is set for giving a choice to \"continue or quit\",\nthe player may quit the board game after any successful spin and take\nthe stash.\n\n'$'\n\nThe '$' spot adds money to the player's stash.  This value is\nmultiplied by the number of ATM cards collected.\n\n'?'\n\nThe '?' game puts up several items on the screen and gives the player\none of them by stopping a randomly moving box when the player presses\nthe flippers.  These items can be both good and bad.\n\nMoney Bag\n\nThe money bag adds money to the player's stash.\n\nMove Forward\n\nThe clockwise arrow moves the player forward several spots.  The\nplayer then receives the appropriate award or consequence of the spot\nlanded on.\n\nTime\n\nThe stopwatch adds time to the clock, even if the player is in sudden\ndeath.\n\nDog Biscuit\n\nThe dog biscuit is used to defeat the CyberDog.  The player can\naccumulate multiple dog biscuits, and each time the player lands on\nthe CyberDog spot, one is subtracted.\n\nCode\n\nThe \"code\" adds a letter to the VAULT spell-up.\n\nDonuts\n\nThe Donuts add 12 donuts to the player's collection.\n\nKey\n\nThe key is used to unlock a \"locked\" gate.  If the player has a key\nwhen landing on the gate spot, the player may continue.  The player\nmay accumulate multiple keys.\n\nMove Cop Backwards\n\nThe counter-clockwise arrow with the guard's hat moves the guard\nbackwards.  This is usually good, but can also be bad.  If this\nresults in the guard moving backwards onto the player, the player is\ncaught and the board game ends.\n\nDisable Alarm\n\nThis disables an alarm spot.\n\nWinged Shoe\n\nThis gives the player the chance to run \"around\" the board.  Pressing\nthe flippers decelerates the player's spot to a stop.  Dean wrote it\nin a cough-syrup induced haze -Ed.\n\nLightning Bolt\n\nThe lightning bolt sends a \"lightning bolt\" around the board.   This\ntravels around the board until it comes to either the player or the\nguard.  If it hits the guard, it removes the guard from the board.  If\nit hits the player, it ends the board game.\n\nTNT Keg\n\nThe TNT keg ends the board game and starts TNT multiball.\n\nToken\n\nThis dispenses a free token and allows the player to continue playing\nthe board game.\n\nBribe\n\nThe bribe spot causes the guard to ask you for about half of your\nmoney. Each time the guard asks, you can choose to give him the money\nor turn him down.  If the guard is turned down too many times, he\nwill eventually \"catch\" the player and end the board game.\n\nCandy 2000\n\nThe Candy 2000 game scrolls randomized letter combinations across the\nscreen.  Choosing certain 3 letter combinations will give awards, like\ndog biscuits and keys.\n\nCyberDog\n\nThe CyberDog starts a hurry-up style mode where the player's ball is\nejected to the playfield and the player's spot on the board game\nstarts moving.  When the player shoots the ball back into any\nentrance, the player continues the board game from the spot where the\nlight currently is.  If the player has a dog biscuit, the CyberDog\ntakes the dog biscuit and does not start the pinball mode.\n\nAlarms and Alarm Mode\n\nThe alarm spots start the \"Alarm Mode\" if the player lands on them\nwhen lit.  If they are not lit, they are a free spot.  In \"Alarm\nMode\", the player's ball is ejected and the player must shoot the\nball into the \"Cellar\" entrance behind the sliding target to continue\nthe board game.  If the shot is not made in time, the stash is lost\nand regular main-play resumes.  If the player successfully shoots the\nsliding target, the board game resumes with the player starting from\nthe \"Cellar\" entrance.\n\nGates\n\nThe gate spots serve two purposes.  The first is to determine the path\nthe player will take to get into the Vault.  The gate lights are\nturned off by completing locks.  The more locks the player gets, the\nmore gates that are opened. During the board game, the player will\nturn in towards the Vault at the first open gate.  If the player\nlands on the gate square, a quick game is played with open and locked\ngates shown on the display.  If the player gets a locked gate, the\nboard game ends.  If the player gets an open gate, the board game\ncontinues.\n\nTeller\n\nThe Teller spot gives the player a random chance of receiving a good\naward or a money-bomb.  The money-bomb ends the board game.  If the\nplayer has a \"Note to Teller\", the teller will take the note and not\ngive the player the money-bomb.\n\nRun N' Hide\n\nRun N' Hide bounces the player's spot around randomly within a window\nof several spots from the Run N' Hide.  When the player presses the\nflippers, the board game continues from where the player's spot\nlands.  The player also plays the rules for the spot landed on.\n\n'#'\n\nThe '#' spot gives a \"Big Find\" of $100,000.\n\n'!'\n\nThe '!' spot is a laser beam that ends the board game.\n\nThe Vault\n\nThe Vault is the end of the board game.  The player receives at least\none token.  If the VAULT spell-up is completed, the player then plays\n\"Token Multiball\", otherwise, the player then plays \"Vault\nMultiball\", with the current stash value used as the jackpot.\n\nTNT Multiball\n\nTNT Multiball is a frenzy where all switches score, and completing\ndrop sets give time, even if the player is in sudden death.\n\nToken Multiball\n\nIn Token Multiball, a progressive jackpot of tokens is available for\nthe player to win.  Each jackpot shot gives the player one token from\nthe jackpot.  If the jackpot becomes depleted (or if a token can not\nbe dispensed because it is empty or jammed), points are substituted.\nAt the end of token multiball, the VAULT spell-up is reset,\nregardless of how many tokens are won.\n\nVault Multiball\n\nIn Vault Multiball, the jackpot value is set to the player's stash\nvalue from the board game.  Jackpots are received from the ramp shot,\nand must be re-lit by hitting the wheel.\n\nAssault on the Vault\n\nThe \"Assault On The Vault\" multiball is given as an award for putting\nthe token back into the game.  It is a timed multiball during which\nthe player advances lights from each of the entrances in the board\ngame towards The Vault.  Paths are advanced by completing drop target\nsets.  The bottom left drop target set will advance all three paths\nby one spot.  A bonus is built up based on the number of spots lit\nup, the number of paths completed all the way into the vault, and the\nnumber of Jackpot shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Safe Cracker", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/safecracker.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Safe Cracker", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

If you find\nsomething omitted or wrong, please e-mail me. I did not bother to write in\npoint values for each individual switch (i.e. 'Right Orbit' scores $130.),\nsince to me personally, WHAT a switch does is more important. 'Sides, if\nyou're going for score, learn how to play the game, and figure it out by\nyourself. :> Also, MANY options can be changed in the adjustments, the\nrulesheet goes over basic factory defaults. A list of changes that can be\ndone to the game are listed at the end of the rulesheet.\nThis is saved as a normal text file, typed up in MS Word. I know it's\nlong, but I like to be thorough, and there is A LOT in this game. Also,\neverything in here is based on ROM Revision 1.8. I know of several differences\nbetween 1.2 and 1.8 that I noticed off-hand, so take everything by face value\nif you're running on a different version.\n[2] GAME RULES\n[2.1] General Notes:\nWelcome to Safe Cracker. Obviously, this is no ordinary game. Not only\ndo you receive tokens from the game, the game is TIMED, and is smaller than a\nnormal pinball. It's size is about in relation to a normal game as a normal\ngame is to a wide-body (Superpin). The idea behind the game was to tie pinball\ninto redemption - players could redeem tokens for prizes or other such stuff,\nor collect them.\n\n[2.2] Basic Overview:\nThe basic idea of the game is to make it into the bank, past the\nguard, guard dog and alarms while trying to put-off the Computer (Candy 2000).\nThe ultimate goal is to break into the Vault, and collect the stash. There are\nmany obstacles along the way, including your time limit. You can pick up items\nalong the way that will help you reach your goal.\n\n[2.3] Pinball Rules - \nYou play the pinball half to get into the bank, and to get BACK into\nthe bank after being kicked out of the board game. You can set up the board\ngame to your liking and collect items that will help you in the board game\nduring this mode. The next sections describe items around the playfield, and\nexplain what they do in the different modes of the game.\nThere are two 'modes' in the pinball: Timed and Sudden Death. When in\nTimed Play, you have time on the clock and any drain will be immediately\nserved back to you. If in multi-player mode, the next player is up. Also in\nthis mode, hitting switches add a *bit* of time to your timer. Most times it's\nnot noticeable, but a good spin on the wheel can give you a good :05 or :10.\nAfter each Board Game, the timer counts down faster, and it's harder to stay\nout of Sudden Death. Sudden Death is just that: Drain, and your game's over.\nThere is no way to get out of Sudden Death just by hitting switches. You must\nregain time by getting TNT Multiball, a Teller Gift, or an outlane.\nThe inner wheel awards items that can help you in various ways:\n\n Light Lock: If LOCK isn't lit, LOCK is then lit. If LOCK is lit,\nthen it awards a LOCK for you. If two balls are locked, then it opens the Main\nEntrance for you, immediately starting the board game.\n Call Guard: Will Call the Guard. You will either be awarded $100k or\nhe'll open a gate for you, immediately starting the board game.\n Deposit Window: Same as if you hit the left inlane. Gives you a\nvisit to the Teller Lady.\n Disable Computer: Will disable computer for 20 seconds. If in Timed\nmode, your timer is suspended, and hitting targets will add to the time you\nhave. Also, 'Explosives' mode timer is halted during this. If in Sudden Death,\nyou can drain and get your ball back. Once you drain, your timer is restarted.\n\nThe Teller Lady can also give you some helpful items:\n\n Blender: Sorry, doesn't help you at all.\n Time: Gives you from :05 to :20 minutes.\n TNT Multiball: Starts TNT Multiball.\n Lite Lock: Same as the Wheel Award.\n Lite Wheel: Lights the disc for the Wheel Award.\n Money Bomb: Only awarded in board game. See Board Game for details.\n Bank Entrance: Will open an Bank Entrance for you.\n Money: Will award $50k.\n Free Token: Will award the player a Token.\n Donuts: Will award 4, 6 or 12 donuts.\n Bonus X: Increases your Bonus Multiplier\n\nTNT Multiball is started any time you are kicked out of the board game\nwith a chance to restart (and hitting the Ramp), from the '?' space on the\nboard game, selecting the code on Candy 2000, or from the Teller Lady. You\nhave a certain number of targets to hit, and once you hit them all, you are\nawarded $5k and :05 on your timer.\nVault Multiball is started once you break into the Vault. Jackpot is\nthe Ramp shot, and the value is your stash when getting into the vault. Once\nyou hit the Jackpot, you need to relight it by hitting the Spinning Disc.\nJackpot will also award :10 on your timer. (This Multiball is Three Ball)\nOnce you collect all the V-A-U-L-T letters and break into the Vault,\nyou start Token Multiball. Jackpots still award your stash value, but you also\nreceive a Token. Shoot the Ramp to dispense a Token, and the Spinning Disk\nto relight the Ramp. The maximum number of tokens possible to win during\nToken Multiball is an operator setting. (This Multiball is Four Ball)\nIf you Tilt while in Timed Play, all time is taken away and you get\nthe ball back, in Sudden Death. If you Tilt in Sudden Death, your game is\nover, and your bonus is counted up. Yes, you can tilt in the Board Game, as\nwell.\nThe rest of the rules are described below with their associated items.\nSee the next section for setting up the board game for the quickest route.\n\n\n[2.3.01] Flippers:The bottom two flippers are slightly larger than the small\nflippers used on other Lawlor games (Addams Family, Twilight Zone). They work\njust like normal flippers.\n[2.3.02] Left Lanes:Normal-as-usual lanes. Inlane is labeled: 'Light Deposit\nWindow' and outlane is 'Extra Time'. Unless you have an uncollected award\nwaiting from the Wheel, this will light the Bank for a visit to the teller.\nExtra time will give you 20 seconds.\n[2.3.03] Bob's Getaway:Above the left lanes is a bigkick, similar to Twilight\nZone's Rocket Kicker, which sends the ball up the back of the playfield. If\nLOCK isn't lit, this will spot one drop target needed to light LOCK. This shot\nalso lights the 'Lite 2 Donuts' right inlane. Bob's Getaway awards an initial\nrandom value between $5k and $10k, and raises each consecutive shot into\nBob's.\n[2.3.04] Yellow Drop Targets:Mounted in front of Bob's Getaway are three drop\ntargets. If LOCK isn't lit, getting all three will spot one drop target. If\nLOCK is lit and there are closed bank entrances, these will open up a bank\nentry, for starting the board game.\n[2.3.05] Spinning Disc:Above the Yellow Drop Targets and Bob's Getaway is a\nspinning disc. If 'SPIN WHEEL' is lit, spinning the Disc will spin the award\non the inner dial, and light the bank entrance for collecting that award.\nSpinning the disc is also the best way for regaining some time.\n[2.3.06] Cellar Entrance:Above the Spinning Disc is a 'Moving Target'. With\neach hit the target will move back, uncovering a hole behind it. Shooting in\nthis will award the cellar award, or to enter into the bank. Possible awards\nfor the Cellar Award:\n\n ATM Card: Gives you an ATM Card, used in the Board Game.\n  Note To Teller: Note for the Teller, taken in the Board Game.\n  Explosives: Starts a timed mode, similar to 'Frenzy' in Funhouse. Every switch is $5k.\n  Safe # / Invisible: Awards a 'VAULT' letter.\n  Light Outlanes: Lights ONE outlane.\n\n\n[2.3.07] 'ALARM' Targets:Situated around the playfield are the 'ALARM'\ntargets. Completing them disables an alarm on the board game, starting with\n#1. After all are disabled, they award $50k.\n[2.3.08] Ramp:The ramp loops up and down the left side of the playfield, with\na crossover and diverter near the top, sending the ball to the right half of\nthe ramp. It can be shot for a Lock, Jackpot, or Donut. If nothing is lit, the\nramp returns the ball to the left inlane, and awards one or two donuts. If\nLOCK is lit, then balls are diverted across the playfield to the kickback,\nwhich sends them UP INTO the Lock. If JACKPOT is lit (during a multiball) then\nthe ball is also diverted across the playfield. If in Vault multiball, the\nball is sent up into the lock, then released. If in Token Multiball, the ball\nis returned to the right flipper. Also, if the lock is full (two balls locked)\nand LOCK is lit, the ball is also returned to the flipper. Also also - here's a\nnice example of the logic put into the software - if the Main Bank entrance is\nNOT lit for entry, and the Yellow Drop Targets are lit to open another\nentrance, the game will divert the ball to the lower right flipper, for an\neasy shot to the drop targets.\n[2.3.09] Top Lanes:Labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', passing through a lane lights\nthe associated letter. Flipper buttons move the lit letter. The center lane\n(B) ends in a scoop, which will either send the ball into the pop bumpers, or\ninto the Roof Entrance if it's lit. Completing all three lanes add 5 minutes\nto your game time, or 1 donut if in Sudden Death. Completing them also advance\nthe cellar award.\n[2.3.10] Roof Entrance:Built over the Ramp and the Cellar Entrance, when lit\nfor entry, the ball will be kicked up into a habitrail and over, down below\nthe playfield.\n[2.3.11] Jets:Three (White, Red, Orange) pop bumpers. Don't confuse these\nwith ordinary pop bumpers, however, because they have:\n[2.3.12] White, Red, and Orange Drop Targets:Sets of three, positioned around\nthe three pop bumpers. Completing the set closest to the pop bumper will\nadvance the pop bumper's scoring. (Yellow advance White Jet, Red advance Red\nJet, White advance Yellow Jet.) If LOCK is not lit, one or more sets of\ntargets will be flashing. Complete all flashing targets to lite LOCK.\n[2.3.13] Lock Release:When a ball is locked, it's shot up into the lock (see\nthe Ramp, above). When you start multiball, the balls are released into the\nPop Bumper area. If awarded a jackpot, the ball is immediately released back\ninto play.\n[2.3.14] Right Loop:Not really a loop, but balls launched into play are shot\nup this ramp to the Top Lanes. Balls that do not make it up all the way can\nroll down and get deflected to the Upper Right Flipper Return.\n[2.3.15] Bank Entrance:This is the Main Entrance. Similar to 'The Chair' in\nThe Addams Family, it's a scoop with a plastic bank mounted above it. The bank\nhas two lights - red and yellow. If the yellow light is flashing, it will award\none of two things: If you have an uncollected Wheel Award, you will be awarded\nthat. Otherwise, the left inlane was hit, and a visit to the teller lady will\nbe awarded. If the red light is lit, then the Entrance is open to start (or\ncontinue) the Board Game.\n[2.3.16] Upper Right Flipper:This flipper IS the same small size as the upper\nleft flippers on Twilight Zone and Addams Family. The lane right above it is\nthe Return Lane. When the ball rolls through there, it will temporarily light\nthe spinning disc for a Wheel Award.\n[2.3.17] Right Lanes:Same as left lanes. Light for the inlane is 'Lite 2\nDonuts' and the outlane is 'Extra Time'. The 'Lite 2 Donuts' light is actually\na paradox, since it's the ONLY '2 Donuts' light. However, if it is LIT and the\nball rolls over it, it will start flashing. You have a limited amount of time\nwhile it's flashing to shoot up the ramp to collect two donuts. The 'Extra\nTime' light is the same as the other one, awarding :20.\n\n[2.4] Setting Up the Board Game:\nIn Pinball mode, you can set up your path in the bank for the easiest\nroute to the vault. The bank has three entrances: Main, Roof, and Cellar. Your\ngoal: The Vault. Once in the bank, you can only go forward, or clockwise\naround the loop. You select the number of spaces to move by stopping the\nspinning dial on the screen, and then taking whatever reward (or punishment)\nyou land on.\nWhen you Lock the first ball, one gate is opened. (The light on the\nBoard Game goes out.) Also, a number of Bank Entrances are lit. You can shoot\nfor a bank entrance, or lock another ball, which will open another gate.\nCompleting all ALARM targets will disable an alarm, starting with #1.\n(Again, the light on the board game will go out, indicating it's inactive.)\nAlso, if you were kicked out of the board game and did not reenter, any alarms\ninactive and gates open remain so. Once you break into the vault, all alarms\nare reactivated, and gates are closed.\nWhen you enter into the bank, the shortest route is always the route\nyou take. Beginning at the Bank Entrance you entered in, you go around the\nloop, and into the vault by the first open gate. (Alarms inactive have no\neffect on your path, except when you land on them.)\nAfter you reach the loop, or if you end up bribing a guard before the\nloop, the guard is notified of your presence, and starts chasing you. Like\nyou, the guard can only move clockwise around the loop. However, the guard\nrolls a die, and can move a possible of 6 spaces, as opposed to your max of 5\nspaces.\nDuring your trip through the bank, you collect your stash. You do not\nget to keep your stash until you break into the vault, and if you get kicked\nout of the board game and don't reenter when given the chance, you lose your\nstash.\nThe Board game has many different types of spots to land on: White\nspots are 'normal' spots, Yellow spots are Gates, and Red spots kick you out\nof the board.\n\n[2.5] Board Game Spots:\n\n[2.5.01] Entrances:Three main Entrances, where you begin your path to the\nVault. Correspond to which entrance you shot into during Pinball Mode.\n[2.5.02] Vault:Your goal. Adds $75k to your stash, you collect your stash and\nstart VAULT MULTIBALL, unless you have 'VAULT' spelled, in which you start\nTOKEN MULTIBALL.\n[2.5.03] '$' - ATM:Awards $20k to your stash. If you have one or more ATM\nCards, it awards $40k.\n[2.5.04] '?' - Random Award:Gives you a selection of five possible awards (or\npenalties) and a quickly moving box. Hit the flipper button to stop the box\nand collect your reward. Possible rewards:\n\n Money Bag: Adds cash to your Stash: $7k, $10k, $12k, $15k, $20k, $50k, $100k, $125k.\n Arrow: Moves you forward or backward 1-5 spaces.\n Cop Arrow: Moves the cop forward or backward 1-5 spaces.\n Time: Awards time: :05, :10, :15, or :20.\n TNT: Ends Board Game, starts TNT Multiball.\n Token: Awards Token.\n Skull & Crossbones: Ends Board Game. 'OH NO!'\n Alarm: Disables the next Alarm.\n Dog Bone: Awards a Dog Biscuit.\n 'CODE': Awards a VAULT letter.\n Key: Awards a Skeleton Key.\n Donuts: Awards Donuts: 4, 6, or 12.\n Lightening Bolt: Sends a lightening bolt around the loop. The first\nperson (you or the cop) it lands on is destroyed. You get kicked out of the\nboard game, the cop has to start over.\n Winged Shoes: YOU go flying around the loop. When you hit the\nflipper button, you slowly decrease speed and land on a spot.\n\n\n[2.5.05] Bribe Guard:You have to bribe the guard. If you have over 5 donuts,\nhe'll simply take them and leave you to your cash. If you don't, you have to\nbarter with him. Once you give him the money, the Guard is Alerted and starts\nthe board game, the money coming out of your score, not stash. If the Guard\ncatches you, you're out of the board.\n[2.5.06] Candy 2000:Access the Computer. Find a code and enter it in. Certain\ncodes awards certain things, some are obvious, and some are not. For a\nsemi-complete listing, check section [4.2].\n[2.5.07] Guard Dog:Starts the Guard Dog, Pinball mode. You are ejected from\nthe board game, back into Pinball mode. You have 20 seconds to hit ANY bank\nentrance. While you're trying to shoot the entrance, you are running around\nthe loop in the board game. Once you shoot an entrance, you stop where you\nare, and take the shortest route from your new position into the Vault. You\nkeep your stash and Bonus X is increased for getting back into the bank.\nThere are two ways to get out of having to shoot back into the board game:\nCarry a dog biscuit or if you've already defeated the dog. Either case awards\n$25k to your stash, and you get to continue. While in Pinball mode, if you\nshoot the Ramp, you start TNT Multiball. If you drain, you go on to the next\nball. (Or Game Over if in Sudden Death) Either way, you need to relight LOCK\nto get back into the bank and lose your stash. If you are in Timed Play, then\nyour timer *IS* counting down as well.\n[2.5.08] Alarms #1-#4:Landing on this spot also kicks you out into Pinball\nmode, unless the alarm is deactivated by the '?' spot award, or spelling\n'ALARM'. This Pinball mode is very similar to Guard Dog, with a few\nexceptions. You must make it into the CELLAR Entrance, and once you do you\ncollect your stash and start the board game over from the Cellar Entrance.\n[2.5.09] Teller:Same as getting the 'Lite Deposit Window' in Pinball mode,\nwith one major exception: about 50% of the time she will award you a 'Money\nBomb'. Getting a Money Bomb kicks you out of the board game, forcing you to\nrelight LOCK. A way around this is to get the 'Note To Teller' award from the\nCellar Award.\n[2.5.10] '<-->' - Run 'n Hide:I can't believe you're doing this to me! When\nyou land on this spot, your position will start randomly moving around that\narea (no more than 5 in either direction, on your path only.) Hit a flipper\nbutton, and you stop where your marker is, getting that award.\n[2.5.11] '#' - Big Find:Awards $100k to your stash.\n[2.5.12] '!' - Laser Beam:Landing on this will kick you out of the board\ngame, with no chance to get back in.\n[2.5.13] Gates:Four gates surround the Vault. Landing on this spot presents\nthe player with three gates: Two unlocked, one locked. A randomly moving box\nis stopped by a flipper button. If the player stops on an unlocked gate, the\nboard game continues. If stopped on a locked gate, the player must have a\nSkeleton Key to continue, or wind up getting kicked out of the board game.\n\n[2.6] Fun With Bonus:\nOnce your game is over, you collect your bonus. Your bonus is\nrelatively simple:\n\n Donuts: Donuts on hand are worth $5k each.\n ATM Visits: For each ATM Visit you get $10k.\n Bonus X: For each break-in into the bank, you increase your bonus\nmultiplier.\n\n[2.7] Multiplayer Games:\nOf course, up to four players can play, and you can mix and match\ntypes of games: Normal and Assault. Players rotate after each drain (unless a\nplayer is in Assault) until they are out of time. Players who's game is over\nhave their score appear dimmed on the display. If a player's game is over,\nthen the players who still have time rotate, skipping the player who's done. A\nplayer playing Assault On The Vault finishes his multiball in one turn, then\nhis bonus is counted up, and his game is over. The other players continue\ntheir normal games.\n[3] 'ASSAULT ON THE VAULT' GAME RULES\nThe fun part of the game. Dropping in a Token won from the game will\ngive you a 'Magic Credit'. Any Magic Credits on the game will be used up\nbefore normal credits, although they appear as a 'normal' credits when\ndisplayed. ('Credits: 9, Magic Credits: 3' means you have 9 total credits, the\nfirst three are Magic Credits.)\nThis mode is an all-out multiball. 90 seconds, unlimited balls, the\npoint is to get a really high score. Tokens are not awarded at all, and there\nare two main things to go for:\nBreak Into The Vault: As you play, three paths are taken from each\nentrance into the Vault. To Move these paths, hit the drop targets. Red\ntargets move the ROOF Path. Orange targets move the CELLAR Path, and White\ntargets move the MAIN Path. The Yellow Targets and the Cellar Target move ALL\nTHREE paths.\nVault Jackpot: The Vault Jackpot starts at $50k, and for each hit on\nthe Spinning Disc, raises by $10k. Shoot up the ramp to collect the Jackpot.\nOnce your time is up, you start Fun-With-Bonus:\n\n Paths: For each path space achieved, you are awarded $5k.\n Jackpots: For each Jackpot collected, you are awarded $50k.\n Assault: For each time all three paths got into the Vault, you are\nawarded a VAULT letter, and $750k.\n The bonus is then added up to your score, and the game's over.\n\n[4] OTHER STUFF\n[4.1] Cows:\nYeah, this game has 'em too. Two, possible three places I know of where they are:\n\n  Candy 2000 code: 'MOO'. Awards a VAULT Letter.\n  '?' - Random Award: A cow head. Haven't gotten it awarded yet, tho.\n  'MOO' initials: Was told that this does something, never tried it.\n\n[4.2] Candy 2000 Codes:\nA list of codes I know so far, and what they award:\n\n MNY - +$50k to your Stash\n ADG - +$50k to your Stash\n SRG - +$50k to your Stash\n MOO - VAULT Letter\n PML - VAULT Letter\n VLT - VAULT Letter\n DNT - Donuts: 4, 6, or 12\n LFT - Moves Forward 1-5 spaces\n MOV - Moves Forward 1-5 spaces\n NOT - Note To Teller\n DOG - Dog Biscuit\n MAT - Dog Biscuit\n TNT - TNT Multiball\n TOK - Token (?)\n KEY - Skeleton Key\n\n[4.3] Changes to Gameplay:\nMany things can be changed in the adjustments to alter gameplay. The\nmain ones are:\n\n Starting time can be different, defaults to :45.\n Dial Numbers (to move in Board Game) can be random or sequential.\n You can be given the option to continue the board game, or quit with\nyour stash. If you quit, you collect your current stash value and enter VAULT\nMULTIBALL, except no time is awarded, only your stash amount.\n Game can start with LOCK already lit, or LOCK lit *AND* Bank Entrances\nLit.\n\n[4.5] Thanks:\nThanks go to the following people for helping me out with some of the\nstuff. If you find anything that needs to be fixed or added, please e-mail me\nat foxtrot_@_frii.com.\n\n Mark Carter - Finding some of the Candy 2000 codes.\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Safe Cracker", "possible_shots": "Flippers, Left Lanes, Bob's Getaway, Yellow Drop Targets, Spinning Disc, Cellar Entrance, ALARM Targets, Ramp, Top Lanes, Roof Entrance, Jets, White, Red, Orange Drop Targets, Lock Release, Right Loop, Bank Entrance, Upper Right Flipper, Right Lanes", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/safecracker2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Safe Cracker", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Scared Stiff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Scared Stiff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule Sheet version 2.2\nWritten by:\nBob McCann \nDan Wilson\n\nWith Assistance From:\n\nMartijn Van Aken\n\nKeith Johnson\n\n\nNew to this version:\n- A few minor changes\nI.  Introduction\nScared Stiff is the recent release in the Bally line of pins.  It is sort\nof a follow up to the game 'Elvira & the Party Monsters' that came out a\nfew years ago.  There are many similarities between the two games, but there\nare also many differences.  Here is the list of people who brought Scared\nStiff to life:\n\n\n Design:                 Dennis Nordman, Mark Weyna\n Artwork/Design:         Greg Freres\n Software/Design:        Mike Boon, Cameron Silver\n Mechanical Engineering: Win Schilling, Bob Brown, Joe Loveday\n Sound and Music:        Paul Heitsch, Dr. Dave Zabriskie\n Dot Matrix Animation:   Adam Rhine, Brian Morris\n\n\nThis game also brings the end of an era, as this is Dennis Nordman's last\ngame for Williams/Bally.  Recent slumps in the pinball market caused Williams\nto downsize, thus resulting in the layoff of several designers including\nDennis.  At least his last game will be remembered as a good one!\nII.  Playfield Layout\nHere is the layout of the playfield, starting just above the left outlane\nand going around clockwise:\n\n\nCast a spell    Ball saver at left drain. Unlit at start of game on our\nmachine.\n3 Targets       Hit all 3 targets x number of times to light the spell.\n(first time you must hit the bank 2 times).\nLeft Loop       Can either loop ball up to Deadheads, around to the\nLaboratory, or lock ball toward Stiff in the Coffin M-ball.\nLeaper Target 1 Hit all 3 leaper targets to collect Night of the Leapers\ntale.\nLeft Ramp       Lights lock & Eye of the Boney Beast tale.\nLeaper Target 2 Hit all 3 leaper targets to collect Night of the Leapers\ntale.\nSecret Passage  Weak shot up the left loop falls in here.  Spots a tale.\nSkill Shot hole Plunge ball in here for skill shot.  Scores 250k more\neach time it is collected.\nDeadhead Lanes  Light all 3 for Return of the Deadheads tale.\nCrate           Used for Terror From the Crate tale, and can be a jackpot\nshot in certain Multiballs.\nMiddle Loop     Extra ball shot and loops ball to Deadhead Lanes.\nJet Bumpers     20 hits awards Monsters Lab tale.\nLeaper Target 3 Hit all 3 leaper targets to collect Night of the Leapers\ntale.\nRight Ramp      Lights spin spider and collects Webvalue (50k times # of web items\ncollected).  Also gives awards at certain numbers of ramp shots\n(hold bonus, light extra ball, points, etc.)\nSpin Spider Scoop ght ramp lights the right scoop to enable Spin the\nSpider, which is played in the backbox.\nRight Loop      This shot either travels up to the Crate or falls into\nthe Skill Shot Hole.\nTelepathetic Power  1 target, lights and unlites right outlane every time it\nis hit.  Random award when collected. \n\nIII.  Six Tales of Terror\nThe 6 tales are the main goal of the game.  Some of them are major point\ngetters, some aren't.\n\n\n 1)  Stiff in the Coffin multiball (3 ball panic unleashed)\n    -This is the 'regular' multiball of the game.  The left ramp lights\nlock in the left loop.  Lock 3 balls to start multiball.  When\nmultiball starts, both ramps are lit for jackpot.  Either one can be\nhit at first for a jackpot (500,000 points), and then jackpots must\nbe alternated (If you hit the left jackpot, then only the right one\nwill be lit, then hit the right one and only the left will be lit).\nHowever, hitting an unlit ramp raises the jackpot by 10k. Multiball\nends when you have less than two balls left in play.\n\n 2)  Night of the Leapers (You'll jump out of your skin)\n    -There are 3 leaper targets (2 on either side of the left ramp, 1 on\nthe left side of the right ramp).  Once you hit each one once, the\ntale is collected.  However, hitting any leaper enough times starts\nLeaper Mania, in which you have to hit a certain number of leapers\n(starts at 5) within the time limit to light an Extra Ball (or 250K\nif you have already gotten the extra ball from this).  Each leaper\nsquished scores 100k.\n\n 3)  Return of the Deadheads (See the Family Horrors)\n    -The deadheads are located in the rollover lanes at the top.  Light\nthe three lanes and the tale will be awarded. Each dead head also\nscores points, starting at 25k and increasing by 25k each time one\nis collected.\n\n 4)  Terror From the Crate (Chilling 2-ball Multiball)\n    -Hit the crate enough times to light this (Starts at 4 the first\ntime, increases by 4 for subsequent times).  The last hit will send\nthe ball into the crate and start 2-ball.  During 2-ball play just\nkeep entering the crate for jackpots (250,000 points).\n\n 5)  The Monster's Lab (Electifying Action)\n    -X number of hits (20 to start on ours) in the bumpers starts this.\nOnce started the bumpers become worth 10k.  \n\n 6)  Eyes of the Boney Beast (Beware the Hypnotic Stare)\n    -Hit the left ramp to spot one eye.  After 3 ramps, the game awards\nthe tale and the left ramp becomes worth points.\n\n\nOnce all 6 tales have been started, \"It is time to get Scared Stiff\".  Hit\nthe crate to start it up.  The game will go through the animations, and the\nthe ball will be kicked out.  The Stiff-O-Meter will light up in the middle\nof the playfield.  The object is to advance the stiff-o-meter all the way\nto the top.  There are 10 levels on the stiff-o-meter.  To advance the\nstiff-o-meter, alternating shots must be made to either ramp, and then to the\ncrate (First shot ramp, 2nd crate, 3rd ramp, 4th crate etc...).  Each shot\nscores points, 250k plus 50k more for each subsequent shot.  The last\nshot (Scared Stiff) must be made into the crate.  Once this is done it starts\nMonster Multiball, a 4-ball Multiball in which all 3 jackpots are lit (Both\nramps and the Crate) and are worth 1 million points.  Plus, 5 million points\nare awarded just for starting Monster Multiball.  Monster Multiball ends\nwhen there are less then 2 balls left.\nIV.  Spin Spider\nThe spider game is located in the backbox.  When the ball is hit into the\nlit spin spider hole, the spider starts to spin.  To stop the spider, hit\na flipper button.  Depending on where the spider is pointing, the game will\naward something.  If you land on an item that has already been awarded, you\nreceive no award.  The awards are as follows, starting with the Eye at the\ntop of the circle and moving in a clockwise fashion:\n\n\nEye             All 3 eyes lights Extra Ball.\nSkull           Spots a deadhead lane.\nLight Jackpot   Lights the left ramp for a 250k jackpot.\nDouble Trouble  For 20 seconds, every shot's value is doubled.\nEye             All 3 eyes lights Extra Ball.\nScary guy (?)   Beat the Crate mode.  Hit the crate to collect the value\nmultiplied by the number on the Stiff-O-Meter (which goes\nup and down during the mode).  \nCoffin          If coffin lock is lit this will lock a ball, if it is not\nlit then this lights it.  Also extends Coffin Multiball\n(when multiball would normally end, it is restarted\nw/ 3 balls).\nOrb             Gives a telepathetic power award.\nElectric thing  Awards some bumper hits towards getting the Monsters Lab.\nOrb             Gives a telepathetic power award.\nBoogie Man      Starts up Boogie Man Boogie.  All shots score 10k to start,\nthe value increases by 5k whenever the ball goes into a\nsink hole.\nCrate           Just like hitting the crate once, and extends Crate Multiball.\n(When multiball would normally end, it is restarted).\nEye             All 3 eyes lights Extra Ball.\nLeaper          Starts Leaper Mania.\nBoney Beast     Left ramp lights for a hurry up value, which starts at 200k.\nSkull           Spots a deadhead lane.\n\n\nIf you light all of the awards, Spider Mania starts.  The spider wheel spins,\nand starts stopping on each award.  Every time it stops, it awards points and\nlights up everything it lands on, essentially lighting everything on the\nplayfield.  Then it starts a 4 ball multiball.  Everything on the playfield\nis lit, including all 3 Jackpots (which are doubled due to the wheel lighting\nDouble Trouble), Boogie Mania, Extra Ball, and everything else.  This ends\nonce you have less than two balls.  There is a possiblity to score HUGE points\nduring this mode.\nV.  Misc Stuff\n\n There is a cow in the game.  One of the deadheads is called Meat Head, and\nis a picture of a cow which then moo's.\n\n Just like the original, Scared Stiff stars the voice of Elvira as herself.\n\n The last person to collect all of the spider awards becomes the new\n\"Spider Champion\" in the high score list, recoreded with their initials and\nthe date and time that they did it.\n\n Elvira's daugter appears on the backglass.  Near the bottom, there is a\nbox that says Lil' Luna Green Cheese, Lil' Luna is actually Elvira's two\nyear old daughter.  It has also been said that the Scary Guy in the spider\ngame bears a resemblence to Elvira's husband.\n\nVI.

Scared Stiff\nis most likely a trademark of Williams/Bally and as such is none of my\nconcern. Elvira - Mistress of the Dark is most likely copyrighted by whatever\ncable T.V station the show appears on. Just imagine tm after each word\nand we should be fine. This rulesheet is essentially freeware and may be\nused in any manner just as long as my name and the names of any contributors\nremains intact.\n\nThe Story So Far\nScared Stiff was the last Bally machine released in 1996. Although the\ngame was available in some locations in the U.S as early as November, it\ndidn't appear in Australia until just before the end of the year. The wait\nwas worth it in the end.\n\nSpecial Note\n\nBob McCann and Dan Wilson have already posted several versions of a\nScared Stiff sheet at Bob's website \"The Temple of Pinball\". This sheet\nis not a copy of their sheet although I have read it. As the subject matter\nis the same there will be similarities to their sheet, especially in the\nlayout of the playfield. This can't be avoided and so I shall be listing\nall contributors to Bob and Dan's sheet in this document. I just had to\nwrite about this game in detail as it has me seriously addicted to it.\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nStarting at the drain and going clockwise as usual:\nFlippers: 2 standard length flippers. The tops are made to look\nlike bones.\nSlingshots: Normal size and shape. Above the kickers are rubber\nBoogie Men.\nInlanes: Normal. Nothing special here.\nOutlanes: The left outlane can be lit for Cast a Spell. This\nwas once a kickback but this was removed from production versions. This\nis now a drain save. the right outlane can be lit for Telepathetic Power.\nCast a Spell targets: 3 targets above the left outlane. Lighting\nall 3 twice lights the left outlane. Can also give a 100k spell bonus.\nCoffin: The exit from the lock. Feeds to the left inlane.\nLeft Orbit: Feeds to either the deadheads or the jet bumpers.\nWhen lock is lit a diverter sends the ball under the left ramp to be locked.\nSecret Passage: A switch at the top of the orbit. A weak shot\nwill fall in here and spot a tale. This can also spot a level on the Stiff-O-Meter\nin Scared Stiff mode.\nLeft Ramp: Steep ramp which feeds to the right inlane. Also called\nthe Beast ramp.\nLeaper Targets: 3 metal plates with plastic frogs above them.\n1 each side of the left ramp and 1 on the left side of the right ramp.\nDeadhead Lanes: 3 rollover lanes. Each one spots a deadhead.\nDeadheads are worth 50k+50k per deadhead lit with no limit known.\nSkill Shot Hole: Plunge the ball in here for 250k+250k per shot.\nBalls from the deadheads and the crate exit here.\nThe Crate: Used during Terror from the Crate and Scared Stiff\nmodes.\nExtra Ball Lane: Collects EB when lit. Feeds to the deadheads.\nMonsters Lab: The bumper area. Can only be shot via the left\norbit when lit or a strange bounce from the right lane.\nRight Ramp: Lights the spider hole. This ramp counts up to awards\n(like bear kicks). The awards are: Hold Bonus at 3, Light EB at between\n5 and 12, Light EB at 30. Shots to the ramp are worth 25k. Repeat shots\nare worth 100k for the 2nd shot and an extra 50k for each shot after up\nto a maximum of 450k. This value resets to 25k if you miss. Feeds the left\ninlane. The ramp count maxes out at 99, but there is no bonus for reaching\nthat level.\nSpider Hole: Spins the Spider when lit.\nRight Lane: Totally worthless lane. Feeds to the crate or the\nskill shot hole.\nTelepathetic Target: Similar position to the relight kickback\non Corvette but angled towards the middle of the playfield. Each hit turns\nthe right outlane on or off.\nPlunger: A manual plunger but can also autolaunch.\nSpider: A big hairy spider in the backbox.\n\nRules\n\nThe object is to complete the 6 tales of terror then advance the Stiff-O-Meter\nto level 10 (Scared Stiff). The tales are not modes, more like tasks. Any\ntale can be lit at any time except for the multiball tales which can\u2019t\nrun at the same time as each other.\nThe tales are:\nThe Monster's Lab: 20 hits on the bumpers lights the lab tale.\nWhen lit each bumper hit is worth 10k. This value can be increased by something.\nNight of the Leapers: 1 hit on each leaper target lights the\ntale. Also 20 hits on the leaper targets starts Leaper Mania. You have\n20 seconds to hit 5 leapers. Completing this lights EB for the first time\nand awards 250k each time after.\nReturn of the Deadheads: Light all 3 deadhead lanes to light\nthe tale. After lighting the tale lighting the 3 deadheads advances the\nbonus X. An EB is lit after reaching a bonus X value between 5X and 12X.\nEye of the Boney Beast: 3 shots to the left ramp lights the tale.\nThis ramp also lights the lock. 1 ramp shot is needed for each lock on\nthe 1st multiball and an extra ramp shot is needed for each subsequent\nmultiball up to a maximum of 5 ramps per lock. If the tale is lit the ramp\nis worth 50k+50k for each consecutive shot until you miss. No limit is\nknown at this time.\nTerror from the Crate: A 2 ball multiball. Each hit to the crate\nlights 1 of 4 lights on top of the crate. Lighting all 4 allows the crate\nto be entered and starts multiball. Each shot to the crate scores 250k.\nShots to the left ramp increase the crate value. Ends when 1 ball is left\nin play. Later multiballs require more hits to light each light, up to\na maximum of 5 hits per light.\nStiff in the Coffin: 3 ball multiball. Shoot the left ramp to\nlight lock then lock the ball in the left orbit. Locking 3 balls starts\nmultiball. Both ramps are lit for jackpot. After collecting 1 jackpot the\nlit ramp alternates for each jackpot. the jackpot value starts at 500k\nand is increased by hitting the unlit ramp. ends when 1 ball is left in\nplay.\nScared Stiff: Lighting all 6 tales lights the T.V for Scared\nStiff mode. No other shots are lit. Shoot the crate to start the mode.\nThe object is to raise the Stiff-O-Meter to scared stiff (level 10). You\nraise the level by hitting either the crate or either ramp. All 3 are lit\nat the start of the mode and after the first shot, the shots alternate\nwith each hit. The last shot is always the crate. You have 30 seconds to\nmake the shots and each shot adds a few seconds to the timer. If you reach\nlevel 10, all lights go off then the game goes crazy. All lights flash\nand every popper and slingshot starts going off. The display shows rapid\nfire animation's and random quotes are played. After 10 seconds monster\nmultiball is announced. This is a 4 ball multiball with all jackpots lit\nfor repeated 1M shots. You also get 5M for starting. This ends when 1 ball\nis left in play. All tales become unlit and you start again. If you fail\nto reach level 10 when you reach Scared Stiff mode again the level starts\nfrom where you left off before.\n\nThe Spider Game\nShooting the spider hole when lit gives you a chance to play Spin the\nSpider in the backglass. The spider wheel has 14 awards and the aim is\nto stop the spider on the unlit awards. Each award can only be collected\nonce so if you stop on the same award twice, too bad. The awards are:\nEyeballs: Light all 3 to light EB.\nDeadheads: 2 of them. Each one spots a deadhead lane.\nLight Jackpot: Lights the left ramp for jackpot.\nDouble Trouble: All scoring doubled for 20 seconds.\nScared Weird Little Guy: Beat the crate mode. All shots to the\ncrate score 25k* the stiff-o-meter value which is going up and down. The\nmode lasts 20 seconds.\nCoffin: Lights a lock or awards lock if it is already lit. Also\nextends the crate multiball. When 2 or more balls drain, multiball is restarted.\nCrystal Balls: Awards telepathetic power. Some awards are:\nLight EB\n250k\n500k\nLight Lock\nSpot Skull (deadhead)\nBoogie Man Boogie\nAdvance bonus X\nMonster's Lab: Spots 10 bumper hits.\nBoogie Man: Boogie man boogie mode. Frenzy mode with each switch\nscoring 10k. Each Sinkhole raises the switch value by 5k. The mode ends\nafter 20 seconds.\nCrate: Spots 1 hit towards terror from the crate. Also extends\ncrate multiball.\nLeaper: Starts leaper mania.\nBoney Beast: Hurry-up. Shoot the left ramp to collect. Value\nstarts at 200k.\nLighting all 14 awards starts Spider Mania. This is a 4 ball multiball\nwith everything lit. The spider goes around the wheel spotting all the\nawards. The 2 crystal balls give a telepathetic special, locking a ball\nscores 500k, deadheads and bumpers score 100k per hit. The mode ends when\n1 ball is left in play. The initials of the last person to play spider\nmania are displayed in attract mode with the date and time it happened.\n\nTips and Strategies\nI tend to ignore the skill shot. I always try to plunge the ball into\nthe spider hole instead. If you miss the hole and the ball doesn't hit\nanything you can relaunch the ball indefinitely.\nThere is a setting which causes the ball to be autolaunched after a\nball is locked. If you are quick you can plunge the ball yourself and try\nfor the spider hole.\nIf you can't hit the spider hole consistently, try shooting to the bumpers\nand landing in the spider hole that way. A bank shot off the crate sometimes\ngoes down there but it's a lot more prone to SDTM drains.\nI usually extend the coffin multiball first then go for the eyeballs\nfor EB. After that I just take anything, although double trouble is good\nto have during multiball. During multiball, try to keep 1 ball looping\nthe right ramp to light the EB's.\n\nRandom Notes\nNot a lot to say really. This is quite a good game but good players\nwill find it a little too easy on the normal settings. If a location has\na few good players, the game times will go through the roof and the operator\nmay be forced to turn up the difficulty level.\n\nEaster Eggs\nOccasionally when you shoot the spider hole, the display will show a\nnumber 3 running around the web instead of a spider. if you press the start\nbutton 3 times you get two picks from the spider instead of one. Choose\nwisely.\nThe programmers have hidden some of their birthdays in the software.\nThis also happens on The Machine: Bride of Pinbot. On certain dates when\nyou turn the game on you hear a fanfare and the display shows a happy birthday\nmessage. The 2 dates known at this time are:\nTania 12/5 and Alan 2/22\n\nThere is a cow!! One of the deadheads is a cow called Meathead.\nThere is also an occurance of DOHO. In attract mode during the Elvira\u2019s\nFavourite Stiffs table DOHO will sometimes be displayed as the lowest name\non the list.\n\nBragging\nHigh score so far : 136M.\n10 extra balls and a game time of over 45 minutes.\nOn a 5 ball machine with 1 buy-in I managed a score of 204M.\n\nThanks To\n\nChris Bonney chrisb@enternet.com.au\nBob McCann mccannr1@pilot.msu.edu\nDan Wilson wilso142@pilot.msu.edu\nMartijn Van Aken nfv@globalxs.nl\nKeith Johnson keefer@access.digex.net\nBruce Clark sixophone@netreach.net\nIf anyone wants to send any additions, corrections, insults etc send\nthem to me via chrisb@enternet.com.au\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Scared Stiff", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/scaredstiff2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Scared Stiff", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

The first few games you\nprobably won't like much. Then, for some reason, you'll play it again. While\nplaying, it won't seem like much; but after you've stopped you'll want to\nplay more. Then, before you know it, you'll be hooked!\n\nThis game has one of the beefiest sound systems I've heard in an arcade.\nIf you thought STTNG was good, hold on to your hats. The sound on this\nis just amazing. One problem is that it's way too quiet, we have it on\nabout 20 while other DCS games are 14-15, while the old WPC sound games\nget by on 8!\n\nThe animation is as good as the sound. Especially the start of multiball,\nand the super jackpots. Both are truly unparalleled in any other pinball\nI have ever seen, no matter how big the display is!\n\nThe toys are good. The lock magnet is of course the most wholly\nremarkable thing in the whole of the known universe. Then there's the\nmini-playfield, personally I think this will be more trouble then it's\nworth; although other players seem to like it.\n\nA few other things to note, the Side Saucer is not one of the pissy\nlittle ones WMS likes to use. It is more like the lock holes in Dr Who.\nThe Side Saucer seems to hold 99% of the balls, some still bounce out,\n(the same is true for the Battle Field popper).\n\nThe Poppers also use mechanical switches which I find odd. Although I\nHATE optos, I think they work well on poppers. However, Shadow uses\nmicro-switches, rather then leaf switches (which is what poppers used\nbefore optos became so common, and the leaf switches were awful).\n\nThe game plays really well. The drains are OK, but nothing to write\nhome about. The shots blend well together, and when you get in the groove,\nthe game is just fantastic.\n\nThe replay animation is great. Two bullets go screaming towards each\nother. First you see the left one, then the right, and finally they collide\nwith a bang (err, a thwak). When the smoke clears, the display says REPLAY!\n\nWell done to the whole team on this. After playing it, I want to go and\nsee the movie. This wasn't true of Demo Man, TAF or any other movie based\nmachine.\n\nThings to Fix\n\nThis is a list of things that could improve the game:\n\n\n In multiplayer games after locking a ball, there needs to be a nice big\nwarning to tell the player the ball will come out of the lock.\n\n In multiplayer games after locking a ball, the player should get a\nchance at a skill shot. Just make it that they have to shoot the\nShadow Loop, or Side Saucer to collect it. Still use the left blue\nbutton to select the award.\n\n Something MUST be done about the lower exit from the Battle Field. Balls\nkeep getting lost, or stuck etc.\n\n Multiball restart is really needed.\n\n A ball-saver after locking balls is needed, especially when the ball\nis ejected from the lock.\n\n Starting Vengeance from a skill shot should award the right ring on\nthe left ramp (ie: the actual skill shot), so you don't need to\nshoot it again in Vengeance. I know it'll make Vengeance easier, but\nwill improve the flow of the game IMHO.\n\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nDescription\n\nI'll start at the bottom, and go in a clockwise direction.\n\n\nLower Flippers  Standard white full length flippers.\n\nSlingshots  Standard (non trapezoid :-) ) slingshots.\n\nIn/Out lanes  A letter in the word \"KHAN\" appears at the top of each lane.\nIt operates as like standard Bonus X lanes. Complete KHAN to increase\nthe bonus multiplier. It will also light Khan Multiball at the side\nsaucer if it is not already lit. There is no kickback.\n\nLeft Mongol targets  The M and O targets are in a similar position to the\nTurbo Boost targets in Corvette. See the section 'Mongol' for more\ninformation.\n\nLeft Orbit  Standard left orbit that is not as hard as the one in STTNG,\nand not as easy as the one in Corvette. It is an Arrow Shot, Jackpot\nShot, and the Hurry Up Shot. The orbit feeds the upper right flipper.\n\nLeft Ramp  Steep metal ramp in the same place as the Time Rift targets on\nSTTNG. The ramp splits into 2, with a player controlled diverter. This\ndiverter is controlled with the left blue button, which is located next\nto the left flipper button. The ball can be fed to the left or right\nin-lane. This is an Arrow Shot, Jackpot Shot and the Skill Shot.\n\nCenter moNGol targets  The N and G targets are on each side of the left\nramp entrance. See the section 'Mongol' for more information.\n\nSide Loop  Called the Shadow Loop, it's a small orbit that is only\nhittable from the upper flipper (very much like Getaway). It joins\nthe left orbit to feed the upper flipper. See the section 'Shadow Loop'\nin the rule sheet for more information. This is an Arrow Shot, and\nJackpot Shot. The side loop goes around the Battle Field lane, and\nLock. Most of it is under the mini-playfield.\n\nSide Saucer  Just below the side loop. This saucer is shot by the upper\nflipper. It awards a super jackpot (Shadow Multiball only), and starts\nKhan multiball. When Khan Multiball is not lit, this saucer will start\nthe currently flashing scene (if Start Scene is lit), or start Final\nBattle (if it is lit). You can also put a ball here during multiball to\ndouble or triple jackpots. See the sections for Shadow multiball, and\nKhan multiball for more information. It is a saucer like the ones in\nDr Who (locks), NOT like the one in Indiana Jones.\n\nBattle Field  In a similar position to the Alpha Quadrant (center) ramp\non STTNG (but a little closer to the flippers) is a small lane leading\nto a popper. It has a drop target in front. Knock down the drop target\n(may be more then once) to Open the Battle Field. Shoot the popper and\nthe ball will be popped to the mini-playfield. This is easiest from the\nlower right flipper. Backhanding it from the lower left is possible,\nand some people can actually get it from the upper flipper too. See the\nBattle Field for more information.  This is an Arrow Shot and a Jackpot\nShot. Note, the ball bounces out of the popper quite often, and usually\ndrains.\n\nYellow Target  Solitary stand-up target in a similar position to the clock\ntarget on Twilight Zone. This target will spot letters in Mongol. Each\ntime Mongol is completed, an extra hit on the target it necessary to\nspot a Mongol letter. The white inlay next to the target will flash\nwhen it is ready to spot a letter.\n\nThe Wall  An up/down target that blocks the lock. It is very much like a\ndrop target, except it only pops up/down when the machine tells it. Hit\nit to light lock, and lock balls. This is in a similar position as the\nDisaster Drop target on White Water. (Note: A 'hit' on this target is\nregistered by an opto slightly in front of it)\n\nThe Sanctum  The coolest ball lock on the planet. Accessible only when the\nWall is down. Lock balls here for the Shadow Multiball. See that\nsection for more information. This (including the Wall) is an Arrow\nShot.\n\nNOTE: The Wall and the Sanctum are essentially the same shot. They can be\nconsidered the same unless stated otherwise....\n\nRight Ramp  Steep metal ramp (like the right ramp on Twilight Zone) in a\nsimilar position to the right ramp on STTNG.  Like the left ramp it\nsplits into two, with a player-controlled diverter.  The diverter is\ncontrolled by the right blue button, which is next to the right flipper\nbutton. The ramp can feed to the left or right inlane. This is an Arrow\nShot and Jackpot Shot.\n\nStart Scene  A saucer at the end of a short lane (exactly like Getaway). It\nawards Who Knows, Extra Ball, starts a Scene, and starts Final Battle.\nIt is also an Arrow Shot, and generally an all 'round nice guy... The\nactual saucer is like the Skill Shot one on TAF. Sometimes, an odd shot\nto the right orbit will bounce into this hole (like on Getaway).\n\nRight Orbit  Standard orbit that is very similar to STTNG, Corvette,\nGetaway, etc. Balls put here will come out of the left orbit to the\nlower left flipper. Slow balls will dribble out of the side loop. This\nis an Arrow Shot and Hurry Up Shot.\n\nUpper Flipper  Same as Getaway, Star Trek etc.. Use it to shoot the Side\nLoop, Side Saucer, or the Battle Field .. actually it seems to be the\nsafest way to knock that drop target down.\n\nRight mongOL targets  The O and L targets are directly opposite the M and O\nones. See the section on 'Mongol' for more information.\n\nPlunger  Autoplunger, fired with a trigger similar to Indi's.\n\nBattle Field  Think Path Of Adventure from Indi, and you're close. It's in\nthe same place, but it's more square. There are 4 beefy looking yellow\ndrop targets down the back, and 4 stand-up targets on each side (well,\nthe right only has three!) A bat at the bottom is controlled by the\nflippers (side to side) and when the ball hits it, the bat pushes it\naway, (think Brick Out..) The object is to score enough hits, complete\nthe playfield, and defeat Khan. If you miss, the ball falls off the\nbottom, and will probably get stuck somewhere. If you succeed, the\nball will be fed to the upper flipper. More information in the Rules\nsection.\n\n\nArrow Shots\n\nMost of the major shots in this game are Arrow Shots:\nLeft Orbit, Left Ramp, Battle Field, Wall (Sanctum), Right Ramp, Start\nScene, Right Orbit, Side Loop.\n\nJackpot Shots\n\nSome of the major shots in this game can be lit for a jackpot:\nLeft Orbit, Left Ramp, Battle Field, Right Ramp, Side Loop.\n\nThe Cabinet\n\nThe Shadow is a 5 ball game, in a standard (narrow body) cabinet.\n\nNext to each flipper button (red), is a blue button. The left blue button\ncontrols the left ramp diverter, and the right blue button does the same for\nthe right ramp. Pressing a blue button toggles the way the ball will be\ndiverted. When the diverters move, they make a really cool (and loud)\ncrunch noise..\n\nThe game is equipped with an autoplunger that is fired with a trigger\nmuch like the gun on Indi (well this is more like a slightly beefed up\nversion). Plunged balls are fed to the lower right flipper. During the\ngame, pulling the trigger will usually play an empty gun click sound.\n\nThere are no plastic ramps anywhere (well there's a little one up the\ntop .. but I won't include that here..). The ramps feed gold wire-forms\nthat stick mainly to the side of the playfield. They really don't stand\nout much, which I like.\n\nThe extra ball button is mounted on the cabinet below the gun, and is\norange.\n\nThe artwork is amazing, especially the side of the machine. The backglass\nart is ok, better then STTNG and Demo Man, but not up there with Twilight.\n\nOn the playfield are three really cool knight figures, they're not all\nthat important, but I like them!\n\nThere are no under-playfield tunnels, which means no kickouts. This is\nyet another similarity with Getaway.\n\nThe outlanes are fine, better then any Bally/Williams machine this year.\nThere is rubber everywhere, and the posts on our machine were right down\nwhen we got it. Even still, there are no shots on the game that cause the\nball to go screaming down a side drain. This is a GOOD MOVE!\n\nThe center drain is about average. The only shot that often went SDTM was\na failed left ramp. Sometimes (not all that often) a direct shot at the wall,\nor the Battle Field drop target flew down the drain. There is an operator\nadjustment for this, see Feature Adjustments number 11.\n\nRules\n\nScenes\n\nThe modes this game are called scenes. They do not run concurrently, but\nany running mode will continue during multiball. During a mode you can\nstart all other game features. Totals from each scene are added during\nthe bonus count.\n\nDuring the opening animation of any scene (except Hotel, and Duel of\nWills), pulling the trigger will play some duck quacks, and the quote\n\"Anyone for Peking Duck?\". The same thing is true when you get the 2 Million\nScene Bonus. For more information, see the section Secret Laugh Mode.\n\nThe scenes are displayed in the middle of the playfield, lit ones have\nbeen played, blank ones haven't, and the flashing one will be started\nnext. Shoot the ramps to change the currently flashing scene. Divert the\nball left to move the flashing scene up, divert the ball right to move\nthe flashing scene down. 'up' and 'down' refer to the way I have\nlisted them below.\n\nThe scenes are:\n\n   Punish the Guilty\n   Farley Claymore\n   Duel of Wills\n   The Beryllium Sphere\n   Escape Underwater Doom\n   Discover Hotel Monolith\n\n\nThey cycle in a loop, so down from Discover Hotel Monolith is Punish the\nGuilty, and up from Punish The Guilty is, obviously, Discover Hotel\nMonolith.\n\nThere is NO wizard award for completing all scenes. However there IS a\nwizard award...\n\nStart Scenes at Start Scene (duh!) or the Side Saucer (only if Khan\nMultiball isn't lit). Start Scene is always lit if not in a scene, and not\nin multiball. Shooting Start Scene, (or the Side Saucer if Khan isn't lit)\nduring a scene, will award 2 Million as a Scene Bonus.\n\n\n Punish the Guilty  A 30 second mode where you have to shoot the lit\narrows to save Tam. Three arrow shots will be lit (Left Orbit, Side\nLoop, and Right Orbit). Each shot awards 10 million. Once all three\nhave been hit, shoot Start Scene to collect 30 Million.\n\n Farley Claymore  Remember Q's Challenge?! A 30 second mode where you\nhave to beat up Farley (trust me, he deserves it!). The display shows\nthe Hit-O-Meter, which is full at the start of the mode. Every arrow\n(except the side loop and the Wall) is lit, and each one deducts a bit\nfrom the H-O-M. The mode ends when the timer expires, or the H-O-M is\nempty, about 5 or 6 shots. Not sure on the value per shot.  NOTE: If the\nBattle Field is lit during this mode, shoot it. Every hit on the Battle\nField reduces the Hit-O-Meter as well.\n\n Duel of Wills  A great video mode. Dodge the falling Phurba's to get\npoints, or the Extra Ball. Point values start at 1 Million, after a\nfew it becomes 3 Million, then 4 etc. It can actually get quite hard.\nPull the trigger during this mode to clear the screen and leave it\nclear for a few seconds. Beware though, as the Phurba's return in bulk,\nand moving fast.\n\n The Beryllium Sphere  You have 30 seconds to defuse a bomb. Each arrow\ncuts a wire. The first shot is worth 10 mill, then 12, 14 etc. Arrows\ndo not remain lit after they have been hit, (ie: you can only hit each\nshot once.) You must cut six wires (therefore, make 6 shots); if you do\nit, shoot Start Scene for 30 Million.\n\n Escape Under Water Doom  Hurry up that counts down from 30 million. Shoot\nthe lit shot to collect the current value. It will continue to count\ndown, and another shot will light. The shots light in the following\norder:\n\n Left Ramp and Right Ramp\n Left Orbit\n Shadow Loop\n Left Ramp\n\nWhen all have been collected, Start Scene will light, shoot it to\ncomplete the mode for 30 million.\n\n Discover Hotel Monolith  This is a cool two ball multiball. It\ncontinues until less then two balls remain in play. Hit the wall to\nreveal the hotel (3 hits). The first two hits award 10 million, the\nthird hit is worth 20 million, and the wall will pop down. Hit a ball\ninto the Sanctum to light all arrows. The ball(s) will be unlocked,\nand each arrow is worth one million more than the previous (the first\nis 10 million). Get them all for 30 million. All arrows relight, and\nthe value returns to 10 million. The mode ends when less then two balls\nremain in play.  It is not possible to lock balls (for Shadow Multiball)\nduring this mode, or start Khan Multiball. The display during the first\npart of this is really great.\n\n\nBattle Field\n\nThe object of the mini-playfield is to defeat Khan. To open it, hit the\ndrop target. Shoot the popper and the ball will be popped onto the mini-\nplayfield. While the ball is in the popper, pull the trigger for some\nPeking Duck. See the section \"Secret Laugh Mode\" if you want to know more.\n\nThe mini-playfield has drop targets down the back, and stand-up targets on\nthe side. When the drop targets stop popping back up, you can defeat Khan,\nthe ball will be fed to the upper flipper.\n\nOne of the most annoying things about the drop targets, is the fact that\nthe ball hits them so hard, they often don't fall down!\n\nUse the flippers to control the bat, so the ball hits it. The first\ntime you must make 30 hits (of the targets) to find Khan. Once found, knock\nthe drop targets down to break through, and defeat him. It's actually quite\nsatisfying.\n\nDefeating Khan is worth 30 million the first time you do it, and 10 million\nmore each time after. The number of hits required to defeat him goes up\nby 20 each time too, and maxes at 100. Finally, an extra hit on the drop\ntarget is necessary to open the Battle Field for every time Khan is defeated.\n\nAlso, each target has a light in front of it. If you manage to hit each\ntarget at least once, the value for defeating Khan goes up by 20 million for\neach time you do it. So if you complete all targets three times, you will\nbe awarded 60 million on top of the Khan Jackpot.\n\nRemember that hits on the mini-playfield count during the Farley Scene.\n\n[Note: A soft shot would often manage to sneak past the drop target when\nmultiple hits were necessary. In this case the machine lets you play the\nmini-playfield anyway.]\n\nShadow Multiball\n\nStarting:\n\n\n Shoot the wall to light lock. Lock one is lit at the start of the\ngame. Each multiball requires one more hit of the wall to light lock.\n\n When lock is lit, shoot the wall again to lock the ball. This is\ncool: a magnet grabs the ball, the Wall is lowered, and the ball is\nthrown into the Sanctum.\n\n On the third lock, three ball multiball begins. Watch the opening\nanimation, it is unbelievable... I have played the game plenty of\ntimes, and still go WOW at the lock sound/light/ball show!\n\n Balls are ejected one at a time from the lock to the upper flipper,\nimagine the hidden hallway from Fun House, but on the other side of\nthe playfield. Look closely as there is an orange flasher that makes\nthe balls hard to see.\n\n Since the game has an autoplunger, it is not possible to 'Steal'\nlocked balls. If there are less then three balls in the lock at the\nstart of multiball, the machine auto-plunges them. I don't like this\none bit, as auto-plunged balls are not set up for jackpots - but what\ncan you do?\n\n\nJackpots:\n\n\n The jackpot starts at 20 million. Shoot the side loop to collect.\nRemember the ball returns to the upper flipper, so multiple jackpots\nare possible, and even suggested. Balls will not be kicked out of the\nlock if you are on a 'jackpot roll'.\n\n The wall stays down during this multiball (it is only lowered after\nall three balls have been ejected from the lock). Shoot the Sanctum\nto set your-self up for jackpots. This is a great feature, it also\nreminds me a lot of White Water. Balls will not be kicked out of the\nlock if you are on a 'jackpot roll'.\n\n After 5 jackpots, the super jackpot will light at the Side Saucer.\nShot it from the upper flipper for 100 million. After each super\njackpot, 5 more regular jackpots are needed to relight it.\n\n Lock a ball in Start Scene or Side Saucer to double the regular\njackpot.  Lock a ball in both of these places to triple the regular\njackpot. Double/Triple jackpots revert to the regular value after\none jackpot, or 10 seconds, the ball(s) is/are kicked out too. Note\nthat Double Jackpot actually awards 2 jackpots, and Triple Jackpot\nawards 3.\n\n The super jackpot can only be doubled by locking a ball in Start\nScene, the 10 second timer still applies.\n\n\nShadow multiball ends when less then 2 balls remain in play.\n\nKhan Multiball\n\nStarting:\n\n\n Light Khan Multiball by completing KHAN at the in/out lanes. (Note,\neach completion of KHAN also advances Bonus X.) After a few Khan\nmultiballs, the Start Khan Multiball light times out.\n\n Khan Multiball is lit at the Side Saucer, this is not stackable.\nShoot the saucer to begin the three ball multiball. [The other two\nballs are auto-launched].\n\n\nJackpots:\n\n\n All jackpot shots start lit (not the Super Jackpot). Jackpot value\nstarts at 20 Million (per jackpot!), and the in/out lanes add 100\nthousand. See the playfield description for a list of the Jackpot\nShots.\n\n Lock a ball in Start Scene or Side Saucer to double the jackpot\nvalue. Lock a ball in both of these places to triple the jackpot\nvalue. Double/Triple jackpots revert to the regular value after one\njackpot, or 10 seconds, the ball(s) is/are kicked out too.\n\n Once all regular jackpots have been collected, then a Super Jackpot\nlights on the mini-playfield! One of the drop targets will be lit in\nturn (like the skill shot on Terminator 2), you must hit this for the\nSuper Jackpot which is worth 100 million. It's hard to control the\nbat, and keep the other 1 or 2 balls in play. The Super Jackpot can be\ndoubled/tripled in the same way as the regular one. Note: if the\nmini-playfield is disabled, it is not possible to get the Super Jackpot!\n\n\nKhan multiball ends when less then two balls remain in play.\n\nFinal Battle\n\nCAUTION: READ THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! IT MAY SPOIL THINGS FOR YOU!\n\nOn the playfield is a Scarf (near the Side Saucer). It contains four\ninlays that will light during the game. Light all four to light Final\nBattle:\n\n\n Complete Scenes - Will light when the last scene finishes, or when the\nball drains during the last scene.\n Conquer Battle Field - Defeat Khan at least once.\n Shadow Multiball - Lights when Shadow Multiball finishes.\n Khan Multiball - Lights when Khan Multiball finishes.\n\n\nWhen the scarf is complete, Final Battle will be lit at Start Scene. Shoot\nStart Scene, or the Side Saucer (if Khan is not lit) to start it.  Final\nBattle lights as soon as the scarf is complete ... yes, even during\nmultiball (although I have never managed to start it during multiball).\n\nThe sound and lights are quite hard to describe ... but it's very, very\ncool. The intro goes like this:\n\n\"Congratulations. Prepare yourself, this is the Final Battle.\"\n\nFour more balls will be launched into play (it's a five ball multiball\nwith a 30 second ball saver), and the object is to hit every shot for\n1 billion. But wait - it is always awarded this time!\n\nThe shots are:\n\n\n MONGOL targets             6 \n Left Orbit                 1 \n Left Ramp (both sides)     2 \n Side Loop                  1 \n Battle Field      4+4+3   11 \n Battle Field Drop Target   1 * \n Yellow Target              1 \n The Wall                   1 \n Right Ramp (both sides)    2 \n Right Orbit                1 \n total:                    27 \n\n\n* Spotted if the target is broken\n\nThe Side Saucer and Start Scene (if unlit) spot one target. The order is:\n\n\n  Yellow Target\n  Mongol Targets\n  Battle Field targets (anti-clockwise starting at the top left corner)\n  Arrow Shots\n\n\nThere might be a bug in here somewhere though, as the following has been\nobserved:\n\n\n   1 hits remaining.\n   0 hits remaining.\n   255 hits remaining.\n   254 hits remaining.\n   1 billion.\n\n\nI tried this on our machine and couldn't replicate the fault, so maybe it\nis caused by something else. My machine is L-2, and the one that faulted\nis also L-2.\n\nEach shot is worth 10 million. The countdown is shown on the display. Note\nthat if the drop target is busted, the machine will spot that shot for\nyou (and award the 10 million) ... so you'll only have to get 26 shots.\n\nIf the mini-playfield has been disabled, then hit the drop target to\nspot a few mini-playfield targets. God knows what happens if the drop\ntarget and the mini-playfield are broken. My guess is that no-one will\nplay that machine!\n\nAs soon as the last shot is hit, the machine goes dead: no sound, lights\nor flippers - all remaining balls drain. After a second of this comes the\nquote, \"You're FINished Khan!\" which is followed by a scream, the lights\nall come on, and a rap style collection of animations is played - topped\noff by the shot of some mirror going through Khan's head. The Billion points\nare awarded (you are actually awarded it too), with someone screaming\nONE BILLION. Following this is the quote: \"Finally you've learned to\ncontrol the pinball\".\n\nAfter the billion, all five balls are re-launched and all shots re-light\nfor another go. Note that there is no ball saver now, even if it hadn't\ntimed out, it will be turned of - cruel huh?! Final Battle ends when there\nare less then two balls left in play. The scenes all reset for another go.\n\nCompleting Final Battle (ie: getting the billion) allows you to enter\nyou initials in the list of Final Battle Immortals, at the end of the game.\nThis is better then it sounds, as the quote for getting in this list is\njust too cool to mention. If you REALLY must know, have a look in the\nEaster Eggs.\n\nVengeance\n\nOn either side of each ramp diverter is a ring. At the start of a game\nall rings will flash. When you shoot a ramp, the ring on the same side\nof the diverter that the ball went, will become solidly lit (each ring\nis worth 3 million). Complete all four rings to start possibly the\ncoolest mode since Big Foot Hot Foot: Vengeance.\n\nVengeance is a cool 30 second mode where each ring is worth 5, 7, 9, 11,\netc million. Completing all four awards 50 million, and restarts the\ntimer. There is a very friendly grace period at the end of the mode,\nso you can still score Vengeance after the sound/music has stopped.\n\nIf you start Vengeance as part of a combo (ie: the combo collects the last\nring), you start Combo Vengeance where each ramp is worth 10 million.\n\nIf, during Vengeance or Combo Vengeance, you get all rings in a row (ie:\na combo), you are awarded 100 million as a Super Vengeance.\n\nNOTE: What I have called Combo Vengeance, the machine calls Super Vengeance.\nI used the name Combo Vengeance because completing all ramps awards 50\nmillion, while Super Vengeance awards 100 million.\n\nNote that after you get the 50 million, the single ramp values continue\nto escalate. After Vengeance, all rings will start flashing again.\n\nRemember that if you start Vengeance by a skill shot, you will need to\nhit the same ramp again, it does not award the ring.\n\nMongol\n\nAround the playfield are 6 targets, each for a letter in MONGOL. These\nare the MONGOL targets. There are two above the left in/out lanes (M, O),\ntwo at the entrance of the left ramp (N, G) and two above the right In/\nOut lanes (O, L). The single yellow standup target spots letters in Mongol,\nhit it once to spot a letter; an extra hit is necessary for each time\nMongol has been completed. There is a white inlay next to this target that\nflashes when it's ready to spot a letter.\n\nSpelling Mongol starts a hurry up. Thirty million counts down, and is\ncollectible from the left or right orbit. The start of Mongol is easily\nnoticeable by the cool 'gong' sound effect.\n\nPull the trigger during the count-down to end the mode, and award 3 million\npoints.\n\n\"Find him, and kill him. All of you .. GO!\"\n\nWho Knows\n\nWho Knows is a random award lit at Start Scene by spelling Mongol. Possible\nawards are:\n\n Points (between 10-30 million)\n Light EB\n Light Khan Multiball\n Start Vengeance Mode\n Start Mongol Mode\n Bonus X\n Light Lock\n\n\nSkill Shot\n\nBefore launching any ball (not for a ball saved ball), the display shows\ntwo choices. On the left are some points (starts at 10 Million, increases by\n5 million each time and maxes out at 40 million), on the right is a real\naward. Choose between the two with the left blue button. The diverter on the\nleft ramp will flip. If the ball will go right, you'll get the award, if the\nball will go left, you will get the points. Shoot the ramp to actually collect\nit (this is what the word 'skill' means!). The good thing is that you can set\nthe diverter to the right, plunge, and get the award without waiting for the\n'Shoot Again', or 'Replay At', screens to disappear. You also don't know what\nthe award will be until you get it!\n\nThe skill shot remains lit for about 5 seconds. During this time you can\nkeep changing the left diverter to change what you want - yes, even after\nyou have plunged the ball. So what you get is basically chosen by which\nway the ball is diverted on the left ramp. Note that if you drain and the\nball is saved, the skill shot it turned off.\n\nNote: When you start Vengeance with the skill shot, remember to shoot\nthe right side of the left ramp again as that ring is not spotted for\nyou.\n\nPossible awards:\n\n  Complete Mongol\n  Start Vengeance\n  Light Lock\n  Light Extra Ball\n  Bonus X\n  Light Khan\n  5-40 Million\n\n\nCombos\n\nAccording to the audits, there are combos all over this game, right up\nto seven way combos. It is actually quite hard to hit more then three\nshots in a row and NOT get a combo. I'm not sure of the combo values, but\nthe quote is the best:\n\n\"WOW! x way combo!\" - where x is a number between 3 and 7 inclusive.\n\nI just want to know how they managed to inject so much American accent\ninto this quote!!\n\nThere are also a couple of two way combos lying around the place, but\nthey do not generate the above quote.\n\nShadow Loops\n\nThe Shadow Loop is the side loop shootable by the upper flipper. Awards\nare given for the number-of-loops-in-a-row you get. There is also a place\nin the high scores for the person who manages the most loops.\n\nWhen you shoot the loop, it remains lit for a few seconds for another\nshot. When it's lit, you get an increasing 2 million (starts at 2 million)\nuntil you miss. Then it reverts back to 2 million.\n\n\n Light Extra Ball           3 loops in a row\n Shadow Bonus (40 Million)  5 loops in a row\n\n\nThese awards are not set in stone, they both reflex. I have seen extra balls\nat 2 loops, and once at 7!\n\nA slow shot up any orbit will dribble out the side loop for a Secret\nPassage bonus, worth 5 million.\n\nOrbits\n\nThere are two main orbits in the game. The left one, and right one. Each\norbit is worth 1 million. Consecutive orbits are worth 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\nmillion (maxes at 32 million). Every fourth awards the following:\n\n\n 4)    China Town      5 million            \n 8)    Cobalt Club     10 million           \n 12)   Hotel Monolith  15 Million           \n 16)   Cranston Manor  20 Million           \n 20)   Mari-Tech       25 Million           \n 20+)  Super Loops     20 Million per loop. \n\n\nNumber of loops does not reset each ball.\n\nThe orbit software is really buggy. It never actually awards Mari-Tech,\nthe screen says \"Mari-Tech in (x) loops\", then just awards Cranston Manor\nagain for 20 million. This is P-1 ROMs.\n\nIt also managed to get into the good ole 255 loops until Mari-Tech. Although\nthis seems fixed in L-2 ROMs.\n\nSecret Laugh Mode\n\nIt's good to see more hidden stuff in the games. It's even better that\nwe manage to find it. ;-)\n\nThere are three duck quotes in this game, they all say the same thing:\n\"Any-one for Peking Duck?\"\n\nThe first time it is whispered (you have to listen very carefully to hear\nit); the second time it is said by a guy with a Chinese accent; and the\nthird time it is said by a woman.\n\nThere are many ways to get the quote:\n\n\n Pull the trigger at the start of any mode except Duel of Wills, and\nHotel.\n Pull the trigger at the end of Duel Of Wills.\n During the quote: \"I know\" (Who Knows award).\n During the Extra Ball animation.\n While getting a 'Scene Bonus 2,000,000'.\n Anytime the ball is in the Battle Field popper.\n\n\nThe trick is that you can only get the quote once from each physical\nlocation on the playfield: Side Saucer, Start Scene and the Battle Field\nPopper. Also make sure you don't have Mongol running, as pulling the\ntrigger will end that mode (awarding 3 million).\n\nTo start Laugh Mode, you must have heard the quote said by all three\npeople. The easiest way to do this is:\n\n\n Start a scene (at Start Scene), and pull the trigger.\n Shoot the Side Saucer, and if Khan is not lit, you'll get the 2M Scene\nBonus. Pull the trigger again.\n Shoot the Battle Field, and pull the trigger before the ball is popped.\n\n\nOnce you have heard all three quotes, start a scene like you normally\nwould, but instead of starting one of the regular five, the display will\nsay:\n\nYou discovered: The Secret Laugh Mode\n\nThere is also a duck (!) on the right, that quacks twice.\n\nLaugh Mode lasts thirty seconds, and the display tells you to \"Hit\nAnything\". The music is similar to Farley .. but with constant laughter,\nmixed with quacking. Shooting any arrow (they are all lit) awards 5 million,\nand the duck quacks 5 times.\n\nFor a real (ie: good, long, hard) laugh, start multiball during this mode;\nthe first time I did, myself and all the spectators were almost on the\nfloor!\n\nLaugh Mode runs like any other 'normal' scene. It is possible to lock\nballs, start Shadow/Khan multiballs, play the Battle Field, start Vengeance\netc. The only difference is that the total from Laugh Mode is added to your\nscore as soon as the mode ends, and not during the bonus count. It is only\npossible to start Laugh Mode once per game.\n\nBonus\n\nThe bonus count is mainly made up of totals from the Scenes, and it\nis not possible to speed it up.\n\nIncrease the bonus multiplier by completing KHAN on the in/out lanes. The\nmultiplier starts at 2x (for the first completion of Khan), then 3x, 4x,\n5x ... 10x. It maxes out at 10x and further completions of Khan award 10\nmillion.\n\nThe bonus multiplier only multiplies the bonus before the scene totals\nare added in.\n\nExtra Balls\n\nExtra balls can be lit the following ways:\n\n\n Lit by Skill Shot.\n Lit by Shadow Loops.\n Lit by Defeating Khan.\n Lit by Who Knows\n\n\nCollect extra balls by shooting Start Scene.\n\nOne of the items in the Video Mode is an extra ball.\n\nExtra balls can also be bought for one credit. The operator can set\nthe number of Buy In's from 1 to 3, default is 1.\n\nHigh Scores\n\nThe following high score lists exist:\n\n\n Grand Champion - Highest score, no buy-ins.\n Best Agents - Top 4 scores, no buy-ins.\n Buy-In Grand Champion - Highest score with at least one buy-in.\n Buy-In Scores - Top 4 scores with at least one buy-in.\n Final Battle Immortals - Last 10 people to complete Final Battle.\n(When the high scores are re-set there are only 4 names in this list.)\n Shadow Loop Champion - Person to achieve the most consecutive Side Loops.\n\n\nQuotes\n\nThere are some top quotes in the game:\n\n\n During Farley Scene: \"I'm not afraid of The Shadow!\"\n Start of Mongol: \"Find him, and kill him. All of you, GO!\"\n \"The sun is shining, but the ice is slippery...\"\nOr as Noel Steere would say:\n\"The Burger is warm, but the Fries are soggy!\"\n Sometimes after NOT matching: \"Coward, Chicken, Sissy ... Cummon, play\nagain!\"\n \"Vengeance is YOURS!\"\n \"Finally you've learned to control the Pinball!\"\n For a tilt: \"You still think you can control the game with brute\nforce?\"\n On the Battle Field: \"Flippers ... Use the flippers!\"\n If you don't plunge for a while: \"You are BORing me!\"\n \"Anyone for Peking duck?!\"\n Start of Khan: \"Join me, or die!\"\n Shooting a side of a ramp that has already been hit:\n\"Use the blue buttons!\"\n \"Concentrate!\"\n\n\nMisc.\n\n\n Matching is enabled by default, which is good because it's a cool\nsequence. A torch shines on a brick wall, the match number is in the\nsmall circle of light. As the torch sweeps left and right, the number\nchanges. When a match occurs, the Shadow appears and laughs.\n\n The knocker is way too quiet. I fixed ours tho ;-)\n\n\nFeature Adjustments\n\nThe following game features are adjustable by an operator. The value in\n(brackets) is the default, and the value in [square brackets] is what my\nmachine is set on if it differs from the default. When a value range is\ngiven, it is inclusive. Eg: 1-5 means the value can be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.\n\nNote: This information appears in the Shadow Manual, which is \u00a9 1994 MIDWAY\nMANUFACTURING COMPANY, manufacturers of BALLY Amusement Games.\n\n\n  Credits for a buy in (1)\nOFF, 1/2, 1\n\n  Maximum buy-ins (1)\n1, 2, 3\n\n  Attract Music (OFF)  [ON]\nOFF, ON\n\n  Attract Sound (ON)\nOFF, ON\n\n  Timed Plunger (OFF)\nOFF, 30-120 seconds \n\n  Flipper Plunger (OFF)\nOFF, ON\n\n  Ball Save timer (5)  [10]\n0-60 seconds\n\n  Shadow Multiball Ball Save timer (12)  [15]\n0-60 seconds\n\n  Khan Multiball Ball Save timer (6)  [10]\n0-60 seconds\n\n  Hotel Monolith Ball Save timer (9)  [10]\n0-60 seconds\n\n  Center hit ball save (NO)  [YES]\nNO, YES\nStarts a short ball saver (about 2 seconds) when the Battle Field\ndrop target, or the Wall is hit.

Remember that these settings are in no way fixed, and that some\nmachines may in fact not match any standard setting. Let me explain:\nWhen an Install option is carried out, all of the settings in the\nbelow table are changed to those values. Adjustments that are missing,\nare simply not altered by that particular Install operation. The factory\nsetting is of Medium Difficulty.\n\nThis is from a manual marked as 'Preliminary', so it could be totally\nwrong! I will check it when we get our first production machine.\n\nNote: This table appears in the Shadow Manual, which is \u00a9 1994 MIDWAY\nMANUFACTURING COMPANY, manufacturers of BALLY Amusement Games.\n\nAbbreviations:\n\n  Shdw = Shadow\n  MB = Multiball\n  BSave = Ball Saver\n  Secs = Seconds\n  Tmr = Timer\n  Mil = Million\n  EB = Extra Ball\n  Mem = Memory\n  U/Up = Hurry Up\n  Ex = Extra\n\n\n\n Adj #  Adjustment Description  Extra Easy  Easy  Medium  Hard  Extra Hard \n 07   Ball Saver      8 Secs    7 Secs    5 Secs    4 Secs    0 Secs   \n 08   Shdw MB BSave   15 Secs   13 Secs   12 Secs   10 Secs   0 Secs   \n 09   Khan MB BSave   8 Secs    7 Secs    5 Secs    4 Secs    0 Secs   \n 10   Hotel MB BSave  8 Secs    7 Secs    5 Secs    4 Secs    0 Secs   \n 11   Center BSave    Yes       Yes       No        No        No       \n 12   Farley Timer    40 Secs   35 Secs   30 Secs   25 Secs   20 Secs  \n 13   Punish Timer    40 Secs   35 Secs   30 Secs   25 Secs   20 Secs  \n 14   Sphere Timer    40 Secs   35 Secs   30 Secs   25 Secs   20 Secs  \n 15   Escape Start    45 Mil    40 Mil    30 Mil    25 Mil    20 Mil   \n 16   Vengeance Tmr   40 Secs   35 Secs   30 Secs   25 Secs   20 Secs  \n 17   Multi-Lock Tmr  15 Secs   12 Secs   10 Secs   8 Secs    5 Secs   \n 18   EB percentage   25%       20%       15%       10%       5%       \n 19   Mystery EB Mem  Yes       Yes       Yes       Yes       No       \n 20   Skill EB Mem    Yes       Yes       Yes       Yes       No       \n 21   Battle EB Mem   Yes       Yes       Yes       No        No       \n 22   Loop EB Mem     Yes       Yes       Yes       No        No       \n 23   Loop EB Start   2 Loops   2 Loops   3 Loops   4 Loops   5 Loops  \n 24   Khan lit mem    Yes       Yes       Yes       No        No       \n 25   Khan lit tmr    25 Secs   20 Secs   15 Secs   10 Secs   7 Secs   \n 27   Mongol H/Up     Ex Easy   Easy      Medium    Hard      Ex Hard  \n\n\nX Balls A Game\n\nThe following table lists the differences between five and three ball\nplay.

I will check it when we get our first production machine.\n\nNote: This table appears in the Shadow Manual, which is \u00a9 1994 MIDWAY\nMANUFACTURING COMPANY, manufacturers of BALLY Amusement Games.\n\nAbbreviations:\n\n  Shdw = Shadow\n  MB = Multiball\n  BSave = Ball Saver\n  Tmr = Timer\n  EB = Extra Ball\n  Mem = Memory\n\n\nAdjustments A.1 are Standard Adjustments.\nA.2 are Feature Adjustments.\n\n\n AdjNumber  AdjustmentDescription  InstallThree Ball  InstallFive Ball \n A.1 01   Balls per Game  3 Balls            5 Balls           \n A.1 07   Replay Start    500 Million        750 Million       \n A.2 07   Ball Saver      5 Seconds          4 Seconds         \n A.2 08   Shdw MB BSave   12 Seconds         10 Seconds        \n A.2 09   Khan MB BSave   5 Seconds          4 Seconds         \n A.2 10   Hotel MB BSave  5 Seconds          4 Seconds         \n A.2 15   Escape Start    30 Seconds         25 Seconds        \n A.2 16   Vengeance Tmr   30 Seconds         25 Seconds        \n A.2 17   Multi-Lock Tmr  10 Seconds         8 Seconds         \n A.2 18   EB percentage   15%                10%               \n A.2 21   Battle EB Mem   Yes                No                \n A.2 22   Loop EB Mem     Yes                No                \n A.2 23   Loop EB Start   3 Loops            4 Loops           \n A.2 24   Khan lit mem    Yes                No                \n A.2 25   Khan lit tmr    15 Seconds         10 Seconds        \n\n\nBugs\n\nJust a few glitches in an otherwise fine game:\n\n\n During Khan Multiball, when you lock a ball to double/triple the\nSuper Jackpot, the usual screen comes up with the 10 second timer,\nhowever the ball(s) are instantly kicked out, and the Jackpot value\ndoesn't change. This is fixed in L-2 ROMs.\n\n Twice during the mini-playfield test, the machine froze when the\ntest passed (I had to power cycle). It doesn't always happen though.\n(P-1 ROMs). I'm assuming that it's fixed in production roms.\n\n The display saying: '180 hits left to open Battle Field'! Fixed in L-2\nROMs.\n\n Sometimes the machine will auto-plunge two balls (only after a ball\nsave), it is a software bug that is fixed in L-2 ROMs.\n\n The orbit software is really buggy. It never actually awards Mari-Tech,\nthe screen says \"Mari-Tech in (x) loops\", then just awards Cranston\nManor again for 20 million.   (P-1 ROMs)\n\n It also managed to get into the good ole 255 loops until Mari-Tech.\nThis is fixed in L-2 ROMs.\n\n For some bizarre reason, pressing just the right flipper button will\nabort the buy-in screen. (P-1 ROMs)\n\n The ball can get stuck behind the Battle Field drop target, this is no\nreal problem as when the ball search happens the drop target is\nlowered, which causes the ball to be pushed into the popper. The usual\nBattle Field screen comes up, and the ball is popped. However, the ball\nsearch is just finishing, and although the paddle flips the ball on\nthe mini-playfield, the flipper buttons do not move the paddle. This\ncauses the machine to think the mini-playfield is broken, and disables\nit until the next slam-tilt or power cycle. This has been fixed in L-2\nROMs: when the popper detects a ball, it'll always activate the mini\nplayfield.\n\n If you shoot the Battle Field popper when the drop target is down, you\nare not awarded the arrow or jackpot. This is REALLY annoying as the\ndrop target is the same kind as STTNG, and will surly malfunction on\nsome games. This is fixed in L-2 ROMs. Oddly enough, if the drop\ntarget is dead, it will spot the arrow for you as soon as you start\nFinal Battle.\n\n Sometimes the Final Battle countdown goes past zero, to 255. I'm\nguessing that it may be caused by the Side Saucer and/or Start Scene\nnot spotting hits properly. (L-2 ROMs)\n\n The game still often thinks the mini-playfield is dead, and only a\npower-cycle or slam will get it to re-test the dam thing. What would\nbe really, really cool, would be if the mini-playfield was reset at the\nend of every game.\n\n When Who Knows awards Vengeance, the screen looks really bad. The text\n'VENGEANCE MODE' doesn't fit, and demolishes the pretty border.\n\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nJust some cool things to try when someone else is paying:\n\n\n The cow has been found! Look closely at the score display during normal\nplay, there is mist in the background that often forms The Shadow, or a\nPhurba ... very rarely it'll form a cow. 'Coolness' is not a strong\nenough word to describe it! Pull the gun trigger to get the cow to\nmooo!\n\n A duck has been found too! Much like the cow it appears in the mist\nbehind the score display. Pull the gun trigger to get it to quack!\n\n In attract mode, hit the flippers to advance to the next screen (like\nSTTNG). Hit both flippers to see the scores of the last game played.\n\n During the video mode, pull the trigger to clear the display, and keep\nit clear for a few seconds. You can only do it once per video mode, and\nbeware, when those Phurba's return, there are plenty of them, and they\nare f-a-s-t!\n\n The Secret Laugh Mode.\n\n During the Mongol hurry up, pull the trigger to end the mode, and award\n3 million.\n\n Sometimes when the ball drains down an outlane, a herd of mooing cows will\nmeander across the display - much like Black Rose.\n\n Getting your name in as a Final Battle Immortal, yields the quote:\n\"Your life is now one of purpose and honor.\"\nThis quote, I believe, is even better then the billion!\n\n\nCompensation\n\n\n If one of the ramp diverters die, the machine doesn't automatically turn\non compensation. (There is an adjustment that can be set if either\ndiverter is busted (Adjustments 29 and 30) - This must be manually\nset by the operator.)\n\n If the Wall is stuck up, hitting it will count as a lock (L-2 ROMs)\n[lighting locks is still the same]. Although the Hotel Monolith scene\nwon't work properly. Reavealing the hotel is possible, but it won't\nstart the second part.\n\n If the opto for the magnet in front of the Wall dies, the Wall will\nremain down then entire game. Shoot the Sanctum to light lock, and lock\nballs.\n\n If the mini-playfield is broken, then hitting the Battle Field drop\ntarget (when the Battle Field is lit), will simply spot a number of\nhits.\n\n If the mini-playfield is broken, there is NO way to get the super jackpot\nin Khan Multiball.\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "The Shadow", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronics", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/shadow.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: The Shadow", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Game Events\nThe player tries to score the most points and baskets while playing 4\ntimed qualifying events on the road to the finals event. Each event is\nqualified at the right ramp by completing all of its associated event\nicons (horse heads, MVP cups, Basketballs, clocks).\n\nAll flashing events begin by shooting the ramp while \"begin event\" is\nflashing. Multiple events can be active at the same time (called multimode)\nwith a single ramp shot, or a new event that is qualified while\nthe current events are being played can also be started by shooting the\nramp again.\n\nThe events are the following:\n\n\nHorse event  Complete the letters of HORSE by repeated spinner\nshots within 15 seconds. The first 4 letters score 10 baskets each,\nand the last letter awards 3 game balls and ends the event.\n\nMVP event  Shoot the center drop target as many times as possible\nwithin 15 seconds, scoring extra ball, 50M, 100M, and 300M (and\nend event) for each successive hit.\n\nGame balls event  shoot the vari-target as many times as possible\nwithin 15 seconds. Score 2 game balls for any hit and 3 game balls\nif the vari-target is driven all the way back.\n\nShot Clock event  Shoot the basket hoot once within 15 seconds.\nThe first hoop shot awards 1 game ball, starts the bottom right\nspot target flashing out, and ends the event.\n\nFinals Event  Playing all four of the above events qualifies you for\nthe finals event. Make all the strobing shots (vari-target, spinner,\nright rollover lane, right ramp, and basket) within 30 seconds.\nCompleting all shots scores the point value chosen when finals\nwas entered, which is normally 100M, but can be higher by trading\nin game balls if you have 5 or more game balls. For example,\ntrade 5 game balls to play for 300M. When time expires, the board\nis reset and the event qualification process begins again.\n\nThe first time, all event icons are lit simultaneously. After going\nthrough the finals event once, only some of the icons are lit at any\ngiven time, and the lit ones are rotated by the slingshots.\n\n3. Regular Multiball\nShooting the basket hoop while in 1-ball play (except during finals) to\nlight start-multiball on the right ramp. Shoot the right ramp to start\nmultiball, along with any events that are also flashing. Note that after\nthe first multiball, the start-multiball times out, and you must shoot the\nbasket again to re-qualify it.\n\nScore jackpots by shooting the basket or re-locking all balls on the\nright ramp. Note that a ball shot to the right ramp will be locked for 10\nseconds, then be released again.\n\nAfter scoring a jackpot, the super jackpot is lit for five seconds. Shoot\nthe basket to collect it. If the super jackpot times out, then the basket\nscores a jackpot again. Multiple super jackpots can also be scored\nconsecutively, by making baskets within 5 seconds of each other.\n\nOn normal settings, each jackpot is worth 20M, and the super jackpot\nis worth 100M. On tournament settings, the jackpot is worth 10M, and\nthe super jackpot scores 50M.\n4. Shaq Attaq Multiball\nThis is a 3-ball multiball, obtained by filling the features completed\ncircle (shown on the playfield near the free throw hole) and then\nshooting the ramp. While in Shaq Attaq, all targets score 1x basket\npoints. Shaq Attaq continues until only 1 ball remains on the playfield.\n5. Slammin Jammin\nSlammin Jammin may be obtained two ways:\n\nSpell SHAQUILLE: complete all letters of SHAQUILLE by hitting\nthe top right spot target (just above the upper right flipper), or by\nselecting the Advance SHAQUILLE award from the Tip-Off, then\nshooting Tip-Off, which will give you the choice to play Slammin\nJammin.\n\nTrade Game Balls: if you have 10 to 13 game balls, you can trade\nthem in to start Slammin Jammin. See Section 7.\n\nSlammin Jammin is a 3-ball multiball where every target adds 5M (or\n3M on hard settings, 10M on easy settings) to an end-of-ball bonus.\nThis feature remains active until 2 balls drain. You can still qualify\nevents, but you cannot start them during Slammin Jammin.\n6. Other Features\n\nMultimode  Occurs as a result of having 2 or more events active at\nthe same time. The spinner and right side rollover now score an\nadditional 1M for each active event. Multimode level 3 or greater\nlights the Level 3 lamp in the features completed circle.\n\nSupermode  Enabled when all 4 events, multiball, and Shaq Attaq\nare all active at the same time. In addition to scoring multimode as\npreviously described, the ramp scores 100M.\n\nSuper Spinner  Can only be activated after the spinner basketball\nicon has been collected. Shooting the spinner, right up-kicker, and\neither return rollover starts super spinner flashing out. Shooting\nthe spinner now scores the progressive award of 5M, 10M, and 3\nbasket points.\n\nBreak the backboard  The right return rollover starts the vari-target\nbackboard lamp flashing out. A hit on the vari-target scores a progressive\nsequence of 10M, hurry-up EB, 10 baskets, and finally 1\ngame ball for each hit for the rest of the game.\n\nAlley-oop  Enabled from the plunger skill shot or by shooting the\nramp with a lit light alley-oop lamp. The basket hoop alley-oop\nlamp begins flashing out. Shooting the hoop scores 8 baskets (5 on\nhard settings, 10 on easy settings), 1 game ball, and lights alleyoop\nin the features completed circle.\n\nPlunger Skill shot  Player will sometimes be given a choice between\nenabling alley-oop or beginning all qualified events. This is indicated\nby alternating the flashing lamps in the shooter lane while\nthe ball is sitting at the plunger. Shooting the ball will stop the\nlamp movement and give the appropriate award once the ball\nreaches the ramp.\n\nTip-off  A mystery award active during normal 1-ball play and\nenabled by shooting the left up-kicker. The player is allowed to\nchoose between a point award or some other award. In tournament\nmode, tip-off always offers the same awards.\n\n7. Game Ball Feature\nVarious features award game balls. Shooting the sequence 1, 2, 3, and\n4 will light #5. Let the ball land in the right up-kicker (between the\nupper-playfield flippers) to award a game ball, light game ball in the\nfeatures completed circle, and be given an opportunity to trade all\ngame balls collected so far for an award, as follows:\n\n\n 1 - 10M points\n 2 or 3 - Hurry-up Extra Ball\n 4 or 5 - Multiball\n 6 or 7 - Extra Ball\n 8 or 9 - Shaq Attaq\n 10 through 13 - Slammin Jammin\n\n\n14 Double Entire Score (awarded only once per player per game).\n\n15 or more: Score 20M (10M on hard/tournament settings, 30M on easy settings)\nper game ball.\n8. Hidden Features:\n5 hidden features are in the game. Discovering them lights a corresponding\nlamp and scores an end-of game bonus (or end-of-ball on\neasy settings). The hidden features are as follows:\n\n\n#1- Playing multimode level 5 or supermode.\n#2- Re-lock all balls in ramp during multiball.\n#3- Shooting free through during an event.\n#4- Tip-off: choose 5,000 twice (or three times hard settings).\n#5- Score a drop target rebound.\n\n\nThe bonus is based on total hidden features found, as follows:\n\n\n1 found - 10M\n2 found - 30M\n3 found - 100M\n4 found - 300M\n5 found - 1 Billion\n\n\nOn normal and hard settings, this bonus is collected at the end of the\ngame. On easy settings, it is scored at the end of each ball.\n\nIn order to find all five features in one game, go for multimode level 5\nimmediately, as it becomes much harder to achieve after reaching the\nfinals event for the first time. To do this, avoid shooting the right ramp\nand avoid the \"start event\" plunger shot until all four features and\nmultiball are lit at the ramp. The other hidden features can be obtained\nthrough normal game play.\n9. Scoring Level\nGrand Champion scores on Shaq Attaq typically range between 1B\nand 2B. In tournament mode, it is expected that the top A division\nplayer may score about 1B, and the average game be on the order of\n200M-400M. In the B and lower divisions, top scores will probably be\nabout 500M, with an average score around 200M.\n10. Strategy Summary\nSlammin Jammin is by far the most lucrative mode in this game.\nTherefore aim for completing SHAQUILLE, and don't trade in game\nballs until you have enough to trade in for Slammin Jammin. This is\nharder done then said, because you may have to say NO to trading in\nyour game balls for multiball or an extra ball, in order to trade them in\nlater for Slammin Jammin.\n\nThe MVP event is the most lucrative event, allowing you to score EB\nplus 450M if you hit the drop target 4 times. The Game Balls event\ncan also be lucrative, because you can collect most of the balls\nrequired to get you Slammin Jammin. The horse event and shot clock\nevent are not really all that worthwhile. Avoid starting both MVP and\nGame Balls events simultaneously, since you only have time to shoot\nfor one of them, unless you are going for hidden feature #1\n\nMultiball is worthwhile, but not necessarily big points unless you can\nconsistently shoot the basket. Try to start MVP event and multiball\ntogether, then shoot the drop target a lot.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Shaq Attaq", "possible_shots": "Upper left spot target, Left Up-kicker, Drop Targets, Spinner, Upper right spot target, Basket Hoop, Right Up-kicker, Hole kicker, Right side rollover lane, Center spot target, Lower left Vari-target, Right Ramp, Lower left spot target, Bottom right spot target", "manufacturer": "Premier Technology", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/shaqattaq.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Shaq Attaq", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Increased in\nvalue by successive ramp shots: the first increases the white bumper\nto 520 per hit, the second increases the red bumper to 520 per hit,\nand the third triggers quotes with each bumper hit. Hitting any\nbumper rotates both the currently selected Prince Charming mode and\nswamp mode through the remaining unplayed modes.\n \"Merlin\" (\"MYSTERY\")\n\nscores 10; when lit, scores a \"randomly\" selected\nvalue (see below).

When not lit, the first shot of each ball through\nthe lane scores 250K, increasing by 25K with each additional shot\nto a maximum of 500K. The lane can also be lit for Super Jackpot,\nand is also the secret Skill Shot; hitting this lane when \"SKILL\nSHOT\" is lit scores double the current Skill Shot value, and increases\nthe next Skill Shot award by 250K. The lane passes under the Donkey\nplayfield, feeding the right orbit.\n\n\"Donkey\" TARGETS\n\nwhen lit, scores the \"Donkey\" value in certain modes. Between modes,\nscore 100K for the first hit of each ball, increasing by 10K with\neach additional hit, and add 1 second to the starting time for the\nnext round of Donkey Pinball (which starts at 15 seconds).\n\nUPPER CAPTIVE BALL\n\nscores 11,040; adds a letter to \"P-I-N-B-A-L-L\".  This shot is also\nlit for a Jackpot in certain modes, and for Extra Ball, and is the\nsecond half of the \"PINBALL COMBO\", beginning with either orbit\nshot. The Combo value starts at 500K, and increases by 50K for each\nadditional combo hit; a combo starting with the right orbit (Gingy)\nscores the full Combo value, while a combo starting with the left\norbit (Puss in Boots) scores half the current Combo value.\n \n\"Fairy Godmother\" TARGET\n\nscores 10; when lit, scores a \"random\" Fairy value (see below).\n\nSWAMP\n\nwhen not lit, scores a random number of points, between 20K and\n120K. When lit (in order of priority): \"MULTIBALL\" starts Far Far\nAway Wizard Mode, \"P-I-N-B-A-L-L\" starts Donkey Pinball (on the\nmini playfield), and \"SWAMP\" starts the flashing swamp mode (or\nWizard mode).  The swamp ejects to the right flipper.\n\nLOWER CAPTIVE BALL\n\nscores 11040; adds a letter to \"P-I-N-B-A-L-L\".  This shot is also\nlit for a Jackpot in certain modes.\n\n\"Gingy\" SPINNER (RIGHT ORBIT)\n\nwhen lit, scores the \"Gingy\" value in certain modes; hitting the\nSpinner also advances toward lighting the \"Swamp\".  The first spinner\nrotation of each ball scores 1K, increasing by 50 with each additional\nrotation to a maximum of 5K.  Completing the right orbit shot exits\nthe left orbit (like the return from a Puss-in-Boots shot).\n\n\"SPECIAL\" OUTLANE\n\nscores 10; when lit, awards a Special.\n\n\"2X Fiona\" INLANE\n\nscores 10; when lit (alternating with the \"2X Gingy\" inlane, switched\nby either sling), doubles the value of the Fiona shot for a brief\ntime; feeds the right flipper.\n\n\n\"Prince Charming\" Modes\n\nThe currently selected (flashing) Prince Charming mode is rotated\nthrough the remaining un-played modes by hitting any of the three\nbumpers.  Hitting Prince Charming the indicated number of times\n(starting at 5, and increasing by 1 after each award) awards the\ncurrently flashing value:\n\n\n\"Villians\"\n\nscores 24,570 (12K prior to \"v11.0\") per villain hit so far in the\ngame. This mode does not appear to score any points whatsoever if\nit's the last of the five Prince Charming modes collected, but it\nstill does.\n \n\"3 little Pigs\"\n\nadvances the pop bumpers to their maximum point values.\n\n\"Un-Happy Hour\"\n\nfor 20 seconds, doubles the value of all scores.\n\n\"Once Upon a time\"\n\nstarts a Jackpot shot at a randomly selected character, which counts\ndown from a starting value of 3M (increasing by 1M with each\nadditional \"Once Upon a Time\" mode) to a minimum of 750K, and then\ntimes out. Hitting the selected character scores the current value.\n\n\"Dragon MULTIBALL\"\n\n2-ball multiball with a generous ball saver, with six Jackpot shots\n(Fiona, Puss in Boots, Shrek, Gingy, and both captive balls).  The\nfirst Dragon Multiball Jackpot of each game scores 250K, increasing\nby 100K with each additional Jackpot, to a maximum of 750K. Each\nJackpot hit also resets the countdown timer to 10 seconds; if the\ncountdown timer expires, one of the already hit Jackpots is relit.\nCollecting all six of the lit Jackpots at the same time turns off\nthe countdown timer, and lights the Castle Guard Jackpot lane for\nSuper Jackpot, which scores 3M, and restarts the mode. Dragon\nMultiball ends when only one ball remains on the playfield.\n\nWhen all five Prince Charming Modes are completed, they reset, and\ncan all be awarded again.\n\nSwamp Modes\n\nThe currently selected (flashing) Swamp mode is rotated through the\nremaining unplayed modes by hitting any of the three bumpers. Hitting\nthe \"Gingy\" Spinner the indicated number of times (starting at 10,\nand increasing by 5 after each award, to a maximum of 30) lights\nthe swamp to start a swamp mode. When \"swamp\" is lit, hitting the\nscoop scores 500K and starts the currently flashing mode:\n\n\"Bridge to Fiona\" (\"SHOOT SIDE SHOTS AND RAMP FOR BIG POINTS\")\n\nfor 30 seconds, each of these lit shots scores 500K, increasing by\n100K with each additional shot, to a maximum of 1M per shot.\n\n\"Dinner Theater\"\n\nwithin 30 seconds, hit each of the 6 characters once to activate\ntheir super powers. The first character hit scores 750K, increasing\nby 50K for each additional character hit, up to 1M for the final\ncharacter. Hitting all 6 character shots also scores a 1M bonus,\nfor a total mode maximum of 6.75M.\n\n\"Wrestling Match\"\n\nevery playfield switch made scores a \"hit\" on the Knight, who\nrandomly hits Shrek back. When one of the \"life\" bars under the\nShrek or the knight on the DMD reaches \"KO\", the mode ends; either\n\"Shrek WINS\" or \"knight WINS\" is displayed, along with the total\nnumber of points scored during the mode. There appears to be a point\nbonus (value unknown) for winning the fight.\n\n\"Potion Problems\"\n\nfor 30 seconds, \"any shot\" (Fiona, Puss in Boots, Shrek, Gingy, or\nthe ramp) scores 300K points, increasing by 50K each time the Donkey\ntargets are hit, to a maximum of 750K.\n\n\"Ogres are Onions\" (\"SHOOT Shrek (\"X-X-X\" TARGET BANK), Prince Charming, Puss in Boots, AND Donkey. MORE PEOPLE SCORES MORE POINTS!\")\n\nfor 30 seconds, each of these 4 character shots score points depending\non the total number of different characters hit during the course\nof the mode, as follows:\n\n 1 character - 250K per hit\n 2 characters - 500K per hit\n 3 characters - 750k per hit\n 4 characters - 1M per hit\n\n\nPress both flipper buttons together at the start of any mode to\neject the ball immediately. When all five SWAMP modes have been\ncompleted, they all stay lit, and shooting the scoop with \"SWAMP\"\nlit starts...\n\nSwamp Wizard Mode\n\nStarting this mode scores 1M (\"SWAMP BONUS\"). The starting Jackpot for the mode is then set based on what you've previously done during the entire game to that point, as follows:\n\n 250K for each SWAMP Wizard start\n 30K for each Bridge to Fiona shot\n 50K for each Dinner Theater shot\n 30K for each Wrestling Match shot\n 15K for each Potion Problems shot\n 30K for each Orges are Onions shot\n\nNOTE: beginning with \"v11.0\", the five Prince Charming mode shot counts are now reset to zero after each Swamp  Wizard mode.\n\n(\"EVERY JACKPOT INCREASES MULTIPLIER\")\n(\"SHOOT Swamp SCOOP TO RELIGHT JACKPOTS\")\n\nWhen the mode starts, all Jackpots are lit, and the Jackpot value starts counting down from the starting value computed above to 250K; when it reaches 250K, a 3-second countdown starts to the end of the mode.\n\nHitting the first Jackpot shot scores 1X the current Jackpot value, increasing by 1X with each additional Jackpot shot. During the first grouping, hitting 1 Jackpot will light the scoop, increasing by 1 with each additional grouping, to a maximum of 7 Jackpot shots required to light the scoop. Each Jackpot can only be scored once in each grouping. Hitting the Puss/Castle Guard Jackpot combo (starting with both Jackpots lit) scores double the normal value for the Castle Guard Jackpot shot.\n\nHitting the lit scoop scores the current Jackpot value, times the current multiplier. The Jackpot value is then reset to its starting value, the multiplier is reset to 1X, all Jackpots are relit, and the ball ejected to start the next grouping. (\"JACKPOT RESET / MULTIPLIERS RESET / JACKPOTS RELIT\")\n\nWhen SWAMP Wizard mode is completed, all the Swamp modes reset, and can all be awarded again.\n\nDonkey PINBALL\n\nWhen \"P-I-N-B-A-L-L\" is lit, hitting the scoop deadens the flippers on the main playfield, and activates the mini flippers on the Donkey playfield; the mini ball is launched up the right inlane to start the mode. While the \"Donkey TIME\" on the DMD counts down, the orange\nlight between the mini flippers remains lit, and any drain is relaunched; the mode ends when the mini ball drains with no time remaining.\n\nThe first shot at each character of each Donkey Pinball session scores the character's base value (100K for Fiona, 50K for all others), increasing by the base value with each additional shot.\n\nThe first character completed (3 shots for Man, 4 for Puss, 5 for all others) of each session scores 500K and increases the playfield multiplier for the rest of the ball in play, increasing by 500K for each additional completion to a maximum of 1.5M and 3X. All character\nshots score half their base value (times any playfield multiplier) after the character has been completed. The playfield multiplier resets at the start of each Donkey Pinball session.\n\nCompleting all five characters reactivates the main playfield flippers, and starts...\n\nDonkey MULTIBALL\n\nPress both flipper buttons together at the start of this mode to bypass the lengthy DMD instructions:\n\n(\"SHOOT CHARACTER SHOTS FOR JACKPOTS\")\n(\"CHARACTER JACKPOTS ALTERNATE PLAYFIELDS\")\n(\"COLLECT EACH CHARACTER 2 TIMES TO LIGHT SUPER JACKPOT\")\n(\"LIT CAPTIVE BALL SPELLS P-I-N-B-A-L-L\")\n(\"SPELL P-I-N-B-A-L-L TO ADD A BALL\")\n(\"Donkey TARGETS RECATIVATE MINI PLAYFIELD\")\n(\"LIGHT ALL CHARACTERS FOR SUPER JACKPOT\")\n\nEach character needs to be completed both on the mini playfield and on the main playfield (where all balls are launched, with a generous ball saver). The lights in front of each character on the main playfield and on the mini playfield are lit when that shot is\nqualified; the character lights above the left flipper are flashing when one of the shots for that character has been made, and on steady when both shots have been made.\n\nEach Jackpot scores 500K, plus a 100K bonus for each character already completed (?). Completing all characters lights the Castle Guard Jackpot lane for Super Jackpot. (\"SHOOT SUPER JACKPOT FOR\n2,000,000\") When the Super Jackpot is hit, all Jackpots reset; completing them all and hitting the Super Jackpot a second time in the same Donkey Multiball scores 3M. Scoring the Super Jackpot also lights Merlin for a few seconds; when lit, Merlin scores a \"TRIPLE SUPER SECRET JACKPOT\", worth triple the value of the Super Jackpot just awarded.\n\nThe mini ball is relaunched whenever the orange light between the mini flippers is lit. When time expires, hitting either of the Donkey targets on the main playfield restarts the clock (\"Donkey TARGETS\nRELAUNCH MINI-BALL\").\n\nDonkey Multiball ends when only one ball remains on the main playfield; there is a good \"grace period\" when only one ball remains in which to score additional Jackpots, or add additional balls to continue the mode.\n\nEnd of Ball Bonus\n\nThe end of ball bonus starts at 75K on the first ball, increasing by 25K on each additional ball. Added to the bonus are the following values per character shot made during the ball:\n\n Donkey - 20K\t\n Man \t- 30K\n Charm \t- 20K\n Puss \t- 5K\n Fiona \t- 10K\n Shrek \t- 10K\n\nThis total is then multiplied by the bonus multiplier accumulated during the ball to get the bonus total.\n\nFairy Godmother AWARDS\n\nHitting the lit Fairy Godmother target awards one of the following:\n\n 3 Charming HITS\n ADD-A-BALL (only awarded while a multiball mode is in progress)\n Repay Your Debt Time (only awarded while Re-pay Your Debt is in progress)\n Un-HAPPY HOUR TIME (only awarded while Un-Happy Hour is in progress)\n HURRY UP RESET (only awarded while .Once upon a Time. is in progress)\n PINBALL LETTER (only awarded when P-I-N-B-A-L-L is not already lit)\n MORE SWAMP TIME (only awarded while a Swamp mode is in progress)\n\n\nMerlin\n\nHitting the lit Merlin awards one of the following:\n\n  \t1 MILLION (\"BIG POINTS\")\n  \t2 MILLION (\"BIGGER POINTS\")\n  \tBONUS MULTIPLIER (increases by 1X)\n \tCOLLECT BONUS (just like at the end of a ball)\n  \tCastle Guard JACKPOT LIT (staying lit until you hit it)\n  \t\"Baby\" MULTIBALL (awarded more often when needed for \"Far Far Away\")\n  \tHOLD BONUS X (holds the bonus multiplier until next ball)\n  \tLIGHT EXTRA BALL\n  \tLIGHT SPECIAL (on the left outlane)\n  \tLIGHT PINBALL (on the scoop)\n  \tLIGHT SPECIAL (on the right outlane)\n  \tLIGHT Swamp MODE (on the scoop)\n  \tPOPS MAXED\n  \tRAISE BALL SAVER (between the flippers)\n  \tRAISE Pinocchio target\n  \tSPOT Character (completes one character for Donkey Pinball)\n\n\nSTART Far Far Away\n\nIn a refreshing improvement over previous Stern/PLD games, none of these awards will be given when they would be useless (for example, \"LIGHT PINBALL\" when it's already lit). One exception: you can collect \"LIGHT Swamp MODE\" if the Swamp mode is already lit but not showing, hidden behind the higher-priority \"PINBALL\" being lit on the scoop.\n\nBaby MULTIBALL\n\nTo start Baby Multiball, complete the Baby targets 3 times, increasing by 1 for each additional Baby Multiball start, to a maximum of 6; the first Baby Multiball (with a very short ball saver) starts with 2 balls, with each additional Baby Multiball starting\nwith 3 balls. The value of each Baby Multiball Jackpot is 20K times the number of switch hits required to score the jackpot, as follows:\n\n\n\n BMB session    1st    2nd    3rd & on\n\n 1st Jackpot     10     12     15\n 2nd Jackpot     12     14     18\n 3rd Jackpot     14     17     21\n 4th Jackpot     16     19     24\n 5th Jackpot     18     22     27\n 6th & on        20     25     30\n\n\nRe-Pay your Debt\n\nFor 20 seconds, lit shots score 200K times the number of Castle Guard shots made (at the front of the ramp) since the last time the .Re-pay your Debt. mode was started, to a maximum of 1M per shot.\n\nIf Re-Pay your Debt mode is started as an award from Merlin, lit shots score 400K each.\n\nFar Far Away\n\nThe final wizard mode, qualified by excelling in six of the other facets of the game. To see where you stand, hold either flipper for \"INSTANT INFO\"; the third screen shown will be the \"Far Far Away\" REQUIREMENTS, with those you have completed highlighted:\n\n \"5 CG JPS\" - 5 Castle Guard Jackpots\n \"10 Re-debt SHOTS\"-10 lit shots during repay your\n   debt mode\n \"15 Baby JPS\" - 15 Jackpots during Baby Multiball\n \"Prince Charming\" - all five Charming awards\n \"Donkey SJP\" - Super Jackpot during Donkey Multiball.\n \"Swamp WIZARD 25M\" - 25M or more points scored\n   during Swamp Wizard mode\n\nCompleting all of these requirements lights \"MULTIBALL\" on the scoop; shooting the scoop starts \"Far Far Away\".\n\nIn the first phase, played on the Donkey playfield for 18 seconds, each character shot adds 50K (Shrek and Man), 75K (Fiona and Charm) or 100K (Puss) to the starting Jackpot value of 1M (\"BUILD JACKPOT\").\nDrained balls are re-launched as long as there is time remaining; when time expires, the mini flippers are deadened immediately to end the phase.\n\nIn the second phase, played on the main playfield, all balls are launched, with a generous ball saver. Each of the lit Jackpot shots score the value earned during the first phase.\n\nWhen the ball saver has expired and only two balls remain, Merlin is lit. (\"SHOOT Merlin!\") Shooting Merlin scores 2M, and starts a 10-second timer for the scoop shot (\"SHOOT THE SWAMP!!\"). If the scoop is not hit in time, the ball in Merlin is ejected; making the shot scores 2M (\"Swamp LOCK\"), and Re-starts the first phase of \"Far Far Away\" by launching the mini ball on the Donkey playfield for another 18 seconds to build onto the existing Jackpot value. When that timer expires, the two locked balls are released to restart the second phase, and a third ball is\nlaunched, with ball saver restarted. As before, the saucer lights when only two balls remain.\n\n\"Far Far Away\" ends when only one ball remains on the main playfield.  At that point, all of the Far Far Away requirements are reset, and can all be earned again.\n\nDisclaimer, This information was borrowed from the FG pinball rulesheet and updated with several hours of cross referencing playfield and characters to make it work for The SHREK version.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: The Simpsons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 The Simpsons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis machine was released in October 1990 by Data East Pinball.\n\nAuthor: Joe B Reeves\n\nDate: 26 Feb 91\n\n\nSince I had one request, that's all I needed.\n\nThe probably-not-complete rules posting for The Simpsons (Data East)\n\nObject: Get the ever increasing jackpot. How original.\n\nThe playfield is a wide open playfield which is warped, unfortunately, to\nenter the side drains. It has 3 ball locks, two of which push the ball into a\ncatwalk leading to the flippers. It has one ramp on the left side which goes\nup and enters the machine just under the backglass and leads into the right\nflipper rollover. There are three bumpers which are shaped like nuclear\ncooling towers. There are two sets of drop targets- 3 in the middle of the\nplayfield, and a set of five on the right side on the playfield. The left\ndrain has a kick save. There are three targets on the left side just under a\nball lock. Done. Good.\n\nNow the rules.\n\n\"Plunge the ball, man.\"\nBonus Multiplier\nThe rollovers are angled like this: \\r\\r\\r\\. I don't really know why. Each\ntime you get a clear rollover, a light above the rollover lights. Each time\nyou get all three rollovers, you get a bonus +X. \"Lemme have some tickets.\"\nNuclear Towers\nQuotes: Homer: \"Bart!\" \"Why you little-!\" \"Aaaaahhhhg!\"\nBart: \"Aye Carumba!\" \"Whooooa Mama!\"\n\nEach time you hit a tower, it adds to that tower's Nuclear Power Value\nNuclear Power Value\nQuotes: Homer \"Nuclear Power Value!\"\n\nWhen a tower is flashing, its NPV is ready to be collected. Shooting the\nball into the left center or right ball lock will collect that specific NPV.\nThe left and right inside lanes will add 2000 to the NPV, and sometime make a\ntower ready to collect the NPV.\nLaser Kick (Left drain)\nQuotes: Abu: \"Come Again!\"\n\nWhile laser kick is lit, the ball will be kicked back into play. It will\nbegin flashing during which the ball could land there again and be kicked\nback into play. This happens a billion times, mainly because the drain\nopening is about 3 inches wide.\nIce Cream Targets\nQuotes: Homer: \"Chocolate\" \"Double Chocolate!\" \"Triple Chocolate!!!\"\n\nHitting all three of these targets while the laser kick is OFF will relite\nthe laser kick.\nFaces Drop Targets\nQuotes: Mrs Krabapple: \"Owwww!\"\nNelson:\"Oww!\"\nMr. Burns:\"Owwwww!\"\nSherri and Terri \"Oww!\" The same one as Nelson\nPrincipal Skinner: Does not go \"Ow.\" He goes boing. Don't know why.\n\nEach target is worth 25K. The first time you hit all five targets in one\nball, the bonus hold is lit. The second time : extra ball. The third time:\nSpecial. Each time after that: 25K doubling each time.\nBIG Value\nQuotes: Krusty: \"Hehehehe!\"\nGrandpa Simpson: Don't you know how to use flippers?\n\nWhen the ball goes down either left or right drains, a random value of 25K\n50K 75K, or 100K is awarded. Unfortunately, this loses the ball.\nBonus hold:\nNo quote:\n\nLocated in the bottom left (Considered center) ball lock, an orange light\nwill be lit when it is available. Landing it in here will take your bonus at\nthe end of the ball and add it to your next ball.\nExtra Ball:\nQuote: Bart:\"Go for the extra ball, man\" \"Shoot again, man!\"\n\nLocated in the right ball lock, a red light will be lit when available. If\nyou've earned a chance at another extra ball without getting one during the\nsame ball, the extra ball markers in the left and right drains will be lit.\nGet any of these to get the extra ball.\nSpecial:\nQuotes: Bart: \"Go for the Special!\" if extra game awarded:\"Don't have a cow,\nman!\" if extra ball\" \"Shoot again, man!\"\n\nLocated in the left ball lock, a red light will be lit to show the chance for\na special. Landing it here will give you an extra ball, or a free game, what\never the setting of the game is.\nMystery Bonus Ramp\nQuotes: Bart:\"Shoot again, man!\"- free ball \"Awesome, man!\" 5X donuts\nHomer: \"Mystery Score\" 500,000, Bonus hold + 100,000\n\nOn each new ball in play, the ability to get a mystery bonus is awarded. It\nis the red light above the ramp. The first time you hit the ramp Bart says\n\"Go for the ramp, man!\" Now you have about 7-10 seconds to hit the ramp\nagain. If you miss, there is a variety of quotes:\n\nBart: Don't have a cow, man!, or You blew it, man!\n\nMr. Burns \"Smithers, fire that man!\"\n\nIf you hit it, a mystery bonus is randomly selected from above.\n\nOther quotes:\n\nKrusty: \"Don't blame me, I didn't do it!!\" \"Who do you love?!?!?\"- upon going\nup the ramp. \"HEHEHEHE!!\" Upon falling back down the ramp.\nMILLIONS ramp\nQuotes: Bart: \"Go for the ramp, man!\"\nHomer:\"Please,please,please,please!!!\" \"One Million Smackers!!!\"\nLisa: \"Hurry up!!\"\n\nJust below the backglass is a rainbow with the letters MILLIONS. Each time a\nbonus multiplier is achieved, or every time the ball goes through the ramp, a\nmillions letter is spotted. When all letters are lit, the music starts\nplaying, and you've got a chance to make a very high score. Each time you hit\nthe ramp, one million points are awarded. You get 15 seconds to hit it as\nmany times as you can, and when you hit it and Homer says his quote, NO TIME\nIS TAKEN OFF!\nBowling Drop Targets\nQuotes: Bart: Strike! Hurry up! Lock the ball, man!\" \"Strike!\"\nHomer:\"Nice Strike!\"\n\nHitting all three targets in one ball will light the green \"Ball Lock\" lites\nin front of some or all of the ball locks. This is where multiball can be\nachieved.\n2-Ball Multiball\nQuotes: Bart: Plunge the  ball, man!\n\nHitting the ball into a lit ball lock will start 2-ball mball. Then you want\nto lock both balls. After locking the first ball, you are given a given a 14\nsecond time limit to lock the other ball into any unoccupied ball lock. The\n3-ball mball starts.\n3-ball Multiball\nQuotes: Bart: \"Plunge the ball, man!\" \"Cowabunga!\", \"Don't have a cow, man!\"\nHomer: \"JACKPOT!! Jackpot jackpot.....\"\n\nNow the real fun starts. When all three balls are in play, go for the bowling\ntargets in the center. Bart will then say \"Go for the JACKPOT!!!\" On the\nscreen, the word JACKPOT and a number is showing. On the backglass, homer is\nstanding next to a nuclear controller. The numbers 1,2,3, or 4 will be lit\naccording to the value of the jackpot. The jackpot itself grows bigger and\nbigger very quickly (from 1 mil to 4 mil) as long as a flipper is not held.\nWhen the flipper is held, the value goes down. Hit the ramp when the vale too\nhigh to pass up. At least try to. Then, lights go off, whizzers whiz, and the\nChristmas Tree on the White house lawn lights up.\nExtra Quotes:\nLisa: Go, go go!!: When the left lock is hit with no lock lit, and no special.\n\nLisa: \"Shoot it!\" Every time the ball goes through the inside right rollover.\n\nHomer: \"It's Princess Cashmere!\" Right lock hit, no Ex.Ball, no ball lock, no NPV.\n\nBart: \"El Barto was here!\" Center lock hit, no Bonus hold, no ball lock, no NPV.\n\nBart: Yooouuu tilted!!!\n\nBart: \"Hey, man, we're both underachievers!\" \"Whoooa mama!\" \"Awesome, man!\" \"Way to go, man!\" When bonus is given.\n\nBart: \"Don't have a cow, man!\"- free game during game\n\nBart: \"Whoa-Whoa mama!\" - free game after Homer's Luck Scratch N Match\n\nBart: \"You blew it, man!\" \"Awesome, man!\" \"Way to go, man!\" losing Homer's Lucky Scratch N Match\n\nBurns: \"Smithers, fire that man!\"- losing Homer's Lucky Scratch N Match\n\nI like this game a lot and I hope this helps you somewhat.\n\nPlease E-mail any responses to the way, way, way above address, and tell me\nhow I did, or what I left out.

Playing it to have a good time doesn't\nrequire too much effort, since there should always be something to do.\nPlaying it strategically takes more effort than almost every other\nmodern pin, but it sure is worth it.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet, why are you reading this?  Go play the\ngame, already.\n\n\n--- Help Me! ---\n\nAlthough thorough, this rulesheet sucks as far as being complete.  If\nyou know of things that should be here, please contact me at\nbostonpinball@comcast.net.  Most places marked with square brackets [ ]\nare areas where I feel there is incomplete information, but please\nlet me know if you find things that are dead wrong, too.\n\n\n--- Special Thanks ---\n\nThanks to Tim Showalter for his ideas on a rule sheet, and TJ Beyer\nfor his work on the list of Cletus Kids and the details on Captain's\nBounty.  Thanks to untold others for strategy tidbits and whatnots and\nwhosits.\n\n\n--- Playfield and Basic Scoring ---\n\nThis section describes, briefly, the location and basic scoring of\nshots.  See later sections for specifics on mode and multiball\nscoring.  This is roughly clockwise, from left to right.\n\n-- First, the main playfield.\n\n- Left inlane / outlane: Standard setup.  Either can be lit for\n  Extra Ball.  Inlane lights spinner on Right Orbit for 3x scoring or\n  higher.\n\n- Lite Otto standup: This target is in roughly the same position as the\n  \"G-R\" standups of Addams Family.  Hit the standup when lit, and\n  Otto's Bus Tour will light at Springfield Elementary, activating\n  timed 2x scoring on a shot.\n\n- Left (Cletus) Orbit:  Through the bumpers, around the back,\n  feeding the upper right flipper.  Adds 1 Cletus Kid, and lights the\n  Nuclear Value at the Pop Target.  See \"Cletus Kids\" and \"Nuclear\n  Value\" sections for more.\n\n- Pop Bumpers: Three, in standard arrangement.  The left pop is\n  standard, while the other two have a nuclear cooling tower that\n  \"pops\", much like Data East's 1990 Simpsons game.  Each pop\n  bumper adds between 1,000 to 5,000 to the Nuclear Value.\n\n- Pop Target: Standup target above the pop bumpers.  This target\n  is frequently hit while the ball is bouncing in the pops, and\n  can also be hit directly from the upper right flipper.  When the\n  timer is active, the Pop Target adds time (2 to 10 seconds,\n  depending on how it was hit).  See \"The Timer\" section for more.\n  The Pop Target also collects the Nuclear Value when lit.\n\n- Adv. Pops standup: This target is in roughly the position of the\n  Electric Chair shot of Addams Family.  Hit the standup to\n  advance one pop bumper's value from 1,000 to 2,500 to 5,000.\n\n- Comic Book Guy standup: This target is directly behind the Adv.\n  Pops standup.  It cannot be hit from either lower flipper\n  directly, but can be shot from the upper right flipper or on a\n  plunge.  Starts a Hurry Up when lit.  Also a Skill Shot.  See\n  \"Hurry Ups\" and \"Skill Shots\" sections for more.\n\n- Left (Treehouse) Ramp: Directly above the Comic Book Guy\n  standup.  This ramp feeds the upper playfield.  Collects\n  Treehouse of Horror when lit, and adds 1 Simpsons letter toward\n  D'Oh Frenzy, or 2 if hit as a combo from the Left (Cletus)\n  Orbit.  See \"D'Oh Frenzy\" and \"Treehouse of Horror\" sections for\n  more.\n\n- Left (Kwik-E-Mart) Loop: Inner loop above Left Ramp.  Shots\n  through Left Loop tend to hit Bully standups.  Kwik-E-Mart\n  collects Kwik-E-Mart value and adds a bonus multiplier.  Also a\n  Skill Shot.  See \"Skill Shots\" section for more.\n\n- Kwik-E-Mart standup: Guards Left Loop.  Adds a random value\n  between 1,000 and 9,990 to the Kwik-E-Mart award.  Shots off\n  this standup from the lower flippers tend to hit Bully standups.\n\n- Garage: Big door in general vicinity of the Toilet shots of\n  South Park.  Hit the door and it opens.  Go through the door and\n  over a small ramp to enter the upper playfield.  Shots that are\n  not powerful enough to make it over the ramp fall to the bumpers\n  via the Left Orbit (and count as Left Orbit shots).  Collects\n  \"Clean the Garage\" random award when lit.  Often adds 1 Simpsons\n  letter toward D'Oh Frenzy.  See \"D'Oh Frenzy\" and \"Clean the\n  Garage\" sections for more.\n\n- Right (Springfield Elementary) Loop: Inner loop behind Right\n  Ramp.  Shot is straight up the middle and can be made from\n  either lower flipper.  Feeds upper right flipper.  Starts Otto's\n  Bus Tour 2x Scoring and advances to Chalkboard Award.  See\n  \"Double Scoring\" and \"Chalkboard\" sections for more.\n\n- Bully standups: Three standup targets along the side wall of the\n  Right Loop shot.  Difficult to shoot directly, they are made\n  through the Left Loop or off the Kwik-E-Mart target.  Completing\n  the bank lights a Daredevil Mode.  Also a Skill Shot.  See\n  \"Daredevil Modes\" and \"Skill Shots\" sections for more.\n\n- Right (Moe's) Ramp: Get Duffed.  Scores 25,000 for the first\n  shot, then 5,000 more each shot to a maximum of 75,000.  Also\n  advances to Treehouse of Horror and Extra Ball.  See \"Treehouse\n  of Horror\" and \"Extra Balls\" sections for more.\n\n- Captive Ball: To the right of the Right Ramp is a captive ball.\n  Hitting it a short distance spots a Bully standup, and also\n  starts a Daredevil Mode or advances the value of a running\n  Daredevil Mode.  See \"Daredevil Modes\" section for more.\n\n- Right (Krusty) Orbit: Past the upper right flipper, through a\n  spinner, to the bumpers.  The first spin scores 1,000 points,\n  and each successive spin is an additional 50 points.  A set\n  number of spins in one ball awards an increasing (but small)\n  Spinner Bonus.  Can be lit for triple value or higher via the\n  left inlane.  Lights TV Mode.  See \"TV Modes\" section for more.\n\n- Itchy & Scratchy Drop Targets: Below the upper right flipper are\n  three drop targets.  Completing them scores 75,000 points, then\n  25,000 more each completion to a maximum of 150,000.  Behind them is\n  the...\n\n- Itchy & Scratchy Sinkhole: Behind the drop targets.  Lights, then\n  starts, an Itchy & Scratchy multiball.  See \"Itchy & Scratchy\n  Multiball\" section for more.\n\n- Right inlane / outlane / plunger lane: All three connected.  It is\n  possible to nudge the ball into the plunger lane for a free Skill\n  Shot.  The inlane can be lit for Extra Ball, while the outlane can\n  be lit for Special.\n\n- Manual plunger: Can be used to try for three Skill Shots: the Comic\n  Book Guy, Kwik-E-Mart, and the Bully standups.  See \"Skill Shots\"\n  section for more.\n\n-- And now, the upper playfield...\n\n- \"Lite\"/\"Lock\" standups: Hit these to light lock.  Difficulty of\n  lighting locks is variable.  See \"Couch Multiball\" section for more.\n  These targets can be hit from either upper playfield flipper, though\n  are easier from the lower left flipper.\n\n- Side (Couch) Ramp: Exit upper playfield.  If lock is lit, lock a ball\n  in the Couch.  If not, feed to the left inlane.  Can be shot by the\n  upper playfield's right flipper, but also possible on a carom from\n  the left.  The third lock starts Couch Multiball.\n\n- Light Mystery standup: Light \"Clean the Garage\" at the Garage if not\n  already lit.\n\n- Upper (TV) Loop: Feeds from lower flipper to upper flipper on\n  playfield.  Starts TV Mode when lit.  See \"TV Modes\" section for\n  more.\n\n- Monorail: Drain from upper playfield to right inlane.  Normally not a\n  good thing, this is actually a required step in the \"Stop the\n  Monorail\" TV mode.  See \"TV Modes\" section for more.\n\n-- Whew, that's \"all\".\n\n\n--- The Timer ---\n\nThe timer is your friend.  Don't let the timer run out.\n\nAll timed modes in The Simpsons Pinball Party run on the same timer.\nStarting a timed mode resets the timer.  The timer is displayed on the\nTV board, and will change colors as it counts down:\n\n More than 15 seconds left: green.\n Between 6 and 15 seconds left: yellow.\n 5 seconds or less remaining: red.\n\nWhat does this one timer to rule them all mean for you?  As long as\nyou start something else before the time runs out, you get to continue\nEVERYTHING you have started since the timer became active.\n\nThis is by far the most important thing to learn about playing this\ngame strategically.  There are at least 20 things that can reset the\ntimer, so it is theoretically possible to have -timed- modes such as\nthe D'Oh Frenzy running for more than 10 minutes.\n\nThe timer stops when the ball is in the bumpers, and time can be\nrestored by hitting the Pop Target.  Hitting the target after hitting\na bumper adds 2 seconds to the timer.  Hitting the target directly\nfrom a flipper (usually the upper right, but possible from either\nlower flipper) adds 5 seconds to the timer (\"Great googly moogly!\").\nHitting the target from the upper right flipper as a combo shot from\nthe Left (Cletus) Orbit adds 10 seconds to the timer (\"Ahoy! You are\nthe king!\").  The timer can go above 30 seconds; its maximum is 60\nseconds.  Getting the timer to 60 seconds awards a special bonus of\n2.5 million points the first time you do it in a game.\n\nThe timer is reset to 30 seconds if it is not already above 30 seconds\nwhen starting any of these:\n\n - Any of the 10 Otto 2x Scoring modes\n - Any of the 7 main TV Modes\n - D'Oh Frenzy\n - Any of the 5 Treehouse of Horror timed modes:\n  - Apu's Giveaway\n  - Captain's Bounty\n  - Krusty's Nightmare\n  - Nuclear Disaster\n  - Crazy Extra Ball\n - See \"Spoilers\" for some other timed modes.\n\nThe timer is -not- cleared when a TV Mode is completed by making all\nits shots; instead, Victory points are awarded for each shot (see\n\"Victory Points\" section for more).  The timer continues to run no\nmatter what else is going on, including multiballs.\n\nThere is a grace period of about 4 seconds on the timer (it will read\n00).  Hurry up and shoot something!\n\nNote that at most points in the game you are no more than 2 shots away\nfrom resetting the timer (Lite Otto, then shoot it).  Don't forget\nabout it!\n\n\n--- Double Scoring ---\n\nShooting the Right Loop when Otto's Bus Tour is lit starts a double\nscoring mode.  The double scoring modes are indicated by red lights at\nmajor shots.  A flashing light indicates that the double scoring for\nthat shot is currently running, while a solid light indicates that the\ndouble scoring for that shot has already completed and will not be\navailable again until all double scoring modes are completed.\n\nThe ten double scoring areas are:\n\n - Bumpers\n - Left (Cletus) Orbit\n - Left (Treehouse) Ramp\n - Left (Kwik-E-Mart) Loop\n - Garage\n - Right (Springfield Elementary) Loop\n - Right (Moe's) Ramp\n - Right (Krusty) Orbit\n - Itchy & Scratchy\n - Living Room (entire upper playfield)\n\nThese ten areas are awarded in a seemingly random order.  They are\nawarded in a fixed order during tournament play.\n\nDouble scoring applies to ALL shots to that area, including shots\nduring TV Modes and multiballs.\n\nDouble scoring continues until the timer runs out or the ball ends.\nSince the timer can be reset, double scoring may run for a very long\ntime.\n\nWhen all ten double scoring modes have been completed (and are not\nrunning), the red lights will pulse instead of being solidly lit.\nThen, shoot the Otto shot one more time to start... see \"Spoilers\"\nsection for more.\n\n\n--- TV Modes ---\n\nTV Modes are lit after every 4 goals.  No, that's not it.  TV Modes\nare lit by shooting the Right (Krusty) Orbit.  They are started by\nmaking the TV Loop on the upper playfield, or by an award from \"Clean\nthe Garage\".  Starting a TV Mode scores an instant 250,000 points and\nis counted toward the final score for the mode.  Most completed TV\nModes score 2,500,000 points, and possibly as much as 4,750,000 if\ndouble scoring is active.\n\nThere are seven base TV Modes.  Each resets the 30-second timer.  You\ncan control which TV Mode will be next by flipping the right flipper.\nTV Modes remain active until the timer expires, or until all shots in\nthe mode are completed.  If all shots for all active TV modes are\ncompleted, Victory points can be earned.  See \"Victory Points\" section\nfor more.  Remember that any shot where \"2x Scoring\" is flashing will\ndouble in value at any time, including TV Modes.\n\nHere is a description of each of the seven TV Modes.\n\n -- TV Mode: Duffman --\n\n \"Duffman likes your attitude!\"  Shoot the right ramp to SCORE.  Five\n shots to complete.  Score from 250,000 to 650,000 by increments of\n 100,000.  \"OH yeah!\"\n\n -- TV Mode: Homer's Day --\n\n \"Wake me up when it's break time...\"  Shoot the Nuclear plant bumpers,\n then shoot Moe's, then the Garage, and finally the Couch Ramp.  Nice,\n huh?\n\n The first three shots score 500,000, while the Couch scores 750,000.\n \"Beer. The cause of, and solution to, all life's problems.\"  Check out\n the animation of Homer eating his dream donut at the end.\n\n -- TV Mode: Willie's Woes --\n\n Hit the Bully standups for 250,000, then Springfield Elementary for\n 500,000.  Repeat three times to complete.  Stomp those flowers,\n Kearney.\n\n To hit the Bully standups, try the Kwik-E-Mart shots.  Or, lock a ball\n and plunge the loop!\n\n -- TV Mode: Wiggum vs. Snake --\n\n \"Another dirtbag...\"  This \"chase\" goes across the board.  The first\n shot can be any of the Right Loop, Right Ramp, or Right Orbit.  The\n second shot can be either the Left Loop or Left Ramp.  The third shot\n must be the Left Orbit.  The first shot scores 500,000, the second\n scores 750,000, and the third scores 1 million.  Try for shots that\n have double scoring active to make the round more lucrative.\n\n -- TV Mode: Bart's Day --\n\n \"Bite me, Skinner...\"  Shoot Springfield Elementary, then any\n Kwik-E-Mart shot (loop or target), then Treehouse, then the TV.  The\n first three shots score 500,000, while the TV scores 750,000.  Is this\n the first ever dot display animation of a full moon?\n\n -- TV Mode: Krusty's Last Stand --\n\n Score 100 rating points to complete this mode.  Shoot the Right Orbit\n to earn 20 rating points for each shot, plus 1 rating point for each\n spinner spin.  Each rating point is worth 20,000 points, so completing\n the mode is worth 2,000,000 plus any extra ratings points on the last\n shot.\n\n Note: In earlier ROMs (2.04), each Right Orbit shot earned 10 rating\n points, not 20, making this mode last longer than it does now.\n\n -- TV Mode: Stop the Monorail --\n\n In this mode, the ball must travel down the Monorail, the \"drain\" from\n the upper playfield.  This scores 250,000 and lights all major lower\n playfield shots for 500,000.  Shoot any shot to relight the Monorail\n \"shot\".  Repeat this three times with three different lower playfield\n shots to complete the mode.  Try for shots that have double scoring\n active.  Watch the dot matrix when a main playfield shot is made to\n see what is being used to stop the monorail...\n\nWhen all seven TV Modes have ended, either by the timer running out or\nby completing them, the TV will be lit for... see \"Spoilers\" section\nfor more.\n\nThe first time through the TV Modes, a mode will automatically be lit\nat the start of each ball.  After the first time through, the TV Mode\nwill not be lit at the start of a ball, and you must shoot the Right\nOrbit to light the first mode of a ball.\n\n\n--- Victory Points ---\n\nVictory points, sometimes referred to as \"Siegpunkte\", are scored when\na major shot is hit while\n\n - the timer is on, and\n - all active TV Modes have been completed during the current timer run\n\nThe number of points scored depends on the number of completed TV\nModes during the current timer run:\n\n - 1 completed TV Mode :   100,000 per shot\n - 2 completed TV Modes:   250,000 per shot\n - 3 completed TV Modes:   500,000 per shot\n - 4 completed TV Modes:   800,000 per shot\n - 5 completed TV Modes: 1,250,000 per shot\n - 6 completed TV Modes: 1,750,000 per shot\n - 7 completed TV Modes: 2,500,000 per shot\n\nThese points will award for every major shot (loops, ramps, orbits,\nholes), along with a tinkly sound effect and an animation of Homer at\nthe top of the mountain.\n\nVictory points can be huge, potentially more valuable than a\nwell-played multiball, but they take a lot of work to achieve.  All TV\nModes in progress must be completed before any of these points are\navailable.\n\nIf you start a new TV Mode during Victory, you won't get any more\nVictory points until you finish the TV Mode.  However, they will be\nworth more if you complete the mode.\n\nDouble scoring applies to these points as long as an active shot is\nhit, so it is possible to make all major shots worth 5 million points\nfor 30 seconds or more by skillfully playing TV Modes and starting\nOtto 2x Scoring.  I suppose this depends on your meaning of\n\"possible\", though.\n\n\n--- Hurry Ups ---\n\nA Hurry Up is started by shooting the Comic Book Guy (\"CBG\") at any\ntime, even during multiballs.  When a Hurry Up begins, it will light\nat one of six major shots:\n\n - Left (Cletus) Orbit\n - Left (Treehouse) Ramp\n - Left (Kwik-E-Mart) Loop\n - Garage\n - Right (Moe's) Ramp\n - Right (Krusty) Orbit\n\nThe Hurry Up value starts at 200,000 and counts down to 50,000.\n\nHitting the Comic Book Guy again starts a second Hurry Up\nsimultaneously.  When multiple Hurry Ups are active, their value is\nincreased and multiplied.  Specifically, 50,000 is added to the base\nvalue and the base value is multiplied by the number of started Hurry\nUps.  So, if two Hurry Ups are started at once, their value is 250,000\nx 2 = 500,000.  [This might all be dead wrong.]  The base value counts\ndown at the same speed throughout, so the Hurry Ups will count down\nfaster when more of them are active.  When multiple Hurry Ups are\nactive, shooting one collects the value, and adds 50,000 to the base\nvalue of the remaining active Hurry Ups (still multiplied by the\nnumber of Hurry Ups).  [Again, might be dead wrong.]\n\nYou may want to try to get a whole bunch of Hurry Ups completed in a\nsingle run.  Completing a run of 3 or more Hurry Ups together gives a\nbonus award:\n\n - 3 Hurry Ups: Advance Itchy\n - 4 Hurry Ups: Award Couch Lock\n - 5 Hurry Ups: Light Extra Ball\n - 6 Hurry Ups: Light Special\n\nDouble scoring applies to these points (of course!), so you may score\ndouble the displayed value.\n\nHitting the Comic Book Guy from a plunger shot is a Skill Shot and\nstarts two Hurry Ups immediately at a starting value of 500,000\n(250,000 x 2).\n\nWhen a Hurry Up has been collected, its light will stay solidly on\nuntil all six Hurry Ups have been collected.  When all have been\ncollected, the lights will be pulsing rather than solidly lit.  Then,\nhit the Comic Book Guy one more time to start... see \"Spoilers\"\nsection for more.\n\nDon't drain while a Hurry Up is active, or the Comic Book Guy will\nlambaste you with his sarcastic \"wit\" - \"Oh, and you were doing SO\nwell.\"  Similar wit applies when a Hurry Up times out.  \"The Flash,\nyou are not.\"\n\nThe Status Report keeps track of how many Hurry Ups you have made, as\nwell as how many you have missed.  [No idea what the number of missed\nmeans in terms of gameplay awards.]\n\n\n--- Daredevil Modes ---\n\nA Daredevil Mode is lit by completing the Bully standup bank, and is\nstarted by hitting the Captive Ball.  It is possible to light as many\nas all four Daredevil Modes before starting one, and the Captive Ball\nstarts only one at a time, always from top to bottom.  Hitting the\nCaptive Ball also spots one Bully standup in the bank of three.\n\nThe lights in front of the Captive Ball indicate the status of each\nDaredevil Mode:\n\n - flashing: lit\n - pulsing: currently active\n - solid: completed\n\nEach Daredevil Mode accumulates points for a particular type of shot.\nThese points are added to end-of-ball bonus.  When a Daredevil Mode\nstarts, its value is 100,000.  When 750,000 points (or more) have been\nscored, a bonus of 250,000 points is added to complete the mode at\njust over 1 million.  All in all, this is a similar system to World\nCup Soccer's Ultra Modes, including the fact that no points are scored\nuntil the end of the ball.  Don't tilt your Daredevils!\n\nEach Daredevil Mode scores on certain shots:\n\n - Daredevil Ramps scores on any ramp, including the Garage mini-ramp\n   and the Couch ramp on the upper playfield.  Starting value is 50,000\n   per ramp.\n - Daredevil Loops scores on either Orbit, either Loop, and the TV Loop\n   on the upper playfield.  Starting value is 50,000 per loop.\n - Daredevil Bumpers scores on any bumper or slingshot hit.  Not since\n   Mario Andretti have slingshots been worth this many points!\n   Starting value is 12,500 per bumper.\n - Daredevil Targets scores on, well, targets.  Standups and drops\n   apply.  Starting value is 25,000 per target.\n\nDouble scoring applies to these points (of course!), which can help\ncomplete the mode that much sooner.  The goal is still 750,000 points.\n\nHitting the Captive Ball during a Daredevil Mode increases the value\nof each shot by 50% of the original value, allowing the Daredevil Mode\nto be completed more quickly.  For example, one hit during Daredevil\nRamps will make each ramp worth 75,000 -- another hit will make each\nramp worth 100,000.\n\nHitting the strobing Bully standup from a plunger shot (via the\nKwik-E-Mart) is a Skill Shot, scoring an increasing number of points\nfrom 250,000 to 500,000 and immediately lighting a Daredevil Mode at\nthe Captive Ball.\n\nWhen all four Daredevil Modes have been completed by earning at least\n1 million points on each, all four lights in front of the Captive Ball\nwill pulse.  Then, hit the Captive Ball one more time to start... see\n\"Spoilers\" section for more.\n\nDon't tilt your Daredevils!\n\n\n--- Itchy & Scratchy Multiball ---\n\nThe Itchy & Scratchy 3-bank of targets hides a sinkhole.  To start\nItchy & Scratchy Multiball, you must:\n\n 1. Knock down the entire bank of targets.\n 2. Shoot the hole.\n 3. Knock down the entire bank of targets again.\n 4. Shoot the hole to start the multiball.\n\nThe rules are relaxed a bit for the first multiball.  For the first\nmultiball, you may shoot the hole without completing the bank of\ntargets.  For later multiballs, if you shoot the hole without\ncompleting the bank of targets, you do not get progress toward the\nmultiball, and the targets all reset.\n\nThe rules are tighter for the third and later multiballs.  The bank of\ntargets will reset on its own after a time.  The timer seems to\nshorten for the fourth multiball, but tends to stay about the same\nafter that. [?]\n\nCompleting the target bank is worth 75,000 points the first time, then\nincreases by 25,000, to a maximum of 150,000.  Sweeping the target\nbank will award double the current value, and is hard to pull off on\npurpose.\n\nThe lit Itchy & Scratchy Multiball can be changed by hitting the right\nflipper.  All multiballs are similar.  Starting the multiball will\nturn on a brief ball saver and fire a ball onto the playfield.  Since\nItchy & Scratchy Multiball can be started while other multiballs are\nactive, there may be more than two balls in play.\n\nJackpot starts at 100,000, and all major shots collect it.  You must\nshoot a different shot for the next Jackpot, but only one shot will\never be unlit at a time.  Collecting a Jackpot adds its value to the\nSuper Jackpot, which starts at 500,000, maxes out at 2.5 million, and\nis collected by making the Itchy & Scratchy hole.\n\nThe first Super Jackpot is collected by just shooting the Itchy &\nScratchy hole.  Later Super Jackpots in the same multiball require all\nthree drop targets to be knocked down first.\n\nIn each multiball, the Jackpot is raised by something different:\n\n - Spay Anything: Spinner spins add 2,000 to Jackpot\n - Kitty Kitty Bang Bang: Bumpers add 1,000 to Jackpot\n - Field of Screams: Captive Ball adds 25,000 to Jackpot\n - Esophagus Now: All shots add 10,000 to Jackpot\n\nEsophagus Now tends to be the highest-scoring of these four\nmultiballs, due to the way Jackpot values increase.  Since you can\ncontrol which one you get by the right flipper, this is something to\nconsider.\n\nDouble scoring applies to these points (of course!), producing Double\nJackpots and Double Super Jackpots.  Listen for the special sound\neffect for the Double Super Jackpot!\n\nWhen all four Itchy & Scratchy Multiballs have been played, put the\nball in the Itchy & Scratchy hole one more time to start... see\n\"Spoilers\" section for more.\n\n\n--- Couch Multiball ---\n\nCouch Multiball begins when three balls have been locked in the Couch.\n Locks are lit by hitting the \"Lite\"/\"Lock\" standup targets, then\ncollected by shooting the upper playfield's ramp when the Lock light\nis on.  If the Lock light is flashing, the next Lock shot starts Couch\nMultiball.\n\nLocks become progressively more difficult for each multiball:\n\n- For the first multiball, all locks are lit automatically.\n- For the second multiball, the \"Lite\" and \"Lock\" targets must each be\n  hit once to light a lock, and all three locks may be lit at once.\n- For the third multiball, the \"Lite\" and \"Lock\" targets must each be\n  hit once to light a lock, and each lock must be collected before the\n  next can be lit.\n- For the fourth multiball, the \"Lite\" and \"Lock\" targets must each be\n  hit once, in order, and each lock must be collected before the next\n  can be lit.\n- For the fifth multiball, the \"Lite\" and \"Lock\" targets must each be\n  hit twice to light a lock (in any order), and each lock must be\n  collected before the next can be lit.\n- For the sixth and later multiballs, the \"Lite\" target must be hit\n  twice, then the \"Lock\" target must be hit twice, then each lock must\n  be collected before the next can be lit.\n\nThe first lock scores 100,000 points, the second lock scores 250,000,\nand the third lock scores 500,000 points (and starts multiball, of\ncourse).\n\nBased on settings, you may be able to \"steal\" other players' locked\nballs or start Couch Multiball more easily if one or two balls are in\nthe Couch at the beginning of the game.  This can be a good reason to\nkeep playing, since you can put 3 balls in the Couch over the course\nof several games and get the multiball.\n\nCouch Multiball is a three-ball multiball when nothing else is going\non, and triggers a short ball saver.  Eight major shots score an\nincreasing Jackpot.\n\nThe Jackpot value starts at 200,000 and goes up by 25,000 for every\nscored Jackpot.  When a Super Jackpot is scored, the Jackpot value\nresets, UNLESS you score all eight Jackpots before the Super.  If you\ndo, the Jackpot value will be held and becomes the new base value for\nall future Couch Multiballs.  The Jackpot value caps at 1 million.\n\nUpper flipper shots (Left Ramp, Left Loop) score Double Jackpots.  The\nTV Loop scores a Triple Jackpot.  Lower flipper shots (Left / Right\nOrbit, Garage, Right Ramp, Right Loop) score a Jackpot.  The Couch\nRamp scores the Super Jackpot, worth 5 times the Jackpot, and relights\nall eight Jackpots.\n\nThe Super Jackpot will not always be lit immediately.  The Nth Super\nJackpot takes (N-1) Jackpots to light it.  So, the first Super Jackpot\nis lit immediately -- and the fifth Super Jackpot won't light until\nyou make at least 4 Jackpots.  [After this, it seems to take 5 shots\nto light Super each time.  Not sure.]\n\nDouble scoring applies to these points (of course!), producing Double\nJackpots, Quadruple Jackpots, Sextuple Jackpots, and Double Super\nJackpots.  Listen for the special sound effect on the Double Super\nJackpot!\n\nWhen the Super Jackpot is lit, a family member's playfield light (look\nin the center) will flash, and when it is collected, the light becomes\nsolidly lit for the rest of the game.  When all five family members\nhave been collected (i.e., 5 Super Jackpots have been collected),\nprogress is earned toward... see \"Spoilers\" section for more.\n\nCouch Multiball ends when one ball is left on the playfield, but there\nis a long grace period where one or more additional Jackpot shots may\nbe made -- it is even possible to start Itchy & Scratchy Multiball\nduring the grace period, in which case both multiballs continue.  Woo\nhoo!\n\n\n--- D'Oh Frenzy ---\n\nOne letter in \"Simpsons\" is awarded for opening the Garage, shooting\nthe Garage mini-ramp (to feed the upper playfield), or shooting the\nLeft (Treehouse) Ramp.  Two letters can be earned by shooting the Left\nRamp after the Left (Cletus) Orbit.  Listen for Homer's quality\nspelling job.  \"Simpso?!\"  \"Ohhh, Simpsons!\"\n\nWhen \"Simpsons\" is complete, D'Oh Frenzy begins.  The timer is reset\nto 30 seconds if not already above 30, and all switches score.  The\nfirst D'Oh Frenzy is worth 10,000 per switch, and further Frenzies\nscore 2,500 more per switch.\n\nFor the second Frenzy, you'll only get letters by shooting through the\nGarage or Left Ramp.  For the third and later Frenzies, you'll only\nget letters by shooting the Left Ramp. [?]\n\nD'Oh Frenzy can run for a very long time, since the timer is reset by\nmany different events.  See \"The Timer\" section for more.  D'Oh Frenzy\nends only when the timer expires, the ball in play ends, or a mode\nthat ends all timed rounds starts (see \"Spoilers\" section for more).\n\n\n--- Treehouse of Horror ---\n\nTreehouse of Horror is lit by making enough Right (Moe's) Ramp shots,\nthen collected by shooting the Left (Treehouse) Ramp.  There are many\npossible choices, some which give a quick point award, and others that\nstart a timed round.  You won't know what you're about to get until\nit's awarded, but the awards cycle: you will get all the Treehouse\nawards before seeing one for a second time.\n\nOn default settings, Treehouse is lit at 5 ramp shots, then 15, 25,\nand every 10 thereafter.  Treehouse awards are stackable, so you do\nnot need to collect the award before lighting the next one.\n\nHere is a description of each of the Treehouse of Horror awards:\n\n -- Treehouse: Apu's Giveaway --\n\n In this timed mode, the Kwik-E-Mart shot is worth more points than\n normal, and awards 2 or 3 bonus multipliers instead of just 1 per\n shot.  The display will tell you how many multipliers will be awarded\n for the next Kwik-E-Mart shot.  \"Sanjay, give this man more points!\"\n\n -- Treehouse: Captain's Bounty --\n\n In this timed mode, each of the Left (Treehouse) Ramp, Garage, and\n Right (Moe's) Ramp score points.  How many points?  Read the treasure\n chests!  Each chest starts at \"1\" -- the Left Ramp adds to the\n leftmost chest, the Garage to the center chest, and the Right Ramp to\n the right chest.  You then score the number of thousands on the chest\n (so the first award is either 211,000, 121,000, or 112,000, depending\n on the shot hit).  The Left Ramp adds the most to the value, but all\n three collect it.  Each shot will max out at \"9\", so it is possible\n (hah!) to get each shot worth 999,000.\n\n -- Treehouse: Krusty's Nightmare --\n\n In this timed mode, each spin of the Krusty spinner scores a random\n number of points.  Each spin changes the number of digits, from 2 up\n to 6, then right back to 2.  You can score as little as 10 points and\n as many as 999,990 points for an individual spin.  \"Are you nuts?\"\n\n -- Treehouse: Nuclear Disaster --\n\n \"Mr. Smithers, it's happening again...\"  In this timed mode, each\n bumper hit scores 20,000.  Earn 1 million points by making 50 bumper\n hits before the timer runs out.  Further bumpers award 100,000 per\n hit, so this mode can be worth more than any of the TV Modes.\n\n -- Treehouse: Max Everything --\n\n Max all incrementing awards, such as the Bumper value, both Ramp\n values, Chalkboard value, and 3-bank completion values.  Great award.\n\n -- Treehouse: Really Big Points --\n\n Awards 2 million points.  Used to be called \"Horrifyingly Big Points\".\n\n -- Treehouse: 10x Nuclear Value --\n\n Score 10x the current Nuclear Value.  Also advances 1 (not 10) Nuclear\n Value collections toward Extra Ball.  See \"Nuclear Value\" section for\n more.\n\n -- Treehouse: Crazy Extra Ball --\n\n Oh boy.  Extra Ball is lit at one of the three lanes (left outlane\n plus either inlane), but you do not get to control the lit lane.  The\n GAME controls the lane, and you won't like its choices.  Ball heading\n out of the bumpers?  Oh, the right inlane will become lit.  Ball\n heading down the Monorail?  Oh, look, it switched to the left inlane\n just in time.  Hilarious, unless you expect to get the extra ball!\n \"Whoa, that's freaky.\"  This is a timed mode, and you'll get 2 million\n for any \"extra ball\" rollovers after the first.  This can be worth a\n lot of points!\n\n -- Treehouse: Really Small Points --\n\n Awards as many points as Really Big Points, but in a super-small font!\n Note: this award was only available on older ROM versions of Simpsons.\n\n\n--- Cletus Kids ---\n\nEach time you shoot the Left Orbit (directly, or as fallback from a\nfailed Garage mini-ramp shot), you get a Cletus Kid.  The display will\nshow the name of the new kid and the point award.  Awards start at\n25,000 and increase by 5,000 per shot.\n\nGreat displays here, since all the previously awarded kids are still\nshown in the animation.\n\nThe kids are Tiffany, Heather, Cody, Dylan, Dermot, Jordan, Taylor,\nBrittany, Wesley, Rumer, Scout, Cassidy, Zoe, Chloe, Max, Hunter,\nKendall, Caitlin, Noah, Sasha, Morgan, Kyra, Ian, Lauren, Q-bert, and\nPhil.\n\nSince there are 26 kids, shoot Cletus 26 times to collect all the\nkids.  Then, shoot Cletus one more time to start... see \"Spoilers\"\nsection for more.\n\n\n--- Random Awards ---\n\nThere are two shots that give random awards: the Garage and\nSpringfield Elementary.  The Garage gives \"Clean the Garage\" awards\nwhen lit, and Springfield Elementary gives \"Chalkboard Completed\"\nawards every few shots.\n\n -- \"Clean the Garage\" --\n\n Clean the Garage is lit to start, and is relit by shooting the standup\n target on the upper playfield.  Shoot the Garage mini-ramp to collect\n the award.\n\n The possible awards include [likely incomplete list]:\n\n  - Light Special\n  - Light Extra Ball\n  - Light Lock\n  - Award Lock\n  - Light Otto\n  - Award Otto\n  - Light TV Mode\n  - Start TV Mode\n  - Start Hurry Up\n  - Light Itchy (clear drop targets)\n  - Advance Itchy (award hole shot)\n  - Light Nuclear Value\n  - Light Daredevil\n  - Start Daredevil\n  - Small Points (10,000-90,000)\n  - Big Points (100,000-900,000)\n  - Max Bumpers\n  - Max Nuclear Value\n  - Max Right Ramp\n  - Max Left Ramp\n  - Max Drop Targets\n  - Max Chalkboard\n  - Max Kwik-E-Mart\n  - Max Headroom\n  - Add to Bonus (50,000)\n  - Add [ ]x Bonus (from 1x to 5x)\n  - [ ] Simpsons Letters (from 1 to 3?)\n  - Add [ ] Cletus Kids (from 1 to 3?)\n  - Add [ ] Duffs (from 1 to 5)\n  - Add [ ] Time (from 5 to 15 seconds)\n\n -- Chalkboard Awards --\n\n Chalkboard Awards are given for shooting Springfield Elementary\n several times.  Each shot gives a small number of points, but some\n shots also give a random award.  It seems to take an increasing number\n of shots each time, starting from 3 shots.\n\n The possible awards include [likely incomplete list]:\n\n  - Hold Bonus Multiplier\n  - Hold End-of-Ball Bonus (value, not multiplier)\n  - Hold Nuclear Value\n  - Hold Chalkboard Value\n  - Hold Left Ramp Value\n  - Hold Right Ramp Value\n  - Hold Kwik-E-Mart Value\n\n It appears to be possible to go through all the awards, and then they\n repeat.  In this case, you'll get to carry the award over for another\n ball.\n\n\n--- Skill Shots ---\n\nThere are three available Skill Shots in the game.  The first is the\nComic Book Guy target, which normally starts a Hurry Up.  Hitting it\nfrom a plunge scores an increasing number of points, from 500,000 to\n1,000,000 and starts two Hurry Ups immediately.\n\nThe second Skill Shot is the Kwik-E-Mart loop, which normally adds a\nbonus multiplier.  Hitting it from a plunge adds an increasing number\nof bonus multipliers: 5x, 6x, ..., up to 10x.\n\nThe third Skill Shot is the strobing Bully standup.  Hitting the Bully\nstandup (almost always via the Kwik-E-Mart) scores an increasing\nnumber of points, 250,000 to 500,000, and lights the next Daredevil\nMode immediately.\n\nTry maxing out one or more of the Skill Shots by hitting it six times!\n You'll like it.\n\n--- Miscellaneous Scoring ---\n\n -- End-of-Ball Bonus --\n\n A switch bonus is kept throughout the ball; it starts at 10,000 and\n 130 points is added for every switch you hit.  When you drain, this\n switch bonus is multiplied by the bonus multiplier, and any Daredevil\n Mode points are added to give a final value.\n\n There is a maximum of 99x bonus multiplier.  Shots to the Kwik-E-Mart\n loop after 99x has been reached score 1 million each.\n\n Both the switch bonus and the bonus multiplier can be held to the next\n ball as a result of Chalkboard Awards.\n\n -- Combos --\n\n Combos exist in the game, from 3-Way to 5-Way.  A 3-Way Combo is worth\n 250,000 points.  A 4-Way Combo is worth 500,000 points, for a total of\n 750,000.   A 5-Way Combo is worth 750,000 points, for a total of 1.5\n million.\n\n Some examples of Combos are Cletus > Treehouse > TV > Couch (4-Way),\n and Moe's > Elementary > Treehouse > TV > Couch (5-Way).\n\n -- Kwik-E-Mart --\n\n The Left (Kwik-E-Mart) Loop scores points and adds a bonus multiplier.\n The number of points awarded by the Kwik-E-Mart Loop is increased by a\n random score between 1,000 and 9,990 by hitting the target in front of\n the loop.  The maximum award for the loop is 200,000.\n\n Shooting Kwik-E-Mart as a combo from the Left Orbit will award more\n than one bonus multiplier.\n\n -- Moe's --\n\n The Right (Moe's) Ramp scores 25,000 for the first shot, then 5,000\n for each additional shot, to a maximum of 75,000.  On the default\n settings,  Extra Ball is lit at 10 ramps, then every 50 ramps after\n that.\n\n -- Nuclear Value --\n\n The Nuclear Value starts at 100,000, and can be increased as high as\n 500,000.  Add to the Nuclear Value by hitting any pop bumper.  The\n Nuclear Value is lit by shooting the Left (Cletus) Loop, and collected\n by hitting the Pop Target directly above the bumpers.   Collecting the\n Nuclear Value advances toward lighting an Extra Ball.  On default\n settings, an Extra Ball is lit when the Nuclear Value has been\n collected 10 times, and every 50 times after that.  The score and\n collection count depend on how the target was hit:\n\n - If hit as a bounce from a bumper, score the base value and count 1\n   collection.\n - If hit directly (no bumpers involved), score triple the base value\n   and count 3 collections.  This is usually done from the upper right\n   flipper, but can be done from the lower flippers by luck.\n - If hit from the upper right flipper immediately after a Left Orbit,\n   score five times the base value and count 5 collections.\n\n The Nuclear Value can also be scored at a 10x multiplier from a\n Treehouse of Terror award, but this only counts as 1 collection.\n\n\n -- Spinner Points --\n\n Spinning the spinner adds an increasing number of points per spin,\n beginning at 1,000 and raising by 50 per spin.  Going through the left\n inlane triggers a brief period where the spinner is worth triple, then\n quadruple.  \"Nail that clown!\"  \"Hee hee, hit him again!\"\n\n Additionally, a bonus is awarded after a number of spins [60? 80?].\n This bonus is not a lot of points [200,000, then 300,000?], but a nice\n little addition.\n\nDouble scoring applies to all these miscellaneous points (of course!),\nso get them while the getting is good.\n\n\n--- Extra Balls ---\n\nExtra Balls can be lit in many ways.  Here is a list of some of the\nways to light an Extra Ball:\n\n - Hit the Right (Moe's) Ramp 10 times, 60 times, 110 times...\n - Collect the Nuclear Value 10 times, 60 times, 110 times...\n - Complete 5 Hurry Ups in one run.\n - Score the first Super Jackpot during Couch Multiball.  (Only once.)\n - Collect all eight Jackpots plus Super during Couch Multiball.\n   (Once.)\n - Collect all the 1x Jackpots, then the 2x Jackpots, then the 3x\n   Jackpot, then the Super during Couch Multiball.  (Once.)\n - Get \"Crazy Extra Ball\" from Treehouse of Horror and hope for the\n   best.\n - Light Extra Ball from a \"Clean the Garage\" award.\n - Score few enough points to light the \"bozo\" Extra Ball on your\n   final ball.  Or, should that be the Krusty Extra Ball?\n\nExtra Balls are lit on the inlanes and left outlane.  All except the\nCrazy Extra Ball may be controlled by flipping either flipper.\n\n\n--- Spoiler Section ---\n\nWARNING:  This section includes spoilers for many of the special\nfeatures available in the game.  Don't read this section unless you\nabsolutely want to ruin the surprise of seeing these special features\nyourself.\n\n--- SPOILERS FOLLOW ---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- SPOILERS ---\n\nOkay, that ought to be enough space to keep everyone away.  Oh, you're\nstill reading?  Fine, be spoiled, see if I care.\n\n\n -- Double Scoring --\n\nWhen all ten double scoring modes have been completed (and are not\nrunning), the red lights will pulse instead of being solidly lit.\nListen for the quote, you'll love it --\n\n\"You have come to the end of your journey, it's sad and alarming...\"\n\nThen, shoot the Otto shot one more time to start...\n\n--- SPRINGFIELD MYSTERY SPOT ---\n\n\"Where logic takes a holiday and all laws of nature are meaningless.\"\nBoy, you'd better believe it, because the left flipper button and the\nright flipper button have switched their abilities.  \"Aww,\neverything's all backwards!\"  Try playing cross-handed, or hitting\nboth buttons at once.\n\nFortunately, all major shots are lit for 500,000 apiece, double\nscoring is active for ALL ten shots, and five balls are put onto the\nplayfield with a lengthy ball saver.  Mystery Spot, by itself, isn't\nworth so many points; but WITH something else, it can make your score\njump in a hurry.\n\nSpringfield Mystery Spot ends when only one ball is left on the\nplayfield, and things return to normal (you'll still be freaked out\nfor many seconds).  Fortunately, a ball saver kicks in at the end of\nthis event to keep you from losing your ball due to switching back.\n\nTo \"win\" Springfield Mystery Spot you must\n\n - first, complete all ten major shots that score Jackpots.\n - second, shoot the Garage for a Super Jackpot and 5 million points.\n\nThe red lights that indicate 2x scoring will tell you which of the ten\nmajor shots you still need to collect.  The most easily forgotten\nlights are the TV, the Left Ramp, the Right Orbit, and the Itchy &\nScratchy hole.\n\nWhy is the second phase so difficult?  Because the Garage closes, and\nwill only open for about 3 seconds when you hit it.  So, to get the\nSuper you must open the Garage then nail a second ball through it to\nscore.  If you do so, the first phase starts again.  Note that if you\ndrop out of Springfield Mystery Spot during the second phase, the\nGarage will be open for a nice, plum, Super Jackpot shot for several\nseconds.\n\n\"Winning\" Springfield Mystery Spot is pretty important if you plan\non... see \"Big Spoiler\" section for more.\n\n\n -- TV Modes --\n\nWhen all seven TV Modes have ended, either by the timer running out or\nby completing them, the TV will be lit for...\n\n--- ALIEN INVASION ---\n\nIt's an Attack from Mars!  No, wait...  It's just Kang and Kodos, or\none of them at least.  The timer is set according to the number of TV\nModes you completed during the run:\n\n  1 mode  =  45 seconds\n  2 modes =  50 seconds\n  3 modes =  55 seconds\n  4 modes =  60 seconds\n  5 modes =  65 seconds\n  6 modes =  70 seconds\n  7 modes =  99 seconds\n\nIn earlier ROM revisions, Alien Invasion always started at 60 seconds.\n\nThere are four phases to Alien Invasion.  In each phase the goal is to\nlock all balls.  One ball may be locked in the Itchy & Scratchy hole\nand in Springfield Elementary at any time.  Up to three balls may be\nlocked in the Couch at any time.\n\nAdditionally, if there is only one ball remaining, that ball may be\nlocked in Springfield Elementary, the Garage, the Treehouse, the TV\nLoop, or the Couch.\n\nIn each phase, an increasing number of balls are kicked out.  In phase\none, 2 balls must be locked.  In phase four, 5 balls must be locked.\nIf you lose a ball after the ball saver has shut off, you drop down to\nthe next lower phase and must complete it again.\n\nFinishing phase four requires at least two balls to be locked in the\nCouch without losing a single ball.  Supremely challenging.  It can be\nhelpful to lock the last ball of earlier phases in the Garage, giving\nenough time to hit the Couch during the next phase's ball saver.\n\nEach lock scores 500,000 points the first time through a level (and\n50,000 thereafter).  Finishing a phase for the first time scores 1\nmillion multiplied by the number of balls in play for that phase, and\nadds 10 seconds to the timer.  \"Run!!  He's got a board with a nail in\nit!!\"\n\nFinish phase four and you \"win\" Alien Invasion.  This is pretty\nimportant if you plan on... see \"Big Spoiler\" section for more.  If\nyou are not deliberately trying to \"win\" all these modes, it is\nprobably better to keep Invasion going, since other points are\navailable (most readily available is Daredevil).\n\nIf the timer runs out, all balls drain and the mode is over.\n\nInvasion ends the regular gameplay timer, but will award compensation\nfor anything in progress.  In particular, it will automatically score\nany in-progress Hurry Ups, and scores 10 Victory awards if that is\nrunning.  [There is a lot more detail here on what happens for other\nmodes, not likely to be tracked down.]\n\n\n -- Hurry Ups --\n\nWhen a Hurry Up has been collected, its light will stay solidly on\nuntil all six Hurry Ups have been collected.  When all have been\ncollected, the lights will be pulsing rather than solidly lit.  Then,\nhit the Comic Book Guy one more time to start...\n\n--- SECRET STASH ---\n\nWhen Secret Stash begins, all six Hurry Up lights flash, and a\ncountdown begins at 500,000.  The countdown goes to 100,000.  Shooting\na Hurry Up clears it and resets the countdown to 500,000.\n\nYou must hit ten Hurry Ups to complete Secret Stash.\n\nAll six Hurry Ups will relight if you complete them all, or if you hit\nthe Comic Book Guy during the round.  Completing the six Hurry Ups\nwithout hitting the Comic Book Guy scores a 2 million \"All Shots\nCompleted\" bonus.\n\nCompleting Secret Stash awards a 1 million point bonus.\n\nDouble scoring applies to all Hurry Ups (of course!), so each can be\nworth up to 1 million, and the round can be worth up to a total of 13\nmillion points.\n\nFinishing Secret Stash is pretty important if you plan on... see \"Big\nSpoiler\" section for more.\n\n\n -- Daredevil Modes --\n\nWhen all four Daredevil Modes have been completed by earning at least\n1 million points on each, all four lights in front of the Captive Ball\nwill pulse.  Then, hit the Captive Ball one more time to start...\n\n--- DAREDEVIL MANIA ---\n\nDaredevil Mania is an untimed round where you must earn 5 million\npoints from Daredevil shots.  All four types of shots (ramps, loops,\nbumpers, and targets) score more points than they normally would for\nthe other Daredevil modes.  If a multiball is going on, you are very\nlikely to finish Daredevil Mania by earning 5 million unless you\ndrain.\n\nAs with the Daredevil Modes, Daredevil Mania points are not awarded\nuntil the end of the ball, so don't tilt if you want the points.\n\nFinishing Daredevil Mania is pretty important if you plan on... see\n\"Big Spoiler\" section for more.\n\n\n -- Itchy & Scratchy Multiball --\n\nWhen all four Itchy & Scratchy Multiballs have been played, put the\nball in the Itchy & Scratchy hole one more time to start...\n\n--- SCRATCHY'S REVENGE ---\n\nNote that Scratchy's Revenge starts anytime the ball goes into the\nItchy & Scratchy hole.  You do not need to complete the drop targets.\n\nScratchy's Revenge plays a lot like the other Itchy & Scratchy\nMultiballs, except that many Jackpots must be hit before the Super\nJackpot may be scored.  The required number of Jackpots is 15, less\nany Super Jackpots earned during the other four Itchy & Scratchy\nmultiballs.  The minimum required number is 5, regardless of how many\nSupers you got earlier.  In earlier ROM revisions, the required number\nof Jackpots is fixed at 10.\n\nSince starting the multiball still only kicks one ball onto the\nplayfield, it is strongly encouraged that you play Scratchy's Revenge\nin tandem with another multiball in order to get a Super Jackpot.  In\nparticular, Scratchy's Revenge plus Springfield Mystery Spot is\nperhaps the most valuable multiball combination in the entire game,\nsince Mystery Spot doubles all Jackpots and Super Jackpots.\n\nEach Jackpot is worth at least double what it normally is during Itchy\n& Scratchy Multiball.  Overall, it is quite possible to get more than\n30 million points from this multiball.\n\nGetting a Super Jackpot during this multiball is pretty important if\nyou plan on... see \"Big Spoiler\" section for more.\n\n\n -- Couch Multiball --\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you must get 5 Super Jackpots during Couch\nMultiball to earn progress toward... see \"Big Spoiler\" Section for\nmore.\n\n\n -- Cletus Kids --\n\nThere are 26 kids, so shoot Cletus 26 times to collect all the kids.\nThen, shoot Cletus one more time to start...\n\n--- PRETZEL MULTIBALL ---\n\nYou remember that one with all the pretzels?  Well, too bad.  It's\ngood Cletus action.  During this multiball, all switches score points\nand add pretzels.  After the required number of switches are\nactivated, a shot lights for Super Jackpot.  [Which one?  I think it's\nthe Right Ramp.]  Then repeat, more shots being needed to light the\nSuper.\n\nWhen starting Pretzel, two balls will kick out.  If starting Pretzel\nduring Couch, it will be a five-ball multiball (two more than whatever\nis already going).\n\nThe most valuable scoring in the game seems to come from Mystery Spot\n+ Pretzel + Scratchy's Revenge + Couch Multiball.  Sweet stackability.\n\n\n -- Secret Awards --\n\nThere are several buried secret point awards.\n\n - Max out bonus multiplier: 1 million bonus per Kwik-E-Mart shot.\n - Max out 1 skill shot: 1 million bonus.\n - Max out 2 skill shots: 2.5 million bonus.\n - Max out all 3 skill shots: 5 million bonus.\n - In Couch Multiball, score a 1x Jackpot, 2x Jackpot, and 3x Jackpot,\n   in that order: 2 million bonus.\n - Max timer at 60 seconds: 2.5 million bonus.\n\n[Other awards are probably still out there.  Find 'em!]\n\n\n--- Big Spoiler ---\n\nThis is a really BIG spoiler!  Don't read this unless you really,\nreally, want to know what happens.\n\n\n--- SPOILERS FOLLOW ---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- SPOILERS ---\n\nWhat?  You're still here?  Okay, here's the spoiler:\n\nBobo was a stuffed bear.\n\nJust kidding.  Here's the real info.\n\nFinish the six tasks listed above, then shoot any hole in single-ball\nplay.  And so begins...\n\n--- SUPER DUPER MEGA EXTREME WIZARD MODE ---\n\nYes, that is the actual name.  There isn't much fanfare generated by\nthe game, but quit your whining if you get that far and feel at all\nripped off.\n\nDuring this five-ball multiball, all shots do good stuff.  What good stuff?\n\n - Bumpers are 25,000, and spinner spins are 50,000.\n - All shots are lit for Jackpot, beginning at 500,000 and growing\n   50,000 on each travel down the Monorail.\n - Completing either bank of targets (Bully or Itchy & Scratchy) lights\n   a strobing shot for two different types of Super Jackpot, worth 5x\n   the regular Jackpot.\n - Locking a ball in the Couch multiplies Super Jackpots for about 20\n   seconds or so -- a timer will count down from 99, but it counts very\n   quickly.  The first lock doubles all Super Jackpots.  A second lock\n   before the countdown ends triples them.\n - Apparently lining up both strobing Super Jackpots at once does\n   something really good (\"Mega Jackpots\", the display taunts).  My\n   best guess at this is a 4x Super Jackpot I once got -- it was worth\n   16 million!  Yow.\n\nThe round ends when only one ball is left, and then the rest of your\ngame will have very little weather.  Or, rather, I mean it will be\nanti-climactic.  This mode seems to be good for somewhere between 50\nand 100 million points, which makes it valuable but not all-powerful.\n\n--- END SPOILERS ---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- END SPOILER SPACE ---\n\n\n--- Strategy Guide ---\n\nYour mileage may vary, so take these ideas at face value.  Watch out\nfor spoilers in the strategy guide.\n\n -- The Timer is Your Friend --\n\nYour #1 priority during the game should be the timer.  Having double\nscoring on a shot or setting up Victory points are well worth the\ntrouble, so you should give yourself every opportunity to keep the\ntimer in play.\n\nSo, in my opinion, the two most important shots in the game are the\nLight Otto standup and the Right Orbit.  These are the shots needed to\nkeep the timer going -- the other two (the Right Loop and TV Loop) are\nmuch easier to hit, and also easier to think of.  My personal strategy\nis to try to keep these two lit at all times, and it is the first\nthing I will try to do when the timer starts at 30 seconds.  The Light\nOtto standup can be hit as a reflex backhand from the left (I think it\nis safer that way).\n\nAnd yes, these same things apply MORE during multiball.  I think that\nin multiball, lighting and starting as many TV Modes and Otto scoring\nmodes as possible is more important than shooting for jackpots.  It\nmight seem counterproductive, but you're helping yourself reach the\nhigh-scoring opportunities later.  It's quite possible to do this\nstrategy and have nearly 10 things going on at once -- and at that\npoint, pretty much every shot in the game will score jackpot-level\npoints just in regular play what with all the modes running and the\ndoubling and the flavin.\n\n\"Oh, there's 5 seconds left, I'd better do something!\"  If you haven't\nhit the Otto standup or the Right Orbit, and you're down on time,\nyou're in trouble.  The best hope is the Right Orbit, since you might\nget some extra time from bouncing in the bumpers.  And don't forget\nabout the D'Oh Frenzy, which also resets the timer -- if you're close\nto spelling SIMPSONS, then shoot the Garage and get it started.\n\n -- Multiball Strategies --\n\nDuring Couch Multiball, I aim for the Right Orbit immediately to light\na TV Mode.  If you're going to aim for a Super Jackpot, you may as\nwell start a TV Mode while you're there -- those are worth 2 1/2\nmillion on their own, which is just as much as a good Super Jackpot.\n\nAnother good idea is to get Itchy & Scratchy -ready- by clearing the\ndrop targets.  Then, shoot for it when you're down to 2 balls (or, if\nyou're daring, when you're down to 1 ball!).  Getting these going\ntogether is very good for scoring.\n\nIf you are playing Itchy & Scratchy, don't forget that you can still\ndo everything you would normally do, including starting TV Modes, and\neven locking balls for Couch Multiball.  You can start Couch during\nI&S by getting to the upper playfield, but this is pretty tough.\n\nDon't ignore the timer!  You should still hit the Light Otto standup\nand the Right Orbit to keep those modes ready.  To me, it is easier to\nstart these during multiball than at any other time.\n\n -- Coordinating Big Scores --\n\nThe biggest scores in the game seem to come when you can coordinate\nthe game's high-scoring multiballs.  Specifically, Pretzel Multiball,\nCouch Multiball, Scratchy's Revenge, and Springfield Mystery Spot are\nhuge when combined in any way and really, really huge when they all\ncome together at once.  How huge?  Over 200 million points huge.\n\nSo, you need to have some idea how close you are to all these as you\nproceed.  Never, never start Scratchy's Revenge by itself, it is a big\nwaste when it is only a two-ball multiball (it's too hard).  If\npossible, keep track of where you are toward Pretzel.  Starting\nPretzel during a multiball kicks out two more balls than you started\nwith (typically ends up being all of them) and turns on a nice, meaty\nball saver.\n\n -- Victory Points and 2x Scoring --\n\nThe easiest way to get Victory points is to just start one TV Mode at\na time and complete it before starting another, and shoot Otto only\nwhen the timer is at risk (under 5-10 seconds left).  However, the\nVictory points are much greater when more TV Modes have been\ncompleted.  If you can, try starting as many TV Modes as you can right\naway, then shoot Otto to preserve the timer.  It is possible to get\nall 7 TV Modes started and completed -- and when that happens, EVERY\nshot is worth Super Jackpot points while the timer continues; if\nyou've got some Ottos going, too, each shot can become worth up to 5\nmillion.  How big is this?  Potentially over 600 million points on one\nball.\n\n -- TV Modes --\n\nThis is the order I play the 7 TV Modes in (hit the right flipper to\nchange selection):\n\n 1. Bart's Day\n 2. Stop the Monorail\n 3. Krusty's Last Stand\n 4. Duffman\n 5. Homer's Day\n 6. Wiggum vs. Snake\n 7. Willie's Woes\n\nWhy?  Overall I play them in order of difficulty, starting with the\nMOST difficult.  This is due to the timer: if you keep the timer\ngoing, you get more time on all modes in progress.  So, more time for\nthe tough modes.  Also, if the ball drains after the first few, I've\ngot only easy modes left to get a pretty decent run of Victory points.\n\nSome variation could be had: Krusty can make sense to be first, since\nyou have to shoot the spinner to light the next one anyway.  And if I\nsee Couch Multiball is lit, I'm taking Stop the Monorail regardless,\nso I can get credit for any ball that makes its way to the upper\nplayfield one way or the other.\n\n -- Alien Invasion --\n\nDon't bother -- it's not worth enough points.  Instead, start as many\nDaredevil modes as you can, since they are so easy to finish during\nInvasion.  If you want to finish it, the key is getting balls on the\nupper playfield as quickly as possible (say, during the ball saver).\nYou need to lock at least 1 ball there in stage three, and 2 balls in\nstage four.  If possible, lock the last ball in the Garage so it goes\non the upper playfield immediately when the next stage starts.\n\n -- Other Stuff --\n\nEnd-of-ball bonus can add up big, but there really isn't much strategy\nto it.  Just don't tilt and blow 30-50 million when it happens.\n\nHit the Lite/Lock targets with the upper left flipper, not the right.\n\nGet used to the timing on the Couch ramp shot, since this is a shot\nyou really, really want to be able to make consistently during Couch\nMultiball (and Invasion and...).\n\nHaving trouble with the Itchy & Scratchy shot?  Try backhanding the\nball off the \"Adv. Pops\" standup.  Or, during multiball, if you have\ntwo balls on the right flipper, any Itchy & Scratchy shot suddenly\nbecomes cake.\n\nWant to start a Daredevil mode cheaply?  Push the game forward!\n\nThe Garage, Right Loop, and Right Ramp can all be shot from either\nflipper.  Try it, it's fun.  No, seriously.\n\nJust got Crazy Extra Ball?  Quick, start a multiball.  Instant win.\n\nThat's all for now.  Please send me your strategies, and I'll add them\nto the sheet.\n\n\n--- High Score to Date ---\n\nIf you must know: 1,624,319,470.  Highest I know about, anyway.\n\nUntil next time...\n\n- Bowen\n\"So many buttons, so few brain cells...\"\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "The Simpsons Pinball Party", "possible_shots": "Left inlane / outlane, Lite Otto standup, Left (Cletus) Orbit, Pop Bumpers, Pop Target, Adv.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: South Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 South Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 1 May 18 1999\n\nCompiled by Robert Macauley\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nFirst let me get one thing perfectly clear. I don't like the cartoon series that this game is based on at all. However the same thing applies for a few other licensed games. South Park, and all characters from the series mentioned within this sheet are copyrighted by Comedy Central and used under license by SEGA. That should keep the lawyers off my back. And now, on with the show.\n\nThe Story So Far\nI've been putting off playing this game for quite a while. The location it was in left a lot to be desired. However, a local bowling alley now have a South Park with the volume turned up a looooong way. This sheet is based on 4 hours play over 2 days. The rom version is A1.00. The sound rom is unknown, but I think that it is the original uncensored version. Your mileage may vary.\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nStarting at the drain and going clockwise around:\nDrain: Same old bad news. No post on our machine.\nInlanes: Light both to start Super Fart Bumpers.\nOutlanes: Can be lit for special.\nBumpers: 3 in the standard formation. Same place as TZ. Balls exiting to the left are fed straight down into the left inlane.\nLeft Lane: A shot through the bumpers. Spots shots towards Stan.\nTargets: 1 target on each side for the left lane entrance. The right one awards 100k+100k per hit as _ assed monkey. The space being the number of times it has been hit.\nGate: A gate above the right bumper leading into the bumper area.\nTargets: 5 townsfolk targets. Used for the skill shot.\nMr Hankey: 3 targets in front of a toilet. Used to count down towards multiball and as a jackpot shot.\nChef Lane: Lane leading to a VUK just like the barbecue shot on Elvira. Spots shots towards Chef and can be lit for Extra Ball, Mystery and Spooky Vision. Balls from the left lane also end up here. Feeds to the area above the bumpers.\nKenny: A large rubber Kenny in front of a hole. Hit either to spot hits on Kenny.\nRamp: Used to spot shots on Kyle, start multiball and super jackpot. The ramp runs over the top of the toilet, which opens when appropriate. The ramp has an R shaped section above the bumper area and 3 possible exits. Balls can exit either through a hole into the bumpers, out a short drop towards the flippers or into the left inlane. There\u2019s a lot of posts here.\nTargets: 3 more townsfolk targets. These add 1M to the anal probe value during Cartman.\nCartman Hole: The return of the sinkhole from hell. Same size and position as the one on Star Wars Trilogy. Not as hard to hit due to a metal piece behind the hole. Used to spot hits on Cartman.\n\n\nObjective\n\nThe main aim of South Park is to start and COMPLETE all 5 character's modes. To start a mode you need to hit each character's shot a number of times. The number of shots required to start a mode increases with each successful completion. The modes for each character are as follows.\nStan: Shoot the left lane 4 times to start. Stan's mode is a 4 ball multiball based around the bumpers and the lane. Your objective is to kiss Stan's girlfriend 3 times. A kiss can be spotted either by a number of bumper hits or a shot to the lane. Shots to the lane are worth a bonus starting at 5M and increasing by 100k per bumper hit. After 3 kisses the display shows \"You Win\". You can still keep shooting the lane for points until 1 ball remains. The graphics for getting a kiss are gross.\nChef: Shoot the center lane 4 times to start Chef's mode. You have 30 seconds to shoot all 5 character's shots. The shots are worth 5M+1M per shot. The last shot is worth 10M. Each shot adds 5 seconds to the timer. Each shot adds a team member to a football team on the display. The COWS!\nKenny: Hit Kenny 4 times to start a hurry-up. Then hit Kenny again to collect the value and kill Kenny. The value starts at 10M. Killing Kenny produces one of several graphic deaths and the inevitable quote \"Oh my god, they've killed Kenny! You Bastards!\"\nKyle: Shoot the ramp 4 times to start Kyle's mode. The aim here is to shoot the ramp 4 times in 20? seconds to revive Mr Hankey. The shots are worth 5M, 10M, 15M and finally 20M.\nCartman: Shoot the hole 4 times to start Cartman's mode. You have 20 seconds to shoot the hole 3 times. Each shot awards 5M + 1M per hit on the 3 targets above the hole. Finishing awards the Anal Probe bonus.\nWhen you start a mode, the character's face on the playfield starts flashing. If the mode is completed the face lights solidly, otherwise it keeps flashing. Modes can be replayed regardless of they have been completed or not.\n\n\nWizard Modes\n\n\nSouth Park contains 2 wizard modes like Monster Bash. If you start all modes but fail to complete 1 or more, the Chef lane lights for Spooky Vision at the completion of the 5th mode. If you can complete all 5 modes, the red arrow in the Chef lane and the Volcano between the flippers light and shooting the Chef lane starts the real wizard mode called Volcano.\nSpooky Vision: Spooky Vision is a 5 ball multiball where the object is to raise the characters jackpot values by hitting their respective shots a set number of times. More info is required here.\nVolcano: Volcano is another 5 ball multiball where the object is to save South Park from an erupting volcano. You have to shoot 15 lit character shots for 10M apiece. If you are successful the flippers go dead, an extra ball is awarded and you begin the process again. Otherwise the mode ends when 1 ball is left in play. The total for a successful Volcano mode is 210M so there must be a 60M completion bonus.\nSpooky vision does not occur if all 5 modes are completed on the first attempt.\n\nMultiball\nThis is a bit confusing (to me at least). To light multiball you need to hit the Mr Hankey targets 5 times. Multiball will light at the ramp and until you shoot the ramp any hit to the Hankey targets adds 100k to the base jackpot value. Shoot the ramp to start. The toilet opens and the ball is fed to the right inlane. Multiball is yet another 5 ball affair. The Hankey targets are worth a base jackpot of 1M and each jackpot lights a character for a double jackpot. 5 Hankey jackpots lights the ramp for a super jackpot starting at 5M. I think collecting a super jackpot doubles the value of the next round of jackpots, however I could be wrong. The second super jackpot is worth 10M and each one after that is worth an extra 5M with no known limit. Multiball ends when 1 ball remains.\n\nMystery\nThe 3 targets above Cartman light the Chef lane for mystery. The awards known at this time are:\n\n+1 bonus X (very common)\n7M\nMr Mackey: A frenzy mode with all switches worth 500k for 30 seconds.\nThe charity extra ball is also available if your score is below 10M on ball 3.\n\n\n\nBonus\n\nThe bonus value is made up of the following:\n100k per shot to any character, the ramp or the townsfolk targets X the bonus X.\nThere is also an outlane drain bonus awarded sometimes worth 1M.\n\nSkill Shot\n\nHit the lit target below Mr Hankey for 5M+5M per successful skill shot.\n\nRandom Notes\nRule number 1, get all the character shots down. The Stan shot is a king size pain but it's well worth the effort. I absolutely hate shots through bumpers but in this case I'll make an exception.\nRule number 2, multiball, multiball, multiball. Any or all of them will do. The 3 multiballs are extremely unbalancing to this game. If you can play a few of each, a billion isn't out of the question. A trick to remember. The game can be tricked into awarding a left lane shot in multiball by shooting the Chef lane. Use this to your advantage.\nEntering the code LLRRLLRR in attract mode shows the design team credits.\n\nBragging\n639,809,810 including an 80M+ Stan mode.\nIf you have anything to add I can be reached at rjm91@hotmail.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "South Park", "manufacturer": "SEGA", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/southpark.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: South Park", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Space Jam, and\nany cartoon characters mentioned here are copyright Warner Bros and are\nof no concern to me. Michael Jordan also appears in the game and his name\nand image are also owned by someone, but I don't know who.\nThis guide is essentially freeware so use it as you wish but don't\ntry to make any money out of it and credit to the author and any other\ncontributers stays intact. So there!\n\nThe Story So Far\nThe Space Jam pinball appeared in the window of Dickesons Amusements\nin late October. This caused me to spend some more time drooling on their\nfront window (I must stop doing that). In mid November it replaced ID4\non site at ICA Sportsworks at Camden Park. In January the machine was updated\nand this guide was updated after 2 hours play on that version. I am now\nbanned from playing the game there. I left too many credits too often.\n\nMachine Version\n\nI'm not sure which version of the game I've been playing. Most of this\nsheet is based on a version A1.00.\n\nChanges To This Version\nThis is almost a complete re-write as the new software differs radically\nfrom the prototype that I had played. Many mode rules changed. Some input\nfrom Koi Morris and Vincent Bernardi added. Due to study commitments and\na lack of time this sheet has been seriously out of date.\n\nThe Movie\n\nSpace Jam, starring Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny and a host of Loony Tunes\ncharacters and Hollywood and NBA stars. I haven't seen it and I don't think\nI'll bother.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nStarting from the drain and going clockwise as usual:\nInlanes/ Outlanes--The usual. Each one spots a letter in Slam.\nThere is no kickback.\nSlingshots--Same as always.\nSPACE targets--5 targets all shaped like basketballs cut in half.\n1 each spelling SPACE.\nLeft Orbit--Spots Roadrunner. This is a standard orbit shot.\nCan be lit for Jackpot.\nLeft Ramp--I've called it a ramp but it's more like the cycle\njump on Comet. The aim is to jump the ball into a basket but this is harder\nthan it looks. The sweet spot is very narrow and as a result most shots\ndon't make it. Some land on the plastic habitrail from the right ramp which\ncounts the basket as a goaltend and awards the points, most shots land\nin the bumpers which scores nothing.\nCaptive Ball--To the left of the left ramp. Spots IN YER FACE\nand awards Super Jackpot when lit.\nBumpers--3 of them in the usual formation. In a similar position\nto the bumpers on Dr Dude. Awards a Rebound award after a set number of\nhits.\nSuper Duper Jackpot Target--A target in the very centre of the\nback of the playfield. Can be hit from the left flipper but most hits come\nfrom the bumpers. Serves no other purpose when not lit.\nMonstars Drop Targets--3 targets on the left side of the centre\nlane. Very similar to the targets on Space Shuttle. Can be hit from the\nright flipper but most hits come from rebounds off the bumpers. Awards\n100k for the 1st time down, starts In Yer Face mode the 2nd time and can\nalso be used during Shoot Drops mode.\nWabbit Hole--Mystery award. Lit by completing 23. This can be\nstacked.\nJump Shot--This is the lock lane. Shoot the ball up a lane through\na 1 way gate to light and collect locks. About 3 inches past the gate is\nthe Extra Ball target. Hard shots hit this. Balls locked are kicked out\nvia a VUK to a magnet which catches the ball. Then 1 of 2 kickers launch\nthe ball either around a loop and back to the left flipper, or straight\nto the right flipper at warp factor 9. Most balls go to the left. Can be\nlit for Jackpot.\nRight Ramp--Spots a letter in FIRE. Can be lit for double Jackpot.\n23 Targets--1 red target on each side of the right ramp entrance.\nLighting them both lights the Wabbit Hole.\nRight Orbit--Same as the left. Spots Tazmanian Devil. Can be\nlit for Jackpot.\nJAM Targets--3 targets spelling JAM.\nBetween the flippers is a post. This completely rules out doing Death\nSaves. On the machine I played, Bang Backs were extremely easy to do. The\nproblem was that the tilt setting was so sensitive that it always tilted.\n\nSkill Shot\nThe display shows Jordan lining up a free throw while the display cycles\nthrough a series of awards. You have to plunge the ball through a basket\nto collect the award you want. Pressing a flipper also changes the award.\nIf you make the basket you get the award. However if you press both flippers,\nthe game autolaunches the ball and awards you the skill shot even if you\nmiss.The awards include 300k, Wabbit Hole, super pops and multiball.\n\nThe Aim Of The Game\nThe object of Space Jam is to complete the 7 planets surrounding the\npicture of Michael Jordan in the lower playfield. Lighting them all lights\nthe ball in his hand for Final Jam.\n\nThe 7 Planets And How To Light Them\nThe 7 planets are as follows:\nSLAM--Complete the SLAM lanes once.\nIN YER FACE--3 hits on the captive ball.\nFIRE--4 shots to the right ramp. Completing fire lights the basket\nfor 10 point baskets for 23 seconds.\nSPACE JAM--Light all the SPACE and JAM targets. This starts Superjam.\nAll Jackpot shots and the captive ball are lit. Hit the 1st shot for 50k,\nthe 2nd shot for 150k and an extra 100k for each shot hit. Each shot can\nonly be hit once. The mode ends when all shots have been hit or after 45\nseconds.\nREBOUND--25 hits on the bumpers.\nFAST BREAK--5 shots to each orbit. Completing both orbits starts\nFast Break. The right ramp starts at 200k and counts up\nto 700k. Each shot to the ramp awards the fast break value.\nSUPER JACKPOT--Score a Super Jackpot during Multiball.\nLighting all 7 planets lights Final Jam. Shoot the left ramp to start\nthe mode.\nFINAL JAM--This is a 60 second \"Lost In The Zone\" type mode.\n5 balls are launched and the object is to shoot the basket. Each switch\nadds 10k to the award value and the basket collects this value.\n\nMultiball\nShoot the jump shot to light locks. For the 1st multiball 1 shot lights\nall 3 locks. The 2nd multiball requires 1 shot to light each lock. Then\n1 extra shot is needed for each subsequent multiball up to a maximum of\n5 shots. Shoot the jump shot again to award the lock. 3 locks starts multiball.\nDuring multiball the jackpots are as follows:\n1st wave--Both ramps lit for double jackpot. Shoot either one.\n2nd wave--Both orbits and the jump shot lit for jackpots. Shoot all\n3.\n3rd wave--Super jackpot lit at captive ball. Hit once to collect.\n4th wave--Shoot right ramp to light super duper jackpot for 15 seconds.\nHit the target to collect. If the timer expires shoot the ramp again.\nAfter collecting the super duper jackpot the sequence starts again\nbut this time both ramps must be hit in the 1st wave.\nJackpot values are :\nBase value 500k.\nSuper Jackpot base value 3mil.\nSuper Duper Jackpot base value 5mil.\nSwitch hits increase jackpot values by 1000 per hit.\n\nWabbit Hole\nThe Wabbit Hole is a mystery award which is lit by lighting both of\nthe 23 targets. Wabbit hole awards can be stacked and carry over from ball\nto ball until collected. When hit 3 awards are displayed like Mr DNA on\nJurassic Park with Bugs Bunny pointing at each award with a carrot. The\nmachine picks 1 award from the 3 shown.\nSome awards are:\n300,000 pts--Fairly self explanatory.\n1 on 1--One shot is lit and you have 45 seconds to make the shot.\nMaking the shot awards 100k (I think) and a quote and picture of Jordan\nmaking a basket from weirder and weirder locations. The mode ends after\nmaking 6 shots or when time runs out.\n2 on 2--2 ball multiball. Shoot the right ramp or jump shot for\n100k. This lights the left ramp for 10 seconds. Shooting the basket scores\n300k.\nVideo Mode--Move a basket to catch 16 balls thrown by Jordan\nand 4 Loony Tunes characters. Each catch is worth 50k + a 200k bonus for\ncatching all 16.\nDefence--Hurry up mode. The drop targets are lit starting at\n470k and counting down to 100k. A hit on the drop targets locks the value\nand starts Blowout. All jackpot shots are worth the locked value for 30\nseconds.\n10X Bonus--Have a guess.\nLite EB\nFree Game--I've never seen it awarded.\nFinal Jam--If this is ever awarded it would have to be a very\nrare occurrence.\nHold Bonus\nTrivia Game--Asks a question and you choose the answer with the\nflippers. The questions I've seen are all about Michael Jordan's career.\nFull Court Frenzy--All arrow shots are lit. 5 balls are launched\nand each arrow shot scores the frenzy value. This value starts at 200k\nand each switch hit adds 100 to the value. This mode has a long ball save\nso the points can be HUGE!!\n\nMisc. Scoring\nIn Yer Face Mode--Completing the drop targets for the 2nd time\nstarts In Yer Face mode. The captive ball is lit for 30 seconds (??) and\neach hit awards 150k (??). 3 hits ends the mode.\nBonus X--Lighting all 4 SLAM lanes advances the bonus X. Reaching\n6X lights EB at the jump shot. All completions after that score 200k. Slam\ncan't be spotted during modes or multiballs.\nFun With Bonus--The bonus count is made up of 10k for each basket,\norbit, ramp and jump shot multiplied by the bonus X. There is also a bonus\nfor each planet spotted.\nBasket Points-- Shooting the basket or the captive ball during\n1 ball non mode play will score basket points. 2 points for the captive\nball, 3 points for the left ramp or 10 points during Fire mode or for a\nsuper skill shot. 23 pts scores 300k and 45 pts scores an EB. There must\nbe other awards.\n\nRandom Notes\nNot a lot to say really. The 1st thing you notice is the curved backbox.\nI would like this game a lot more if there was a bit more depth to it.\nThe hardest part of reaching final jam is the super jackpot and even that\nis obtainable. The idea of setting tasks to reach the wizard award is nothing\nnew and unlike Attack From Mars this isn't much of a challenge.\nReally all there is to it is keep shooting for multiball and the rest\nshould fall into place. Only 1 mode can run at a time and anything else\nis paused during multiball. The skill shot can start multiball for you\non ball 3 but it's not that hard to get anyway.\nThe ball save has no grace period and neither do any of the modes.\nBalls down the outlanes don't trigger the ball save until they reach the\ntrough.\nMy opinions of this game were not too good at first but with the new\nsoftware rom the game has improved 200%. I still think this game could\nbe a little better but considering the target audience for the movie, the\ngame should appeal to them.\nThe tilt quote is possibly the coolest in pinball history. Tweety saying\n\"Bad ol Pinball Player\". On the subject of Tweety, if the ball drains down\nan outlane on ball 3 Tweety appears on the display and makes a comment\nabout losing the ball. If you flip both flippers during this, Sylvester\nappears and eats the little $%@#. Some other quotes are slightly funny\nat first but the novelty soon wears off.\nSome of the graphics are very good including some digitised footage\nof M J in action.\nThe left ramp is near impossible to make consistently.\nOverall not as bad as I first thought.\n\nLeague and Wizard Mode\nHold the left flipper and press start for League mode.\nHold the right flipper and press start for Wizard mode.\nNo known difference yet except the Wabbit Hole awards are the same\nfor each player in League mode.\n\nBragging\nHigh Score so far 94 Million.

I\ndon't seem to have acquired the 'style' of the other rules writers.  Also,\nit seems a bit on the short side, but then again the rule set isn't that\ndeep anyway.  Consider it a first draft, and I'll think about improving it\nat some point.  Please feel free to criticise (constructively) both the\nstyle and the content.\n\nRules for Space Station\n\n'Space Station' and 'Multiball' are trademarks of Williams Electronic\nGames Inc.\n\nThis rule sheet is by Steve Loft.  All descriptions are based on\nfactory settings; see the section 'Difficulty Levels' for a\ndescription of the operator adjustments.\nConfiguration\n3 Jet Bumpers.\n\nBank of 7 targets to left side, spells 'SHUTTLE'.\n\nBank of 3 targets roughly in centre of playfield, and bank of 4 targets\nto right side, together spelling 'STATION'.\n\nBank of three drop targets, increases bonus multiplier.\n\n'Mini' playfield, with 3 lanes, lights '1-2-3'.\n\n3 further lanes underneath mini-playfield, lights 'U-S-A'.\n\nLeft hand and right hand ball locks.\n\nRamp to right of playfield, takes ball to either lock, depending on\nposition of Space Station divertor (see below).\n\nDrop target which more or less blocks entry to ramp while raised (although\nramp entry is still possible with the target raised).\n\nCentre ball popper, accessible from shot around left and back of playfield,\npast the U-S-A lanes.  Exit from ball popper is to either lock, depending\non position of Space Station divertor (see below).\n\nRight hand ball popper, accessible from shot slightly to the right of the\ncentre of the playfield, past the drop targets.  Exit from this ball popper\nis to the mini playfield.\n\nSpace Station.  This is a divertor which rotates (counter clockwise, when\nit's working properly, which mine often isn't) such that a ramp shot will\nalways put the ball into an empty lock (assuming there is one).\nIf the centre ball popper is entered while one ball is locked, however, the\nball will be held in the popper and the space station will rotate before the\nball is popped, thus sending it into the empty lock.\n\nSingle target to right hand side of playfield.\n\nTwo standard flippers.\n\nStandard plunger.\n\nNo inlanes.\n\nKickback on left hand outlane.\nObject of the game\nDock two balls in left and right locks \"LIBERTY DOCKED\", \"DEFENDER DOCKED\",\nthen shoot centre or right ball poppers to start Multiball \"NEGATIVE - YOU MUST\nRE-DOCK\".  Re-dock two balls to win Rescue Jackpot \"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED\".\nGame Play\nA habitrail takes the ball from the plunger to the mini-playfield.  There is\nno skill shot.  At the start of each ball, the awards for making SHUTTLE and\nSTATION are randomised, and displayed on two banks of lights set into the\nmiddle of the playfield.  Shooting the single target to the right of the\nplayfield again randomises one of these, depending on whether it is lit for\nshuttle or station.  The awards for making SHUTTLE or STATION are:\n\n\n Special\n Extra ball\n 50,000 + relights kickback\n 50,000 + bonus ball\n 150,000 + hold bonus\n 75,000\n 25,000\n\n\n\nBonus Ball  The 'bonus ball' mentioned above is a timed extra ball at the end\nof the game.  This normally lasts 25 seconds, but is increased to 45 seconds if\nyou have achieved Multiball during the game.  If you drain during bonus ball,\nthe ball is sent back to the plunger; the ball only ends when the time runs\nout.\n\nStop 'N' Score   This is started by hitting the drop target in front of the\nramp.  This starts a 25 second timer, during which a score repeatedly counting\nfrom 20,000 to 99,000 is displayed.  Making the ramp shot awards whatever score\nis displayed at that time, multiplied by the Stop N Score multiplier.  The\nmultiplier is advanced by making U-S-A (see below).\n\nU-S-A   Making U-S-A (the three lanes underneath the mini-playfield) advances\nthe Stop 'N' Score multiplier, up to a maximum of 5X.  Making 4X lights the\nsingle 'randomise' target to the right of the playfield for a special.\n\n1-2-3   Making 1-2-3 (the three lanes on the mini-playfield) increases the\njet bumper score.  The jet bumper score starts at 500, and increases by 500\neach time 1-2-3 is completed, up to a maximum of 3,000.  Making 1-2-3 also\nrelights the 'Dock when lit' lights.\n\nDrop Targets   Making the bank of 3 drop targets increases the end-of-ball\nbonus multiplier, up to a maximum of 7X.  Making 4X lights extra ball, awarded\nby making the drop targets a further time.\n\nCentre Ball Popper   Awards 100,000 when lit.  Pops the ball into either the\nleft dock (via a habitrail) or right dock depending on the position of the\nSpace Station, and whether a ball is already docked.  If 'Dock W/L' is not lit\nthe ball will immediately be ejected from the dock.  Making the centre popper\nwhen two balls are already docked starts Multiball.\n\nRight Ball Popper   Pops the ball to the mini playfield.  Starts Multiball if\ntwo balls are docked.\n\nRamp   Sends ball to either dock depending on the position of the Space\nStation. Awards Stop N Score if activated.  Making the ramp when two balls are already\ndocked causes the ball already in the dock to be ejected and replaced by the\nball in play.\n\nMultiball   Docking two balls and making either of the ball poppers starts\nMultiball.  Re-Docking two balls awards the Rescue Jackpot, which starts at\n200,000 and increases by 10,000 each time Multiball ends without re-docking.\nAfter a Multiball, 1-2-3 must be made before a ball can be docked again.\n\nRight Outlane   Scores 100,00 when lit.\n\nDifficulty Levels\nThe following features are operator-configurable (as well as the usual stuff\nsuch as high scores and balls per play):\n\n\nBonus Ball Time  20 to 40 seconds.  Factory setting: 25 seconds.\n\nStop N Score Timer  5 to 30 seconds.  Factory setting: 25 seconds.\n\nU-S-A lights special  3 to 5 completions.  Factory setting: 4 completions.\n\nSHUTTLE memory  Whether SHUTTLE lights are remembered for next ball.  Factory\nsetting: YES.\n\nSTATION memory  Whether STATION lights are remembered for next ball.  Factory\nsetting: YES.\n\n1-2-3 memory  Whether 1-2-3 lights are remembered for next ball.  Factory\nsetting: YES.\n\nU-S-A memory  Whether U-S-A lights are remembered for next ball.  Factory\nsetting: YES.\n\nKickback lit at start of ball   Factory setting: YES.\n\nDOCKING W/L lit at start of game   Factory setting: YES.\n\nBonus multiplier memory   Whether bonus multiplier carried forward to next\nball.  Factory setting: NO.\n\nStop N Score memory   Whether Stop N Score multiplier carried forward to next\nball.  Factory setting: NO.\n\nBumper value memory   Whether jet bumper value carried forward to next ball.\nFactory setting: YES.\n\nBonus multiplier lights extra ball  Adjustable from 3X to 7X.  Factory\nsetting: 4X.\n\nPlaying tips\nIt is relatively straightforward for a reasonable player to master the ramp\nshot off the left flipper and thus be able to dock two balls.  The shot for\nthe right hand popper to start multiball is also quite easy.  A favourite\nshot of mine is from the right flipper, taking out the three drop targets\nand going on to enter the right hand popper.  Re-docking when in Multiball\nrequires just two ramp shots.  For this reason, the Rescue Jackpot\nnever seems to get very high (although Multiball is undoubtedly the most fun\npart of the game).  The big scores, in my opinion,  are obtained by making the\nU-S-A lanes to increase the Stop N Score multiplier to 5X, then starting\nStop N Score and timing your ramp shot such that you get as near to 99,000\n(times 5) as possible.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Space Station", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/spacestation.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Space Station", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBally's Spectrum\nBy Dan Mowczan, dano@ic.net\n\nVersion 1.0\n\nI. History\nSpectrum is a 3 ball game with a codebreaker theme from Bally. It was designed by Claude Fernandez, and the art was done by Margaret Hudson. Claude also designed such games as Flash Gordon, Elektra, Baby Pac-Man, and Phantom of the Opera. It had a production run of 994 machines, with rumors of a significant number of machines never being sold (see rumors). It was a complex game that didn't perform particularly well on locations.\nSpectrum was a unique game for several reasons. Although there were three balls installed, only a single ball was intended to be in play at any time. Secondly, no plunger is present on the machine. It is an Add-A-Ball machine, which was rarely used in the 1980s. There are no outlanes -- balls can only be drained between the flippers. Finally, the absence of a plunger will confuse most people at the beginning of their first few games.\nII. Playfield\nDue to the fact that the Spectrum playfield is 100% symmetrical in construction, I will not describe the playfield clockwise from the bottom left, as is the convention. I will describe the playfield from the bottom up. Features of the playfield beyond the basic mechanics will be discussed near the end of this section.\nDrain Saucer\nBetween the flippers, there is a saucer, which holds a single ball whenever a ball is not in play. This ball is launched up between the flippers to begin play, due to the lack of a plunger lane for that purpose.\nFlippers\nThe flippers are of the standard Bally type for this era. The only unique feature worth mentioning is that the gap between the flippers is abnormally large. Due to the absence of outlanes to drain a ball, the game required a larger gap at the bottom to equalize play. The distance between the two flippers (from rubber to rubber) is 2 7/16\"!\nWedges\nIn the standard location of pinball slingshots, two triangular wedges are placed at these locations. They do look like standard slingshots, but perhaps are a bit smaller. They do not have switches and slingshots to propel the ball, and only serve the purpose of forming inlanes. Slingshots are primarily designed to bounce the ball back and forth, increasing the danger of dropping a ball in an outlane, and are not required in this case.\nInlanes and trapped balls\nThe inlanes are typical for any machine. However, a trapped ball is located on each side of the machine. It is on the outside of the inlane, level with the portion of the lane leading up to the flipper. This ball can be launched (quite quickly) down the inlane towards the flipper. If not reacted to quickly, it will certainly drain. A \"Special\" lamp is located near each inlane entrance.\nComputer Code Array\nA large picture of a box, being about eight inches across and spanning from the bottom of the wedges up to the computer clue saucers is the code array. The array is made up of 12 cells, in a 3 across by 4 high array. Each cell in the array contains four lamps, one each of the colors red, yellow, green, and blue. Your successful and unsuccessful attempts to break the current 4 color code are shown here (see gameplay).\nComputer Clues Saucers\nAbout 5 inches from the top of the wedges, there is a pair of saucers that is easily accessible from most any angle. Each one ejects the ball into the hidden side lanes. Each of these saucers has two arrows which can be lit leading up to them. The left one has a red and yellow arrow, and the right one has a green and blue arrow.\nStars and Super Star\nLocated above the computer code array is four stars and one super star. These are lamps in the playfield that indicate the number of computer codes that you have successfully broken. (see gameplay)\nColor Drop Targets, Red and Blue\nAbout four inches above the computer clues saucers there is a set of three drop targets located on each side on the machine. They are approximately a 50-degree angle from horizontal pointed towards the flippers. The set on the left is blue and the set on the right is red. Each set is labeled clearly with its color on the silkscreen plastic above it, and says SHOOT (color) WHEN FLASHING.\nBonus Rollovers\nLocated about two inches above the top of the red and blue drop targets is a set of four rollovers stretching across the playfield in a tiny arc.\nSpinners\nAt the outsides of the machine, right above about 1 1/2\" above the bonus rollovers, two spinners is angled about 15 degrees from horizontal, facing the flippers. These spinners each have two arrows pointing towards them which can be lit. The left one has a green and blue arrow and the right one has a red and yellow arrow.\nColor Drop Targets, Yellow and Green\nThese two sets of three drop targets are located near the center of the of the machine, about 3/4 of the way up from the bottom. They allow enough space for a ball to travel between them comfortably. They are angled at about 5 degrees from horizontal and are facing the flippers. As with the red and blue set, each set is labeled clearly with its color on the silkscreen plastics above them, and say SHOOT (color) WHEN FLASHING.\nSpectral Curve\nThe Spectral Curve is a large arc starting at the left spinner, arcing over the yellow and green drop targets, and exiting on the right spinner. A successful shot into the spectral curve should be from a flipper, travel through the spinner on the opposite side of the playfield, arc over one set of drop targets pass the gap allowing access to the top saucer, over the other set of drop targets, and into the hidden side lane on the side of the playfield that the original shot came from. Four rollovers are located above the drop targets on the spectral curve to track the balls position in it.\nTop Saucer\nAt the highest point of the machine, a center saucer is located. It is recessed fully and can only be hit from a very accurate upward shot from the flippers. It has the ability to eject the ball to the right or left, which sends the ball directly into the hidden side lanes. The ball passes over three rollovers to track its progress getting kicked into the hidden side lanes. This saucer has four lighted arrows (red, yellow, green, and blue) leading up to it. It is also labeled Computer Clues like the lower two saucers.\nHidden Side Lanes\nThis is one of the features that make Spectrum very unique. These side lanes are completely invisible to the player, as they completely obscured by opaque silk-screened plastics. They begin at the top, arced up to the top saucer, and at the bottom they empty into the ball reservoir on the inlanes. Three rollovers are visible at the top to track the ball's progress from the top saucer into the hidden side lanes. A ball can enter the hidden side lanes at four points on the playfield -- kicked out of the top saucer, on the spectral curve, between the spinners and the red and blue drop targets, and out of the lower computer clues saucers.\nIII. Gameplay\nThe goal in Spectrum is to break the computer's code. Gameplay is begun by pressing the right flipper button, which ejects the ball sitting in the drain saucer into the playfield by firing it up between the flippers.\nCodes\nThe Computer's Code, which is kept secret from the player, is made up of a sequence of four colors. Each of the four colors is Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue. Colors can repeat in the code, so all four colors are not required to be used in the code. A new code is determined at the start of each game and immediately after the old code is broken.\nReading the Computer Code Array\nThe computer code array, located centrally in the lower half of the playfield, is what keeps track of your correct and incorrect guesses. The three columns in the array initially keep track of your first, second, and third attempt at breaking the code. If you have to make more than three attempts at breaking the computer code, the attempt records are pushed one column to the left. Attempts pushed off the left of the grid are lost, and these guesses cannot contribute to your bonus scoring at the end of each ball (see Scoring).\nThe four rows indicate the guesses at each of the four colors in the code's sequence. The top row corresponds to the first color in the code, and the bottom row corresponds to the last color in the code.\nEach of the twelve cells in the array contains four controlled lamps. The lamps are red, yellow, green, and blue. The state of the lamps can tell you about a particular position guess (row) of a certain code guessing attempt (column).\n\nAll lamps dark: Not yet ready to guess this position on this attempt \nOne light solid: Guessed this color for this position on this attempt, it was incorrect. \nOne light flashing: Guessed this color for this position on this attempt, it was correct. \nFour lamps alternating quickly: Currently making this attempt.\nEach of the cells must be filled in order. In other words, the first guess you'll make will be the first color in the codes, the second guess will be the second color, etc. You cannot proceed to the next position in the code without guessing the previous one, and you cannot start a new codebreaking attempt without completing all your guesses on the last one.\nTaking guesses\nWhen the game begins, the first position on the first attempt will have the four color lamps flashing in a circular pattern. This indicates that you're ready to take a guess at what the color is for that position in the secret code.\nTo take a guess, you need to strike two of the three bank targets of the color you want to guess. Immediately after sinking two of three targets of any color bank, the bank is reset and that is your guess if that color is currently allowed to be guessed (see Computer Clues). If the guess is legal, it is applied to the computer code array. The light in the cell is either turned on solid if the guess is incorrect or flashing if the guess is correct. The next cell on the grid immediately starts rotating colors indicating that you are ready to move on to your next guess.\nComputer Clues\nOf course, randomly guessing at the code won't get us anywhere. Three computer clues saucers on the board will give you a hint as to what the computer's code is.\nThe two side saucers each have two arrows pointing at them. The left saucer has a red and yellow lamp which defaults to yellow, and the right saucer has a green and blue arrow which defaults to blue. The lit arrow pointing at the saucer can be changed by hitting the spinner on the opposite side of the playfield. There is another set of arrows facing the spinners that duplicate the arrows pointing at the saucers for clarity. Each spin toggles between the two sets of two colored arrows pointing at the spinner and the corresponding saucer. If a clue has already been given out by the side saucers relating to a color, that color will not light again until you move on to a new guess.\nThe top saucer has arrows of all four colors pointing to it. Instead of being lit on a specific color, this top saucer's arrows rotate approximately every one second. Depending on the timing with which you hit the top saucer, clues are issued based on the currently lit arrow. Again, if a clue has already been issued for a specific color from the top saucer, that color will not light again until you move onto a new guess.\nWhen you land in a computer clues saucer, you are immediately rewarded with some information about the current guess you are making. The lit arrow is what color you will get a clue about.\n\nIf the color would not be a correct guess, the machine announces \"Not (color).\" The light above those bank targets go out, and that color can no longer be guessed by hitting two bank targets -- but only for that particular guess. \nIf the color would be the correct guess, the arrow starts flashing, and all the bank targets except that color are disabled. At this point, you cannot guess wrong -- you make your guess by hitting 2 of 3 bank targets, or you hit the same saucer that has the flashing arrow.\nNote that when you get a clue about a color that would be a correct guess, only the arrow starts flashing on the saucer that you got the clue from. For example, you cannot get a clue from the left saucer and then hit the top saucer to collect a correct guess, you have to hit the same left saucer. The top saucer continues to operate as normal and will give you information about whatever color you hit, even though you already know the proper guess to make.\nMaking Progress\nAs you make guesses, the computer code array will slowly fill up with your guesses. After completing four guesses, any correct guesses are already spotted for you in the next column in the computer code array. You'll have to redo incorrect guesses. When you lose your last ball, the computer displays the code you were trying to guess in the rightmost column of the computer code array.\nAlthough you may have guessed incorrectly earlier on colors, you can still guess the same incorrect color again. Remember, getting computer clues will disable sets of bank targets, but just knowing what an incorrect guess previously was doesn't automatically disable bank targets. Often, you will know what color to shoot for even if you have more than one set of bank targets still active, due to your knowledge of previous failed guesses.\nCracking the Code\nOnce you crack the code, the machine will announce your success and spot you a star. A star is only a counter of the number of successfully cracked codes, and delivers points at the end of the game. After getting four stars, the next cracked code awards a Super Star. When a super star is awarded the older four stars are taken away.\nBonus Multiplier\nThe bonus multiplier starts at 1x, and grows to 2x, 3x, and 4x. In order to increment the bonus multiplier, you need to light all four of the rollover targets just above the middle of the playfield. Operator settings determine several factors:\n\nWhether or not the bonus multiplier is held from ball to ball \nWhether or not you must get the rollovers in order from left to right \nWhether or not you hold lit rollovers from ball to ball\nAdd A Ball\nIn order to add a ball to the balls remaining for play, you need to complete the spectral curve. Shooting a ball from a flipper, through a spinner, around the spectral curve, and into the opposite hidden side lanes awards one of two spectral lights on that side of the spectral curve. Completing all four spectral lights adds a ball to your balls remaining to play. Operator settings determine whether or not lit spectral lights carry over from ball to ball.\nInlane reservoir ball kickout\nThe inlane reservoirs each hold a ball ready to be shot down the inlane. This ball is kicked out of play immediately upon a ball entering the hidden side lane at any time. Basically, if a ball drifts into the hidden side lane through any of the access points or lands in a ball saucer, the ball at the bottom is immediately kicked into play, and replaces the current ball in play. While you're playing it, the ball that entered the hidden side lane makes it way down to the reservoir, ready to be kicked out next time a ball entered that hidden side lane.\nSince the top saucer has the ability to kick the ball into either hidden side lane, you really do not know which side lane the ball is coming out of. The ball at the top isn't kicked down a hidden side lane until the reservoir delivers the ball into play, making sure that you have no clue as to where the ball is going to shoot out from. Getting used to this is somewhat difficult, and causes a great deal of frustration on your first few plays.\n\nIV. Scoring\n\nPlayfield Scoring\n\n\nInlanes\n\n2000\n\n\nSide Computer Clue Saucers\n\n5000\n\n\nAny Drop Target\n\n5000\n\n\nSpinners\n\n1000\n\n\nBonus Multiplier Rollover\n\n300\n\n\nSpectral Curve Rollover\n\n500\n\n\nTop Saucer\n\n10000\n\n\nRollovers leading to hidden side lanes*\n\n10\n\n\nCompleting Spectral Curve\n\n25000 + Extra Ball\n\n\n\n*Only two of the rollovers leading to the hidden side lanes score 10, the other does nothing. So, a successful top saucer shot will award 10020. A shot into the top saucer area that sneaks down the hidden side lanes without collecting a clue is worth 20.\nBonus Scoring\nBonus scoring is collected at the end of each ball. You are awarded 5000 points for every incorrect guess on the computer code array, and 10000 points for every correct guess. Your current bonus multiplier multiplies these scores.\nEnd of Game Scoring\nAt the end of the game, you are given credit for every Star and Super Star that you collected by breaking codes. 100000 is awarded for each Star and 500000 is awarded if you have the Super Star.\nSpecial codebreaking bonuses\nAfter breaking the second code, a single special is lit on one of the two inlanes. The spinners will make this alternate from inlane to inlane. The fourth code broken awards both special lanes lit, but once one is collected the other disappears.\nWhen you complete a code that contains 3 yellow, 4 yellow, 3 red, or 4 red, a special bonus is immediately awarded to the player. These bonus are optional, and can be turned on or off by the operator. There are several different settings for these, and they range from 25000 points up to 3 specials. I have no documentation on what levels can be set, but these are the largest and smallest awards I have seen when the bonuses are enabled.\nV. Strategy\nSpectrum is a fast paced game where the huge flipper gap makes sure that any missed shot has the potential for disaster. First and foremost, hitting your targets is the single most important skill at any time.\nAnother important step is to load up the Computer Code Array as quickly as possible -- even with incorrect guesses. Basically, you're bound to make some right guesses even without clues, and if you don't get as many guesses as you can on the array early, the bonus point payout is likely to be poor. In addition, making incorrect guesses gives you information about what colors you should be shooting for.\nThe spectral curve is an important shot, and looks deceptively easy. Making sure you can hit this shot fairly often should keep you in an ample supply of balls.\nFinally, the top saucer is the easiest way to collect information about the clues, and its worth twice as many points as the side computer clue saucers. Make sure that you are able to hit it often. When any saucer has a flashing arrow, collecting that guess by hitting the saucer is always safer than shooting for the bank targets, which are all angled towards the drain.\nVI. Speech\nSpectrum is a very talkative game. It says a number of things throughout the game and keeps talking at all times.\nHere's a list of the speech in the game:\n\n\n\nChallenge Me\n\nAttract Mode\n\n\nFour (yellow or red)\n\nWhen you break a code that has four yellow or red positions and you collect a special code bonus\n\n\nGet a clue\n\nDuring play when no arrows are flashing\n\n\nGet another clue\n\nDuring play, at least one clue collected, no arrows flashing\n\n\nGo for (color)\n\nWhen that color arrows is flashing\n\n\nGo for (Left, Right, Top) Saucer\n\nWhen a flashing arrow is pointing at this saucer\n\n\nGo for Spectrum\n\nAttract Mode\n\n\nNot (color)\n\nWhen landing in a clue saucer that has a lit arrow that is not the next correct guess\n\n\nOne More Game, Perhaps?\n\nEnd of a game\n\n\nOne more guess for a star\n\nPlayer one guess away from breaking the code\n\n\nPlayer (number)\n\nBeginning of Multi-player game balls\n\n\nSpectrum\n\nBeginning of game, sometimes when a code is broken, attract mode\n\n\nThree (yellow or red)\n\nWhen you break a code that has three yellow or red positions and you collect a special code bonus\n\n\nUse Right Flipper\n\nPlayer taking too long to begin play\n\n\nYou are a star player\n\nWhen player breaks code\n\n\nYou are a super star player\n\nWhen player breaks a code that awards the Super Star\n\n\nYou have broken the secret code!\n\nWhen player breaks code\n\n\nYou shouldn't do that!\n\nTilt or ball saved by score of 0\n\n\nYou're Taking too long!\n\nPlayer still taking too long to start play, ball is shot into play automatically\n\n\nVII. Rumors\nSpectrum had a production run of 994 games.\nHowever, one collector on the net told me (and I cannot remember who it was) that he received his spectrum for free from a distributor that couldn't sell them. At one time, sales were so bleak that Bally was giving away a free Mr. and Ms. Pac-Man if you purchased a Spectrum. After poor sales, about half of the machines were disassembled, parts returned to inventory, backglasses stripped of paint, and cabinets tossed.\nVIII. Other Information\nThe art theme depicts a large number of computer wires and circuits all over the playfield, plastics, cabinet, and glass. A dominant theme running through the art is a man and woman, from the neck up, facing in opposite directions. They're placement is symmetrical, once on the backglass and once on the playfield. There is another humanoid representing the computer -- it is a bald female and is twice on the center axis of the game from top to bottom. Most of the games details also rotate around the red, yellow, green, and blue theme.\nApparently ROM revisions of 0 and prior, which shipped in early production games, did not award any Add-A-balls.\nThis game uses the Squalk 'n' Talk board for speech. It has two lamp driver boards due to the large number of controlled lamps installed.\nIX. Bugs\nThe most common strange occurance in spectrum is that a ball falling down a hidden side lane to the reservoir falls past the reservoir and into play. Basically, you have more than one ball in play, but the machine realizes something is missing and handles it properly. If you loose your ball down the middle, the lost ball is kicked immediately back into play. When the empty hole is filled by a ball falling into the hidden side lane in any way, the game goes back to normal. Any shot into the top saucer will not send the ball a random direction, but will always send it in the proper direction to fill the empty reservoir.\nX. Comments\nThis is my first rule sheet, and I've found Spectrum fairly hard to describe. It was really not like many other games available at the time, and if you have the chance to play one, please do. You'll do much better understanding exactly what made the game unique. In fact, if you ever pass near the Detroit area, just write me at dano@ic.net and come play mine.\nPlease forward any information to me that you see that I am missing about the game.\nXI.

You will, of course, be\ncredited for information you provide.\nPlayfield\n\nFlippers  Normal Gottlieb Catch-All(tm) flippers.\n\nSlingshots  Pretty normal as well.\n\nLeft inlane  Opens up the \"Trade Quartz\" shot if it is not already open.\nNotice that the habitrail does NOT go over the inlane switch.  The\nbest way to trigger the inlane is to shoot the pop bumpers and hope\nit goes down the left.\n\nLeft outlane  Leads to the...\n\nSarcophagus  This is a kickback, but not your ordinary kickback!  It is\nactually a gate that opens up to reveal a underneath-the-scorecard\nspace that can hold the ball and kick it out whenever it wants.\nThe kickback opens up when the ball comes out of the pop bumpers\nvia the Extra Ball rollover and when on the habitrail leading to\nthe outlane.  The game may also be set to open the Sarcophagus after\nhitting the right slingshot and close when hitting the left.  This is\na Segment.\n\nExtra Ball rollover  The leftmost way out of the pop bumper area; it\nthe opening of the Sarcophagus and awards an extra ball when lit.\n\n3-bank  A bank of 3 drop targets, located on the way out of the\nSarcophagus above the left slingshot.  Each has a light pointing to\nit, going from left to right:  5M, 10M, 20M.  This scoring is\ndiscussed in detail in the drop targets section.\n\nPop bumpers  There are two (2) of them in a pretty enclosed area.  Get to\nthem by shooting the right entrance (towards the left Guardian); the\nball will exit back through that area or down the extra ball\nrollover.  There is also a small kicker-target on the right.\n\nLeft Guardian  It guards the entrance to the left lane and has a white\nround standup target on the bottom of it.  Going through the right\ninlane will open the Guardian as will shooting the standup.  If you\nshoot the standup, though, you get the added bonus of lighting the\nTransporter.  Note the Guardian is open at the start of a ball for a\nflipper skill shot if you blow the Sarcophagus skill shot.\n\nLeft lane  Leads into the pop bumpers/Left Guardian and into Transporter if\nthe Guardian is raised.  The start of the shot is flanked by a 3-bank\nof drop targets to the left and a 2-bank of drop targets to the\nright.  It is also a White Pyramid (see that section) shot.  (Hitting\nthe standup will also count for the White Pyramid.)\n\n2-bank  A bank of 2 drop targets located about halfway up the playfield\nfacing more towards the right than the bottom.  The bottom one is\nmarked with a 40M light and the top one with an 80M light.  See the\ndrop target section for details.\n\nLeft ramp  This is a way steep ramp, and while it has quite a large\nentrance, its sweet spot is deceptively narrow.  Aim for the middle\nof the ramp and not the sides in order to have a better chance of\nmaking it up.  It feeds to the left inlane, though not over the\ninlane rollover.  It starts the Combo sequence (see that section\nfor details) and is a White Pyramid shot.\n\nTransporter  This is a VUK hidden from normal view.  It is the end of the\nleft lane, but Pyramid shots also lead to this VUK.  When\nTransporter is lit, it gives the currently active Transporter award\n(switched by the left Glider target).  There is a timer (like 15-20\nseconds) when the Guardian raises to add 10M(5M) to the Horus Value.\nWhen the Transporter is lit, it counts as a Segment.  Balls kicked\nout of the Transporter are supposed to follow the left ramp path down\nto the left flipper, but sometimes it goes astray and goes down the\nentrance of the left ramp screaming towards the right slingshot.\nThe Transporter is also the 3rd combo shot.  If the Transporter is\nlit and you start a mode, the Transporter will NOT be lit after the\nmode is over.  However, you can collect it during some modes.  It\nalso won't be lit if you drain.\n\nPyramid  The big gold thingy in the middle.  The shot to it is very\nnarrow, barely big enough for the ball to get through.  It is\npossible to hit this shot from ANY flipper, though it is most\ndifficult from the lower left flipper (and most dangerous).  If you\nflail at it with the upper flipper, it will go in more often than you\nmight think.  You start modes with this shot.  It is also a White\nPyramid shot and the 5th (final) shot of the combo.\n\nGlidercraft  This is the major toy of the game.  During Glidercraft mode and\nduring the 1st stage of Eye of Ra, the bottom portion of the Pyramid\n(the smooth gold part) will flip up and a Glidercraft will come out\nand simply start moving left and right.  It doesn't do anything,\nit's just there for decoration.  It's kind of cool, though.\n\nGlidercraft targets  These are 2 kicker-targets (i.e. you hit them and they\npush back at the ball) on either side of the entrance to the Pyramid.\nThe left one faces towards the upper flipper and the right one has a\npin in the middle of it.  Hitting the right target normally doesn't\nseem to do much of anything (except during Glidercraft mode), but\nhitting the pin straight on gives you some Bullseye award.  During\nnormal play, the left target changes the current Transporter award.\n\nRight Guardian  Same as the left Guardian except he guards the Trade Quartz\nshot.  Starts off a ball down, but shooting its standup target or\ngoing down the left inlane raises it.  Shooting the standup gives no\nadvantage over the left inlane.  The Guardian stays up until you\nshoot Trade Quartz, lose the ball, leave a Multiball, or get the 3x\nscoring award from the Transporter.  It is a White Pyramid shot.\n\nTrade Quartz  There is a VUK just behind the right Guardian.  During normal\nplay, shooting the VUK adds 1 Quartz to your total and enables you to\ntrade in your Quartz (see that section).  Trade Quartz is a Stargate\nSegment, the 4th combo shot, and probably also counts for the White\nPyramid of the right Guardian.  Balls kicked out of Trade Quartz\nfollow the right ramp's return path.\n\nRight ramp  Another pretty steep ramp with a sharp U-turn at its top.\nDuring normal play, the ramp spots a STARGATE letter.  The game\nbegins with like STAR already lit so you only need 4 shots to get the\nfirst award.  Spelling STARGATE gives you some award (see that\nsection) and counts as a Stargate Segment.  The right ramp is also a\nWhite Pyramid shot and the 2nd shot of the combo sequence.  Ball\nreturns to the bottom right flipper after intersecting with the\nSarcophagus habitrail.\n\nRight lane  This lane goes to the back of the machine into yet another VUK.\nOften it is blocked by an oversized drop target.  This is the shot\nyou need to make to get the Hurry-Up award.  It feeds to the\nSarcophagus via the skill shot habitrail.  The Hurry-Up award is lit\nby the pop bumpers and counts as a Stargate Segment.  The right lane\nis also a White Pyramid shot.\n\nUpper right flipper  Same as the bottom ones, except it's up here.  You can\nshoot the left ramp, either Glidercraft target (left is easier), the\nPyramid, the 2-bank, and the left outlane(!).  It's pretty hard to\nfeed this flipper directly from the bottom flippers other than by\nluck (unless the right lane drop target is up, in which case the ball\nwill easily fall down to the upper right flipper).  Sometimes\nSarcophagus kickouts get up this far.\n\nSkill shot ramp  Leads from the plunger up a small ramp.  The ball can\neither go too far and exit the top hole (which feeds the upper right\nflipper), just make it over the small step onto the Sarcophagus/skill\nshot habitrail and dribble down the right ramp return path, or have\nenough velocity to get past the right ramp return intersection and\nproceed on to the Sarcophagus.  The skill shot is to get it to the\nSarcophagus, where you'll be awarded 10M and the current Sarcophagus\naward.  If it does go down to the lower right flipper, you can shoot\nthe left lane instead for 10M and raise Horus bonus (but that's it).\n\nRa kicker target  This is located just above and to the right of the right\nslingshot, hittable by the left flipper.  Hitting it during normal\nplay lights it for Ra's Bracelet or something.  Basically, it scores\n5M, 10M, 20M, 20M...  It stays lit for around 5 seconds from the last\nhit.  Shooting this just after the left ramp when it is lit for\nDouble scores double amazingly enough (10M, 20M, but no higher) and\nis lit for points right away (for about 5 seconds).  This is also a\nWhite Pyramid shot.\n\nPlunger  A combo (manual/auto) plunger.  Licensed from Sega I believe.  ;)\n\nRight outlane  A pity Special can be lit here.  You have to claim it fairly\nquickly on your last ball if you're having an exceedingly bad game.\n\nRight inlane  Opens the left Guardian and lights the left lane (to the\nTransporter) for advancing the Horus bonus.\n\n\nGameplay\nSkill Shot\nStart off the ball by trying to plunge the ball into the Sarcophagus.  You\nneed to launch just hard enough to get the ball to travel past the right ramp\nreturn intersection and travel on to the Sarcophagus.  You also need to not\nplunge it too hard lest it go out the upper hole and to the upper flipper (in\nwhich case you'll get NOTHING).  If the ball goes down the right ramp return,\nthen catch the ball on the flipper and shoot the left lane (you'll also be\nawarded 10M and raise Horus bonus for this, but nothing else).  If the ball\ndoes go into the Sarcophagus, you'll be awarded 10M and a Sarcophagus shot.\nSarcophagus\nYou can earn a Sarcophagus award in one of two ways:  The first has already\nbeen discussed, i.e. making a skill shot.  The second involves the right drop\ntarget.  Shoot the right drop target when it is up to light the lane for a\nbrief amount of time (around 15-20 seconds I think).  If you shoot it during\nthis time, then you are awarded the Sarcophagus.  If you don't shoot it in\ntime, the drop target STAYS DOWN and shooting the right lane gives you\nbasically nothing (unless it was lit for something else).  The drop target\nwon't raise again until you shoot the right lane no matter how pointless that\nmay seem.\n\nThe Sarcophagus typically alternates between Multiball and award 3 Quartz, in\nthat order.  However, it seems that it can be set to also start a mode\nsometimes, though the conditions where this is awarded aren't entirely known.\nIt may just be every 3rd shot.\n\nThe Sarcophagus is one of the Stargate Segments.\nDrop Targets\nThere are 6 drop targets in the game:  The 3-bank on the lower left portion,\nthe 2-bank near the middle of the playfield, and the lone drop target that\nblocks the right lane.\n\nThe right drop target is controllable (retractable) by the game for when\nautolaunched balls and when certain awards are lit on the right lane.  It\ndoesn't really have anything else to do other than block the shot (well,\nshooting it lights \"double\" on the 2 bank I think as well).\n\nWhen all 5 of the regular drop targets are up, the leftmost target on the 3-\nbank will be flashing (for 5M).  Shooting this target before shooting any of\nthe other 5 scores 5M and lights the next one for 10M.  Likewise, shooting\nthe 10M target before any of the remaining 3 scores 10M and lights the 3rd\nfor 20M.  And so on, for 40M on the lower of the 2-bank targets and 80M for\nthe topmost 2-bank target.\n\nAfter the 5M shot, the values will time out after some time.  The higher the\nvalue, the faster the shot will expire.  It's quite long for the 10M, pretty\nlong for the 20M, but for 40M it's about 4 or 5 seconds, and then 1 or 2\nseconds for the 80M shot.  The best way to get the 80M is probably to sweep\nthe 2-bank.  Completing the sequence, then, is worth 155M.  Hitting any of\nthe 5 targets out-of-order aborts the drop target millions sequence until all\n5 of them are standing again.  This is (obviously) lit at the start of the\nball, then.\n\nIf only the middle target on the 3-bank remains standing, it will be lit for\n1 Quartz.  (The 2-bank targets do not affect this award.)\n\nSweeping either bank (that is, hitting all targets in a bank at once) scores\nRa's Power.  It starts at 5M for each ball and goes up each time.  I'm not\nreally sure yet how it goes up, though...  Either it's 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. or\n5, 10, 20, 30 or 5, 10, 20, 40.  Shooting the right drop target seems to\nlight the 2-bank for \"Double\" which probably awards double the next Ra's\nPower value.  Maybe it even doubles the drop target millions values?...\nGenerally, the only way you'll be able to sweep the 3 bank is by a lucky\nkickback (due to the fact they're facing right at your flipper).\nHurry-Up\nHurry-Up is activated normally by getting 10 pop bumper hits.  It is also\nactivated by getting 10 combos.  When lit, shoot the right lane within 10-15\nseconds to collect the Hurry-Up award.  The awards are:\n\n\n 10M\n 30M\n extra ball\n 50M\n + ??\n\n\nThe value is held for the whole game (i.e. you don't need to make all 3\nHurry-Ups on one ball to get the extra ball), though that's probably\nadjustable.\n\nCollecting the Hurry-Up award is one of the Stargate Segments.\nCombos\nThe left ramp is almost always lit to start the combo sequence.  There are 5\nshots in the combo sequence and they are always the same and in the same\norder.  They are:\n\n\n (5M) left ramp (yes, starting it counts as a combo)\n (10M and/or Segment) right ramp\n (20M) left lane\n (30M) Trade Quartz shot\n (?M and advance SJ) Pyramid\n\n\nAfter getting a total of 10 combos, Hurry-Up is activated (see that section).\nThe next award is after a total of 30 combos, and that is flash extra ball.\nAfter that, not sure.\n\nThe combo shots don't time out (or if they do, it takes a long long time).\nHowever, the first switch that you touch that is wrong ends the sequence.\nThis excludes the right inlane, but not anything else, including a pop bumper\non the way up the left lane, or the left lane misfiring (ball doesn't get out\nof the VUK).  You can even start the combo sequence in a multiball (depends\nif anything can be lit on the left ramp or not), but the \"hit any wrong\nswitch\" rule still applies, so it's not very likely you'll get very far.\n\nHe who gets the most combos in a game gets to put their initials on the high\nscore board.  However, this is quite flaky, as I've often gotten above the\nhigh # of combos and not been awarded anything.\n\nMaking the 2nd combo shot (the right ramp) awards the Combo Stargate Segment.\nWhite Pyramids\nThere are several shots scattered around the playfield that have white\npyramid lights in front of them.  They are:\n\n\n Left guardian\n Left ramp\n Pyramid\n Right guardian\n Right ramp\n Right lane\n RA kicker target\n\n\nThey do not seem to be lit in any particular order, but only one is lit at a\ntime.  Making one turns its light solid and lights another one.  Completing\nall 7 gives you some award:  So far all I know of is 5 Quartz and 30M for the\nfirst 2.  I think it may just alternate between those 2 awards.  Shooting one\nthat is flashing or already lit may tell you what the next award is.\n\nCompleting the Pyramids awards the Pyramid Stargate Segment.\nSTARGATE\nShooting the right ramp just about any time will spot a letter in STARGATE.\nThere is no indication as to your progress except when you see the animation\nwhen you shoot the ramp.  (It may be in the status report though, which as of\nthis game, really starts to give you interesting information instead of just\nthe replay and highest score that other Gottlieb games gave.)  The game\nstarts out with a bunch of letters already spotted, 4 of them I think.  Each\ncompletion of STARGATE gives you an award, always in this order:\n\n\n 3 Quartz\n Advance SJ\n 5 Quartz\n + not sure\n\n\nCompleting STARGATE the first time awards the Spell Stargate Segment.\nTransporter\nThe transporter is lit simply by hitting the left guardian when it is in the\nlowered position.  It also seems to be lit after making the 3rd combo shot\n(left lane), but I'm not positive about that.\n\nThe first 4 awards are always the same POSSIBLE 4 awards, but the order that\nyou get them in is switched by hitting the left Glidercraft target.  You can\nsee the next award in the status report and after you hit the left\nGlidercraft.  The first 4 awards are (in this order):\n\n\n 5 Quartz\n Extra Ball\n Advance SJ\n 3x Scoring for 30 Seconds\n\n\nThe first 3 are fairly obvious; the last award (3x scoring) probably is as\nwell, but I'll point out that it multiplies every possible point scored,\nincluding super jackpots!  AND, on top of that, there is a bug (I assume it\nis a bug, I can't imagine the rules actually being designed this way) that\nduring regular Multiball, Stargate Multiball, and Eye of Ra Multiball the\ntimer STOPS, giving you 3x scoring for the entire multiball!  Sheesh!\nSandstorm may stop it as well, but I haven't found out yet for sure.\n\nThe 5th Transporter award is Sandstorm.  See that section for details.\n\nAfter 5 awards, the pool is reset.  The next Sandstorm is 11 Transporters\naway, and the pool grows accordingly (i.e. 11 possible awards). Some of the\nawards in the 2nd pool include:\n\n\n 3 Quartz\n 5 Quartz\n 10M\n 20M\n 30M\n Multiball\n 3x Scoring for 30 Seconds\n Hurry-Up\n\n\nI'm not positive about any others.  Advance SJ may be one of them; I'm pretty\nsure Extra Ball is not.\n\nAfter making an award, the game will usually tell you the next one (until it\ngets switched by the Glidercraft) as well as how many Transporters until the\nnext Sandstorm.\n\nMaking the Transporter the first time awards the Transporter Stargate\nSegment.\nSuper Jackpot\nThe Super Jackpot starts the game at 100M (50M for reduced scoring) and can\nbe increased in a variety of ways:\n\n\n Transporter award\n Quartz award (double advance)\n Spell STARGATE\n Completing combo sequence\n\n\nThe amount it goes up is the same as the starting value, except, obviously,\nfor the double advance (goes up 200M or 100M).\n\nThe value is held for the whole game.  It just keeps getting bigger and\nbigger.\n\nYou can get the Super Jackpot in regular Multiball, Stargate Multiball, Eye\nof Ra Multiball, and as a Quartz award.  See those various sections for\ndetails.\nQuartz\nQuartz are gained throughout the game and are used to trade in for various\nawards via the Trade Quartz shot.  The Trade Quartz shot is located behind\nthe right guardian and is opened by going down the left inlane or shooting\nthe guardian's standup target.\n\nYou can gain Quartz by:\n\n\n Every other Sarcophagus shot\n 3-bank middle target (see drop target section)\n Transporter awards\n White pyramid awards\n Spelling STARGATE awards\n Quartz mode\n\n\nAlso, shooting Trade Quartz gives you one more Quartz.\n\nWhen you shoot Trade Quartz, you are given a choice that you can either\naccept or decline by hitting the right or left flipper, respectively.  The\nintervals are not exactly known, but I will get as close as I can and the\nlist will get more exact over time.  Entries with an exclamation (!) are\nknown for certain.\n\n\nQuartz  Offered \n1!-3!    10M (5M reduced scoring) \n4!-6!    50M (25M reduced scoring)   \n7!-9!    Flash (light) extra ball - 100M after choosing this once. \n10!-15!  Double advance SJ  \n16!-19!  Sandstorm    \n20!-25   Complete all Segments (or Super Jackpot if you've already had Stargate Multiball) \n26+      Super Jackpot   \n\n\nI'm not sure if there's anything after Super Jackpot; I tend to doubt it.  I\nhave seen up to 48 Quartz, and it was Super Jackpot that was offered.\n\nWhen you trade in your Quartz for an award, you trade them all and must work\nyour way back up from 0 again.  So, at this point, my suggestion is as soon\nas you hit Super Jackpot, you might as well take it because you won't gain\nanything for holding on to those Quartz (well, your bonus will be a little\nhigher, but that's not worth very much).  Aborting this animation assumes an\nanswer of yes to trading.\n\nShooting Trade Quartz the first time lights its Stargate Segment.\nMultiball\nRegular Multiball is started by every odd-numbered shot (including skill\nshots) to the Sarcophagus.  It starts out as a 2-ball multiball, but getting\njust one Jackpot launches a third ball into play.\n\nThere are 2 \"levels\" of Multiball.  You always start regular Multiball at\nLevel 1, which has 3 Jackpots lit (2 on harder settings, e.g. 5-ball).  The\nJackpots are lit in this order:\n\n\n Left ramp\n Left lane\n Ra kicker target\n Right lane\n Right ramp\n Trade Quartz\n\n\nJackpots are worth 10M.  Making either Jackpot lights the next one down the\nlist.  After 5 are made, there will only be one lit.  Completing all 6 lights\nthe Pyramid for the Super Jackpot.  If you get the SJ, you go to Level 2.\nNow only 1 Jackpot is lit at a time (regardless of the difficulty), and in a\ndifferent order.  I'm not sure exactly what the order is, but it starts like:\n\n\n Ra kicker target\n Left lane\n ...  (I've gotten further, I just can't remember what the order was)\n\n\nYou still need to make 6 Jackpots (still worth 10M).  However, getting all 6\nlights the Pyramid for a double Super Jackpot.  Making this starts Level 2\nagain.\nSandstorm\nThis is a 3-ball multiball where every major shot (guardians, ramps, Pyramid,\nright lane, Ra kicker) is lit for 10M (or 5M in reduced scoring).  This\ndiffers from other Gottlieb games that have awards of this nature in that\nit's not just every switch that scores, but only \"shots,\" and as such isn't\nworth nearly the points as other similar awards are (e.g. Slammin' Jammin' on\nShaq Attaq).\n\nIt seems that some shots will unlight (specifically, the right ramp and the\nPyramid) during Sandstorm, perhaps to prevent a exploit of some kind.  It's a\nlittle difficult to exploit Sandstorm, though, because both of the Guardians are\ndown.  Why they exploit-proofed this mode and not others is beyond me.\n\nThere may be a ball saver, but if there is, it's very short.  The mode ends\nwhen there are less than 2 balls left, and you aren't awarded the points\nuntil the end of the ball (so don't tilt!).\nStargate Multiball (wizard award)\nThe circle on the playfield closest to you has 7 different features on it\n(\"Segments\").  The 7 Segments are:\n\n\n Sarcophagus\n Trade Quartz\n Transporter\n Spell STARGATE\n Hurry-Up\n Combo\n Pyramid\n\n\nYou know you are awarded a Segment when you see a Wheel-of-Fortune-like\nanimation (Wheel-of-Segments?).  Each Segment is described in its own section\nabove.  When you complete all 7, you start Stargate Multiball.  (If you're in\nanother Multiball or a mode, though, Stargate Multiball won't start until it\nis over.)\n\n[Movie spoiler alert]\n\nFor some reason, the opening animation has nothing to do with the Stargate.\nThe scene from the movie that the animation is taken from is actually Ra's\nship being blown up at the end of the movie.  Oooooookaaaaay...\n\n[End movie spoiler alert]\n\nStargate Multiball is a 3-ball multiball, and all 7 major shots are lit for\nJackpots (of 20M) at once.  They are:\n\n\n Left lane\n Left ramp\n Pyramid\n Trade Quartz\n Right ramp\n Right lane\n Ra kicker target\n\n\nSimply make all 7, and you get the Super Jackpot (the 7th shot awards the\nJackpot THEN the Super Jackpot...  weird).  Then all 7 shots relight\nagain, and you repeat the process.  Just keep plugging away until you have\nless than 2 balls left in play.\n\nYou do have a short ballsaver, though the game doesn't indicate that anyhow.\nThe thing is this:  You can only get Stargate Multiball once per game.  If\nyou blow it early, then that's it.  No more chances.\n\nAt the end of the game, you get a Segment Bonus of 10M per Segment.  (It\ngives it to you before you are asked if you want to continue which is a\nslight departure from their earlier games.)  If you tilt Ball 3 (or Ball 5 or\nwhatever your last ball is), then you do NOT get the bonus!\nModes\nThere are 6 modes in Stargate, several of which are multiball modes.\nMultiball modes run until less than 2 balls remain; the rest of the modes are\njust timed.\n\nFor any multiball mode, you start with 2 balls.  Hitting any of the pertinent\ntargets launches a third ball into play (once).  There is no ball saver.\n\nIf you're not in a mode or Multiball, then shooting the Pyramid will start\nthe currently flashing mode (usually - seems there are problems after going\nthrough the modes once entirely).  The mode lit at the start of the game is\nrandom, and the lit mode is changed by the slingshots.\n\nIn no particular order:\nSave Sari\nThe right drop target lowers and you must shoot the right lane for a\ncountdown value.  It starts at 30M and rapidly goes down to 10M.  Shooting\nthe right lane awards the value, and resets the value to 50M.  To collect the\nnext value, though, you have to BOTH shoot the drop target then the right\nlane.  Keep in mind the ball is coming out of the Sarcophagus at this point,\nso you don't even have control of the ball!  If by some minor miracle you\nmake the second value, it just goes back to 50M and you hit both the drop\ntarget and the right lane again.  Yay.\n\nThe mode ends when the value gets to 10M.  The best thing you can do during\nthis mode is ignore it (hold the ball and wait), maybe shoot the right ramp\nfor a STARGATE letter.\nQuartz (Multiball mode)\nBoth ramps are lit (strobing).  Hitting either one adds 1 Quartz to your\ntotal.  That's pretty much it!\n\nHit either ramp to launch the third ball.  The mode ends when less than 2\nballs are left.\nBattle\nBoth guardians are raised and the shots they protect are lit to collect the\nHorus bonus.  The Horus bonus starts at 10M at the beginning of the game and\ncan be raised 10M by shooting the Transporter shortly after raising the left\nguardian (by either the right inlane or shooting the guardian's stand-up\ntarget).  Each successful shot during Battle also raises the Horus bonus by\n10M.\n\nThis mode can be worth a ton of points, as the shots feed to each other.\nCombined with the Catch-All flippers, all you need to do is make a shot, hold\nthe flipper up to catch the returning ball, and make an easy shot at the next\ntarget.  This can go on for a lot more than the initial allotment of 20\nseconds, as each shot adds 3 seconds to the timer (never higher than 25\nseconds, though).\n\nIn reduced scoring mode, the Horus bonus is worth 1/2 the regular scoring\nvalue.  Battle ends as soon as the timer hits 0 (no grace period).\nRebellion (Multiball mode)\nDuring this mode, the pop bumpers score 5M each.  Just keep sending balls up\nthere and watch the score soar!\n\nTo get the third ball, you need to hit the left guardian's standup.\nRebellion ends when less than 2 balls remain.\nRa's Temple (Multiball mode)\nIn this mode, the Ra kicker target will start flashing.  You need to hit it\ntwice, and each time you do, you get another ball (yes, you can have 4 balls\nduring this mode).  Then the Pyramid will be lit for unlimited 50M shots.\n\nThis mode can be quite lucrative if you have the Pyramid shot down.  It ends\nwhen less than 2 balls remain in play.\nGlidercraft (Multiball mode)\nThe ultimate flail around mode!  :)  The Glidercraft targets are lit for 5M\nand eventually go up to 10M.  In regular scoring, they can also go up to 20M.\nJust keep wailing away on them (most of these modes ARE pretty easy, huh?).\n\nThe first Glidercraft hit launches the third ball.  The mode ends when less\nthan 2 balls are left in play.\nEye of Ra (wizard award)\nAfter you have played all 6 modes, the eye in the middle of the mode \"circle\"\nwill start flashing.  Shoot the Pyramid to start Eye of Ra multiball.\n\nThis is a 3 stage 4-ball multiball.  There is a very short ball saver at the\nstart of the mode.  There are certain tasks you must do to finish each stage.\nCompleting a stage awards the Super Jackpot.  After the first 2 stages, any\ndrained balls are replenished (no ball saver).  The 3 stages are:\n\n\n Hit 5 (6 for hard rules) Glidercraft.  The game tells you how many you\nhave left for the SJ.\n\n Shoot the left lane and the Trade Quartz shot.  Sounds easy, but the\ncatch here is that the guardians raise and lower at their own volition.\nThey'll be up for about 3-4 seconds then down for 3-4 seconds.  Best\nthing to do here is hold a ball on each flipper then when the guardians\nraise, shoot one of them (don't try for both at once), let them come back\ndown and back up, then shoot the other one.  The first one shot is worth\n20M.\n\n Shoot the Pyramid 3 (4 for hard rules) times.  Not sure how much each\nshot is worth, but the game tells you how many shots you have left.\n\n\nIf you make it through all 3 stages and still have more than one ball in\nplay, then you enter normal Multiball at Level 2 (no new balls are launched,\nthough).\n\nEye of Ra will end any time you wind up with less than 2 balls in play.\n\nAfter Eye of Ra is over, all the mode lights go off and you start over.  At\nthis point, the slingshots toggle whether the Pyramid is lit for a mode or\nnot!  Nothing like a little randomness for a very major part of gameplay...\nStrategies and Tricks\nStargate has a switch-test mode available to the normal player!  To activate\nit, hold down the start button (with no credits, obviously) and tap the right\nflipper button.  The game will cycle through all of what it believes are bad\nswitches (if there are any at all).\n\nThere are about 27 screens of tips basically explaining to you in a pinch\nwhat lights or awards what.  They are even mostly right.  ;)  Hold down the\nleft flipper to bring up the first screen then page through them with the\nright flipper button.\n\nAlways go for the Sarcophagus skill shot.  Multiball can be worth quite a bit\nif your SJ is high (not so much if you don't make it, though).  Possible\nexceptions to this rule are:  the Sarcophagus kickout really blows on your\nmachine or you really need to make the combo shot (like it's the last thing\nneeded for Stargate Multiball).\n\nWhen a ball is going to be autoplunged, consider launching it yourself.  You\ncan often put more force on the ball than can the autoplunger, and most\nmultiballs require a shot at the left ramp fairly early on, so give yourself\na guaranteed shot at it (autoplunger will often not get it all the way to the\nupper hole).\n\nRemember:  This is a Gottlieb game!  Catches are easy, and on most\nmachines, you can just hold the flipper up when the ball is coming down from\na ramp return and usually the ball will not have enough uumph to clear the\nflipper, and you catch it.\n\nYou should spend quite a bit of time at the start of your game just\nincreasing the Super Jackpot.  You can do it by 12 right ramps, the\nTransporter, and most importantly, the Trade Quartz double-advance.  It is\nparamount that you have a high SJ for Eye of Ra and Stargate Multiball, or\nthey'll mostly be wasted.  A good value would be 500M (250M reduced scoring).\n\nIf you want to use the 3x scoring bug (or exploit), then avoid that Transporter\naward like the plague until you are absolutely ready to start Stargate or Eye\nof Ra or both.  If you do accidently get 3x at the wrong time, then you can\ntry to make the best of it by starting a decent mode (Battle can score\nridiculously high with 3x, as well as Glidercraft and Rebellion).  Another\npossibility is to shoot the Transporter like mad until 3x comes around again.\n\nThere's also a couple mode exploits you should know about:\n\n\n Well, Battle is a exploit unto itself.  Don't miss, and you'll end up in the\n100M (50M reduced) range easy.  It really helps to bump up the value a bit\nduring regular play as well.\n During Quartz, the best thing to do with 2 balls is get one on each\nflipper.  Shoot the right ramp with the ball on the left flipper.  If\nyou're successful, then shoot the left lane with the ball on the right\nflipper.  The ball from the ramp will then return to your right flipper\n(just hold the flipper up and you'll catch it), and the left lane ball will\ngo into the Transporter and be returned to your left flipper.  Repeat\nforever.\n Similar exploit during Ra's Temple:  After hitting the kicker a couple of\ntimes, try to get one ball on the left flipper and the rest on the right.\nThe best thing to do would be just to loop the Pyramid by shooting it over\nand over with the left flipper (as the ball returns to the left flipper).\nOf course, it's a lot easier from the right, so employ a strategy similar\nto Quartz:  With 2 balls, one on each flipper, shoot the Pyramid with the\nright flipper.  Shoot the right ramp with the left flipper, catch both\nballs, repeat.\n During Rebellion, the pop bumper area is a pretty easy shot from the left\nflipper.  So hold a ball (or 2) on the right flipper, shoot the pop bumpers\nwith the left flipper, and hopefully the ball will come back to the left\nflipper either via the extra ball rollover or off the right slingshot or\nball(s) held on the right flipper.\n\n\nSaving Sari serves 100% no useful purpose.  Ignore it completely.\n\nFor Multiball, learn how the jackpots light up.  That way you can already be\nshooting the next shot while the previous one is registering.\n\nDuring any multiball, never be afraid to put a ball out of the way for a\nshort time, especially if you need to shoot the right lane.  If you have a\nball on each flipper, shoot the left lane with the right flipper, then you\ncan have a clear shot at the right lane for whatever's lit there.  Another\ngood place to get the ball out of the way is the Pyramid.\n\nDon't forget, also, that the right flipper button is a 2-stage flipper.  If\nyou are very careful, you can lower the upper right flipper while keeping the\nlower one up.  This is very handy when you have a jackpot shot lit on the\nright lane (which the upper left flipper blocks) and a ball (or more) on each\nflipper.\n\nYou should probably generally ignore the Ra kicker target.  It's not worth\nit.  Also, ignore the drop target millions unless you have the 20M target\nlit.  Then, try to shoot it and sweep the 40M and 80M targets for another\n120M.\n\nThe White Pyramid shots generally aren't worth going out of your way for\nunless you need to finish them for Stargate Multiball.\n\nNEVER choose Sandstorm from Trade Quartz.  Just a few more Quartz and you can\nhave Stargate Multiball or Super Jackpot, either of which is 99% guaranteed\nto be worth more than Sandstorm.  It may not be a bad idea to go for\nSandstorm from the Transporter, but don't sacrifice your 3x scoring for it.\nThanks\nThanks to the following people for providing information...\n\n\n Dave Stewart\n Steve Jonke\n Bowen Kerins\n Michael Field\n John Gantert\n The rest of the FSPA\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Stargate", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb (Premier)", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/stargate.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Stargate", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Playfield Description\nIn the most clockwise order I could come up with:\n\n\nLeft flipperStandard flipper here.\n\nLeft inlaneLights the right loop for an Orbit Multiball\nletter.\n\nArm Nukes holeA small hole just above the left inlane.  Can be lit for EB\nand Planet Multiball.  The ball is kicked out from the hole to\nthe right flipper.\n\nBug standupsAbove the Arm Nukes hole, are four standups, standing side to side.\nTwo yellow targets, one red and one green.  The colors correspond\nto a particular bug species (see 4. Main Objective).  Hit a flashing\nstandup and kill a bug - simple as that.\n\nLeft loopA loop, going all around the back of the playfield, ending up at the\nentrance to the Right loop.  The loop can be either unlit, in which\ncase the ball will be sent to bonus X rollovers, or lit for an Orbit\nMultiball letter.\n\nLeft ramp, \"STARSHIP\"Shooting the ramp lights STARSHIP (see 8. Recon Awards).  Lit for\njackpots during regular Multiball.  A yellow Bug standup is to the\nleft of the ramp entrance.  Slow shots drop into the Orbit Multiball\nlock (see below), really slow shots have a nasty tendency of going\nSDTM.\n\nThe WarriorThis is sort of a mobile standup target.  It can move back and forth\n(slowly).  Shooting it a number of times (see 6. Regular Multiball)\nwill light Multiball.  As you shoot it, it moves backwards, finally\nrevealing a sinkhole - this is where Multiball is started and\nSuper Jackpots collected.\n\nOrbit Multiball lockBehind the Warrior is a small sinkhole.  A magnet can stop balls\ncoming from the left or right loop and drop the ball into the\nsinkhole for an Orbit Multiball lock.\n\nBug standups IIMore standups;  Two green, two blue.  Some of them can be hit by\nrandom bumper action.  The standups flank the exit from the bumper\narea.\n\nBumpersThree bumpers, arranged the usual way.  Balls can exit through\na passage to the right of the left ramp.\n\nB-U-G rolloversLocated just above the bumpers.  Spell B-U-G to advance bonus X by\none.  Just above the 'U' is another magnet that can stop a ball\ncoming from either loop and drop it to the rollovers.  This is\nwhat happens when you shoot an unlit loop.\n\nRecon Award scoopA small scoop, just below the bumper area.  See 8. Recon Awards for\nthe details.  Balls coming from the Orbit MB lock and the Warrior\nsinkhole are kicked out here as well.\n\nRight ramp, \"TROOPERS\"Shooting the ramp lights TROOPERS (see 8. Recon Awards).  Lit for\njackpots during regular Multiball.  A yellow Bug standup is to the\nright of the ramp entrance.  Slow shots drop into the bumper area.\n\nBrain bugA target hidden underneath the playfield, which can pop up for you\nto shoot at.  And it's a huge target!  Located infront of the\nRight ramp/Recon scoop.\n\nRight loopSame as the left loop.\n\nBug standups IIIEven more standups;  two yellow, one green and one red.  These\nare just above the right slingshot.\n\nRight inlaneLights the left loop for an Orbit Multiball letter.\n\nRight outlaneThis one is a bit different;  it's actually a combined\noutlane / shooter lane.  A one-way gate above the combo-plunger\nsees to that drained balls leave the playfield peacefully.\n\nRight mini-flipperMounted to the right of, and slightly above, the standard-sized\nright flipper is a small Thing-sized flipper.  The flipper is\ncontrolled with a separate button mounted below the normal\nflipper button.  Trust me, this is confusing at first!\n\nRight flipperStandard flipper.\n\nStatus displaysJust above the flippers are four single-digit displays.  These tell\nyou how many bugs are left on the planet currently under attack.\nThe displays are:  Warriors (yellow), Plasma Bugs (blue),\nHoppers (green), Tankers (red).\n\nPlanet statusAbove the Status displays are the six planets o' bugs portrayed;\nAntilles, Zegema Beach, Dantana, Tango Urilla, Planet P, and finally\nthe ultimate bug planet from hell, Klendathu.  These can be\nunlit (not attacked), flashing (have been attacked) or solid\n(have been nuked as well).\n\n3.  Skill shots\nThere are three possible skill shots:\n\n\n Plunge the ball;  a magnet will catch the ball above the B-U-G\nrollovers.  One of the rollover lights will be flashing;  move it\nwith the flipper buttons.  If you do it right, you're awarded\n+1 Bonus X.  (This is very similar to the skillshot in Medieval\nMadness)\n\n Hold the left flipper button as you plunge the ball;  hitting\nthe right ramp will award a 5M Ramp Skillshot.  Holding the\nleft button will disable the magnet that otherwise would've\ncaptured the ball.\n\n Hold the left flipper button as you plunge the ball;  plunge just\nhard enough to get the ball into the Orbit Multiball sinkhole.\nYou will be awarded an Orbit MB letter.  This probably isn't an\n\"official\" skillshot though.\n\n4.  Main Objective\nSix planets full of bugs, and you must kill 'em all.  You attack the\nplanets one at a time in a fixed order.  There are four potential\nspecies to be annihilated;  Warriors, Plasma Bugs, Hoppers and\nTankers.  The type of bugs and their numbers differ from planet to\nplanet.  To kill a bug, you simply shoot any flashing Bug standup.\nEach bug is associated with a color:\n\n\n Warrior    Yellow \n Hopper     Green  \n Plasma Bug Blue   \n Tanker     Red    \n\n\nSo, to kill a Hopper, you shoot for the flashing GREEN standup of your\nchoice.  Note that bugs can be killed only during regular play!\n4.1  The Planets\nWhen the game starts, Antilles is under attack.  To get to the next planet,\nyou must first eliminate all bugs.  At first, plenty of Bug standups will\nbe lit.  However, as you kill more and more bugs the number of lit\nstandups will decrease.\n\nThe planets and their inhabitants, in order of appearance:\n\n\n Planet Warriors Hoppers Plasma Tankers \n Antilles 5 3 0 0 \n Zegema Beach 4 7 0 0 \n Dantana 6 5 3 0 \n Tango Urilla 8 6 0 5 \n Planet P 9 0 5 7 \n Klendathu(see 11.1 Klendathu) \n\n4.2  Point values for Bugs\nThe point values for the different bugs increase as you move on to new\nplanets.  For example, a Warrior on Antilles is worth 100K, whereas a\nWarrior on Zegema Beach is worth 150K.  Point values for Bugs on\neach planet:\n\n\nPlanetWarriorsHoppersPlasmaTankers\nAntilles 100K 200K N/A N/A \nZegema Beach 150K 250K N/A N/A \nDantana 200K 300K 400K N/A \nTango Urilla 250K 350K N/A 500K \nPlanet P 300K 400K 500K 550K \nKlendathu (see 11.1 Klendathu)\n\n4.3  Mini-flipper scoring\nIf you shoot a Bug standup with the mini-flipper, that hit will count\nas two hits.  Get good at shooting bugs with the mini-flipper;  you\nwill advance through planets much quicker if you do!  It is possible\nto cheat the machine by flipping the mini-flipper after you've made\na shot with one of the two regular flippers.\n4.4  The Brain bug\nOnce all bugs on a planet have been whacked, you may try to capture\nthe Brain bug.  The Brain bug is represented by a huge standup target\nthat pops up infront of the Recon Award scoop.  To capture it, you must\nhit it a number of times (it's hard to miss).  The first time you need\none hit, the second time two hits, etc.  Each hit is worth 1M.  This is\na timed mode (though I can't remember a timer being displayed);  if you\nrun out of time, the Brain bug escapes.  I usually trap the ball and\nwait for the Brain bug to disappear;  the risk you take shooting at it\nisn't worth a couple of millions.\n4.5  Advance Planet vs. Planet Multiball\nOnce the Brain bug is gone (doesn't matter if you captured it or let\nit escape), the Arm Nukes hole will be lit for Planet Multiball, and\nthe Recon scoop will be lit for Advance Planet.  They will remain\nlit until either shot has been made.  A hurry-up, starting at 5M and\ncounting down to 1M, is started at the same time;  shoot the Recon\nscoop or the Arm Nukes hole to collect.\n\nYou should try to advance to the next planet, unless you're already\non the fifth planet (Planet P), in which case that option is\nunavailable.  If you collect Advance Planet, you will return to\nregular play with a whole bunch of new Bugs to whack.\n5.  Planet Multiball\nPlanet Multiball is an N-ball Multiball, where N is determined by the\nnumber of planets being nuked.  All flashing planets fall victim of\nthe nuke attack.  The more planets you nuke simultaneously, the higher\nthe point values during Planet Multiball, and the more balls you get.\nThe idea is to advance to as many planets as possible before starting\nPlanet MB.\n\nThe following shots will be lit at the start of Planet Multiball:\n\nLeft loop, Left ramp, Recon scoop, Right ramp, Right loop,\nArm Nukes hole.\n\nYou must make the first five Nuke shots to light Super Nuke at the Warrior.\nThe Recon scoop awards a Double Nuke.  The Arm Nukes hole will spot a\nNuke for you and award the associated jackpot.  Each shot has a\nflashing arrow or lamp labeled \"Nuke\" that will turn solid once hit.\n\nThe point values depending on the number of planets being nuked:\n\n\n# planetsNuke JackpotSuper NukeNumber of balls\n 1    1M       10M      2  \n 2    2.5M     25M      2  \n 3    4M       40M      3  \n 4    7M       70M      4  \n 5    12M      120M     4  \n\n\nOnce the Super Nuke has been collected, all Nuke shots are relit for\nanother go.  This multiball can be worth a lot!  After Planet MB is\nover, all nuked planets will be lit solid.\n6.  Regular Multiball\n(I believe it's actually called Live Fire Assault Range MB.)\n\nShooting the Warrior a number of times will start Multiball.  The first\nMultiball it takes 4 hits, second MB 6 hits, etc.  As you shoot the\nWarrior target, it will move backwards.  When only one shot is left\nto light MB, the Warrior will move back and forth to indicate this.\n\nThe Multiball itself is a 4-ball MB.  Both ramps are lit for jackpots;\nthe jackpot value starts at 3M and can be increased to a maximum of 4M.\nYou increase the jackpot value by hitting the Bug standups.  All\nstandups will be unlit at the start of MB;  if you hit a standup, it\nwill light up, and will not add points to the jackpot value anymore.\nLighting all standups awards an Extra Ball (which I haven't been able\nto confirm, since one of the standups is broken on the machine I'm\nplaying).\n\nYou need five jackpots to light the Super Jackpot, which is worth\na whopping 15M.  The Warrior will at all times spot a jackpot for you,\nbut will not award the associated point value.  The Super Jackpot\nremains lit for 16 seconds.  Once the Super Jackpot has been collected,\nor the timer has reached zero, the cycle repeats.\n\nIf you fail to shoot any jackpots at all, a Multiball restart sequence\nwill commence.  You have some 15-20 seconds to get the ball into the\nWarrior sinkhole.  You only get two balls in the restarted MB.\n7.  Orbit Multiball\nTo start Orbit Multiball, you must make two Orbit locks.  To lock\nthe first ball, you need to shoot three lit loops (the DMD will\ndisplay the word ONE, with the collected letter flashing).  The inlane\nswitches light the opposite loop, for a period of around 5 seconds.\nThe third loop shot will be caught by a magnet, and dropped into the\nOrbit MB sinkhole.  The same applies for lock number two, with the only\ndifference the word to spell is TWO.  So, all in all, it takes six loop\nshots to start Orbit MB.  This number does not increase.  Note that\nmaking a lit loop shot does not unlight that loop, so it's fully\npossible to make 3 loops shots in a row for an Orbit MB lock!\n\nOrbit Multiball starts out as a two-ball Multiball.  Both loops are lit\nfor a 5M jackpot, and remain lit throughout Orbit MB.  A successful loop\nshot will be caught by the magnet, dropped into the sinkhole and then\nkicked out from the Recon scoop.  The first two loop shots will add a\nball as well, even if the shot is made after the ballsaver has\nexpired.  Thus, a maximum of four balls can be in play.\n8.  Recon Awards\nA Recon Award is a pseudo-random award collected in the Recon scoop.\nBy shooting the left (STARSHIP) and right (TROOPERS) ramp you go to\nthe next Recon Level.  There are six Recon Levels (1-6).  The higher\nyou go before collecting at the scoop, the better the awards.  The\nDMD will display four choices, and one of them will \"randomly\" be\npicked for you.  The scoop is lit for a Recon Level 1 award at the\nstart of each ball.\n\nThe following awards are those I know of:\n\n\nLevelAwards\n 1 Ground Attack, Psychic Test, Spot Species, Bonus Hold, Recon Bounty 1M \n 2 Ground Attack, Orbits lit, Super Pops, Recon Bounty 2M \n 3 Double Scoring, Spot Planet, Multiball Ready, Recon Bounty 5M \n 4 Ramp Hurry-up, Air Attack, Recon Bounty 8M, Nuke Chase \n 5 Multiball, Multiball Ready, Orbit Multiball, Extra Ball \n 6 Extra Ball, Special, 25M points \n\n\nThe awards have been known to move up or down a level.  The major awards\n(such as Orbit MB, Double Scoring, Ramp Hurry-up) seem to not move, though.\n\nIt is my experience that level 5 will always award Regular MB if you\nhaven't had one already, otherwise Orbit MB.  Level 6 will award 25M.\nNote that Regular MB and Orbit MB usually are worth much more than 25M.\n8.1  Recon Boost & Combos\nYou'll sometimes be awarded a Recon Boost when you shoot the Recon scoop\n(only when it's lit for a Recon Award).  This seems to be random, and can\nbe very annoying if you're fishing after that lucrative Orbit MB and get\n25M instead.  You can be boosted any number of levels, I think.\n\nA more controlled way of boosting the Recon Level is to do a Recon\nCombo.  I'm not 100% sure how this works just yet;  if you shoot the\nRight ramp, Left ramp, Recon scoop you boost three additional levels.\nOr so I like to think, anyway.        Could use some help here\n8.2  List o' Recon awards\nThe awards described briefly:\n\n\nGround Attack\n    A two-ball multiball.  The DMD will cycle through 100K, 200K,\n300K, 400K *rapidly*.  Hitting any Bug standup target will award\nthe displayed value.\n\nPsychic Test\n    The video mode.  You get to cycle through a deck of cards with the\nleft flipper button.  Select with the right button.  If your card\nmatches the one picked by the game you're awarded a Special.  There\nare also point awards for matching color, number, etc.\n\nSpot Species\n    Kills all bugs of the species in majority.\n\nBonus Hold\n    Holds the bonus multiplier, I would assume.  I've never gotten it.\n\nRecon Bounty\n    Point award.\n\nOrbits Lit\n    Both loops will be lit for an Orbit MB letter, for the remainder of\nthe ball in play.\n\nSuper Pops\n    Bumpers worth 50K / hit.\n\nDouble Scoring\n    All points values are doubled.  Lasts 20 seconds.\n\nSpot Planet\n    Kills all bugs on the planet currently under attack.\n\nMultiball Ready\n    Lights Regular Multiball at the Warrior.\n\nRamp Hurry-up\n    A hurry-up starting at 3M, ticking down to 1M.  Shoot either ramp\nto lock the value.  For 20 seconds, both ramps will be worth that\nsame value.\n\nAir Attack\n    Same as Ground Attack, only with a 100k-900k scoring range.\n\nNuke Chase\n    Shoot the lit Nuke for 3M+250K.  The Nuke will move even if you\ndon't make the shot.  Lasts 25 seconds.\n\n9.  Extra Balls\nThere are at least five ways of collecting an Extra Ball.  Of course,\nI haven't been able to collect all of them due to some weird Lyle\nsettings.  No Extra Balls for me.  Anyway, here's a list of the EB's\nI know of:\n\n\n Play poorly.  A freebie EB will be lit on ball 3 if you have a score\nlower than 20-30M.\n\n 15 shots to an unlit Arm Nukes hole will award an Extra Ball.\n\n 50 ramp shots will light EB.  After that it's 100 ramps.  After that,\nI'm not sure.\n\n During Regular MB, light all Bug standup targets.\n\n Have some luck with the recon Level 5 or 6 award.  I have yet to see\nit actually award an EB though.\n\n10.  Miscellany\n\nRaise in rank\n By shooting the Arm Nukes hole a number of times, you can raise in\nin rank.  Four shots are needed to become Squad Leader (worth 5M),\nafter that it's N shots for Corporal (worth 10M).  I'm not sure\nwhat comes after that.\n\nEnd of Ball Bonus\n Your bonus is determined by the number of bugs killed during that\nball.  Hoppers and Warriors are worth 100K a piece.  I believe the\nsame applies to Plasma bugs and Tankers.  Brain bugs are worth\n300K.  The entire bonus is multiplied with the Bonus X value.\nYou increase bonus X by completing the B-U-G rollovers.\n\nShooting the Warrior\n The Warrior moves pretty slowly;  sometimes this means it hides\nthe sinkhole behind it.  When a critical shot like the Super\nJackpot is lit, it is good to know that, at all times, the Warrior\nstandup counts as the sinkhole.\n\nHigh-score table\n Apart from entering your initials, you get to choose a face to go\nalong with your name.\n\n11.  Spoilers\nSpoilers ahead!  Close your eyes and think happy thoughts in case you\nwant to find out just what happens at planet Klendathu for yourself.\n11.1  Klendathu\nOnce all five planets have been nuked and cleared from Bugs, planet\nKlendathu will be flashing.  Shoot the Recon scoop to start the attack\non Klendathu.  You get unlimited balls for 30 seconds.  To finish the\nmode, you must kill 9 Bugs of each species (all Bug standups are lit)\nand make all five Nuke shots.  The Nuke shots are worth 5M a piece,\nthe Double Nuke (collected at the Recon scoop) is worth 10M.  I assume\nthe Bugs are worth something as well, but the DMD doesn't display any\ninformation on that.  If you manage to kill all the Bugs and make all\nthe shots, you're awarded a 50M completion bonus.  Note that once the\ntimer has expired, the mode will continue with the balls still in\nplay.  I'm assuming the release software has induced a few changes\nto this mode;  with beta software, the mode continues until *all*\nballs have drained.\n11.2  Easter eggs\nWhen the military dude is briefing you (\"This planet has 8 Hoppers...\"),\npress both flipper buttons.  He will die a most gruesome death.\n12.  Known software glitches\n(note how I cleverly avoided the word \"bug\")\n\nOK, so I've been playing a machine with beta software.  I hope this\nhas been fixed in the release software:\n\nIt is possible to have Regular MB running with only one ball in play.\nAll other shots you'd expect to be active during regular play are there\nas well.  You can shoot jackpots and Super Jackpots forever and ever.\nHow and when this happens is unknown to me.\n13.  The mini-flipper\nThe first few times I played ST I quite simply ignored that extra flipper.\nBig mistake.  In order to control the ball in ST, you'll need to use it.\nFor instance, it's possible to drop-catch balls coming from the Recon scoop.\nIt's also good for slowing down balls coming from the right inlane, and\nthen catching it with the regular flipper.\n\nShoot Bugs with the mini-flipper, or at least try to make the machine\nthink you did!  It makes advancing through planets so much easier!\n\nYou may notice it's extremely hard (the word \"impossible\" comes to mind)\nto shoot the Arm Nukes hole with the regular right flipper.  While it's\npossible to do a bank-shot from the left flipper, try this instead:\nCatch the ball on the regular right flipper.  Holding this flipper up,\nflip the mini-flipper.  If you're lucky (1 time out of 3 perhaps), the\nball will land in the Arm Nukes hole.  I assume the odds for success\nvary from machine to machine.\n14.  Strategy\nSome thoughts:\n\nGo for Regular MB and Orbit MB - these can be worth huge amount of\npoints.\n\nWait with the Planet MB;  try to nuke more than two planets at the\nsame time.  This implies that you at some time shoot for bugs,\nwhich can be a hazardous venture.  Use the mini-flipper!\n\nShoot the left and right ramp for Recon Levels.  At level 5, you'll\nmore often than not be awarded Orbit MB.  Avoid level 6 - Orbit MB\nis worth more than 25M!\n\nMy best so far is 656M, best Regular MB is ~150M, best Planet MB ~270M,\nbest Orbit MB 95M.\n\nSee you at PAPA!\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Starship Troopers", "manufacturer": "SEGA Pinball, Inc.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/starshiptroopers.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Starship Troopers", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

(Really).\n Special at 50 Shuttles added. ;-)\n\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG), multiball, and anything related to\npinball or the series is most probably copyright by somebody, so watch that\nyou're not sued.\n\nNote: TAF is The Addams Family, IJ is Indiana Jones, JD is Judge Dredd,\nT2 is Terminator 2, HSII is High Speed 2 (or The Getaway), TZ is the\nTwilight Zone, and STTNG is an amazingly cool game.\n\nThe best comment about this game would have to be from Steve Baumgarten: This\ngame makes TZ look like a '60s Gottlieb in terms of rule complexity!\nA Note On ROMs\nThese rules are getting quite messy because there are so many ROMs, all of\nwhich differ in important ways; sorry if some of it is confusing. Most of the\nexplanations cater for 'newer ROMs' with notes describing 'older ROMs'. As to\nthe definition of new and old ROMs, well it's just a rough guide to explain\ndifferences you may experience between various machines. I intentionally left\nout actual ROM numbers because it would make things just too complicated.\nPlayfield Description\nI'm starting from the Left in/out lanes, and going the long way round to the\nright\n\n\nLeft Outlane  Has a kickback. The actual outlane is a bit of a scoop because\nof this, but I found the kickback was really easy to light.\n\nLeft Inlane  Starts Hurry Up on the right orbit (like Terminator 2 (T2)).\n'Light Hurry Up' is lit by getting to warp factor 6. The one thing I missed\nwas the 'Return Lanes Lit' noise from T2 .. I liked this a lot! The inlanes\nhave no roll-over switches, but they do have proximity switches. Don't\nworry if you don't know what a Proximity switch is, just rest assured that\nthe machine does know when a ball goes down an inlane. I have added\nJonathan's excellent description of how Proximity switches work, if you\nwant to know more.\n\nSlingshots  Finally there is a rule-sheet that doesn't say \"The usual type of\nslings\"! These slings are definitely not usual. They are similar to the\nnormal ones in that they try to bounce the ball to the opposite outlane,\nbut they are different in that each sling has a large gun on it. The guns\nare used to fire at different things (see below). The shape of the slings\nis different too; they are no longer triangular, but quadrilateral. Yes,\nthey have four sides - except the top side is angled so that the ball is\nfeed to the in/out lane area. The ball usually chooses the outlane as its\ndestination, and the rubberless posts don't exactly make saving fun. If the\nin/out divider was made a little longer, it would be perfect. Are you\nlistening Williams?\n\nGuns  Two Probe Launchers sit above each sling shot. The launches can swing\nout to shoot the ball into various shots, and break all the playfield\nplastics. The guns are big, and plastic - yet they look good too. Excellent\njob Steve, I must say. If a ball happens to land in a gun when it's not\nmeant to (i.e.: air-ball), the machine will let you launch a probe; all of\nthe usual awards are available too. If the ball is in a gun, but the player\ndoesn't shoot the ball, after a while the machine will announce \"Pull\ntrigger to launch ball\". It will then immediately kick the ball out itself.\nThis rule sheet refers to the guns as cannons, launchers and guns - they\nall mean the same thing, so don't get confused!\n\nLeft Targets   Three yellow stand-up targets in the same place as the left\nones on The Getaway (HSII). They are used to light the kickback and other\nthings during the game. To relight the kickback, just hit the one target\nthat's lit. I told you it was easy!. These targets are used to increase\nthe Ferengi Jackpot when that multiball is running. There is no direct shot\nfrom the flippers to the lowest target, which really sucks. Even when the\nkick back is lit, one of these targets will be lit; hit it to spot a roll-\nover lane [above the bumpers].\n\nSpinner  The left orbit is similar to Fish Tales. The spinners value is\nincreased by 1000 (maxing at 30,000) by the Time Rift targets (in normal\nplay). The spinner is lit to increase warps by the right inlane, or\nshooting the orbit when it's not lit. It remains lit for about 10 seconds.\nYou are only credited a warp factor or emblem shot if the ball comes out of\nthe right orbit, if it falls in the bumpers then the shot is incomplete.\nThe spinner can also be lit for Super Spinner, that is 10 million a spin.\nSee Warp factors, and The Spinner for more details.\n\nTime Rift targets  Two red stand-ups between the Spinner lane and the left\nramp. Used during the Time Rift mode, (Naturally: more later). During\nnormal play, the targets add 1000 to the spinner value up to a max of\n2500.\n\nDelta Quadrant  Left (or side) ramp very similar to the multiplier ramp in Dr.\nWho. This ramp is accessible by the full length upper right flipper. (Why\ndo so many games have upper right flippers?) The ramp normally diverts\nballs to a habitrail that crosses the playfield and goes to the right\ninlane. Undiverted balls go to the Borg ship to be locked, or for 3x\nJackpot. Warp factors can also be increased here, whether or not the ball\nis diverted.\n\nCommand Decision  Small sink hole next to the left ramp. Similar to the train\nwreck in TAF (The Addams Family). When lit it lets you choose which mode\nyou want to start next - you can even rerun modes you've already played;\nthe number of reruns is operator adjustable from 1, never or unlimited.\nThis can also be lit to Advance Rank, see more in the Advance Rank section.\n\nNeutral Zone  Similar, in position, to the left orbit on Twilight Zone. This\nconsists of three stand-up targets, with a hole in front of the third.\nThree lights can point to either target, or the hole. It is used to start\none of three really cool rounds. The weird thing about this is that there\nis no sensor in the actual hole, but rather the stand-up target behind it.\nSometimes the ball just needs to hit one of the targets, and sometimes it\nhas to hit a target, then fall into the hole. Most times the ball goes into\nthe hole, it hits one of the targets, however if the ball just plops into\nthe hole, the machine will credit a Command Decision shot. This is good\nsometimes, bad other times. On the other hand, if the ball hits some NZ\ntargets then falls into Command Decision, the machine will credit a NZ hit.\nWhy they did this, I don't know. I have made it clear whether the ball has\nto fall in the hole, or just hit a target - if hitting a target is all\nthat's necessary, it's ok if the ball falls in the hole too. Lock at the NZ\ncan be lit by lighting the NZ for one of it's multiballs - completing the\nround, then lighting the NZ again.\n\nAlpha Quadrant  Center ramp, in a similar position to the Left ramp on TZ.\nThis feeds balls to the left inlane, and is used during some rounds.\n\nStart Mission  A sink-hole like the Slot Machine in TZ, but in the centre/back\nof the playfield. Hard from the right flipper, but easier from the left. It\nis also used for the multiball jackpot, extra ball and a few other things\nthat will become clear soon.\n\nBorg Ship  Sitting above the center ramp, and the Start Mission hole is a\nfull-on model of the Borg ship. It looks really cool, as it's well lit, and\nlooks fantastic at the start of multiball. The left ramp can feed balls\ninto the ship, but be warned, they get shot back out towards the flippers -\n(like the Raptor pit in Jurassic Park), except that the balls start out in\nthe air! (This only happens at the start of multiball, or after a 3x\njackpot. Balls are normally diverted off the ramp.)\n\nBumpers  Three bumpers in the top right corner of the playfield. The bumpers\nhave 3 lanes at the top that are used to increase bonus multiplier (10x\nlights extra ball), very similar to T2. Balls put up the right orbit\nusually end up in the bumpers, and weak shots up the spinner lane also end\nup here. Bumpers advance the currently lit mode, and increase the Borg\nJackpot. Completing the roll-over lanes when bonus is at 10x, will award\nan increasing 10 million.\n\nQ target  A solitary stand-up below the left-most bumper. It advances the next\nlit mode, and is used during the mode: Q's Challenge.\n\nBeta Quadrant  Called the Shuttle Ramp, it's the right ramp which is like a\nshorter version of the one in T2 - yet it's very similar in shape to the\nlower right ramp in Dr. Who. It is a counter for extra balls, and lighting\nother things like the Holodeck and Command Decision. There is also a\nSpecial award at 50 Shuttles. It is supposed to give another special at 250\nShuttles, but it doesn't because of a bug.\n\nAwards are:\nHolodeck : 3,9,21,27,33,39,51,57,63,69,81,87,93,99\nCommand Decision : 6,12,18,24,36,42,48,54,66,72,78,84,96\nExtra Ball : 15,30,45,60,75,90\n\n2x Shuttle  Two red stand-ups on each side of the entrance to the Beta\nQuadrant (like the Lite Lock targets on White Water). When hit, they\nstart to flash, and remain this way for about 10 seconds. The targets\nwork independently; if you hit the ramp with one flashing, you get\n2 ramps (like 2x Bear Kicks on TAF), and if you hit the ramp with both\nflashing, you get 4 ramps.\n\nRight Orbit  This is the Hurry Up, Holodeck, lock, and light lock shots. It's\nsimilar to Dracula in that at the top there is a drop target, followed by a\nsink-hole. When the target is up (most of the time) the ball will bounce\naround and go into a bonus multiplier lane to the bumpers. Launched balls\nget shot right up this orbit and into the hole, thus it's imperative that\nthe launcher doesn't get weak.\n\nUpper Right Flipper  Full length that is used to shoot the left ramp, the\ncommand decision sink-hole, and can be used to shoot the Neutral Zone too.\n\nRight Targets   Three yellow stand-up targets in the same place as the right\nones on The Getaway (HSII). They are used to light the kickback and other\nthings during the game. To relight the kickback, just hit the one target\nthat's lit. <I told you it was easy!>. These are labeled Klingon\nAssistance, and are lit during Romulan Multiball. See Romulan Multiball in\nthe Neutral Zone for a lovely description of what they do. Even when the\nkick back is lit, one of these targets will be lit; hit it to spot a\nmultiplier lane [above the bumpers].\n\nRight Inlane  When lit (at warp factor 6) will start Super Spinner. A cool\nround that lights the spinner for 10 million a spin for a while. [Note:\nNewer ROMs provide the option to disable Super Spinner.] The inlane will\nalways light the left orbit to increase warp factors. See The Spinner for\nfor info regarding Super Spinner.\n\nRules\nMissions\nThere are seven missions, and an eighth 'Final Frontier' is started when the\nothers are completed. The modes aren't really that repetitive, no where\nnear as bad as Indi. The good thing is that every shot has a STTNG emblem\nat the entrance that lights when the shot needs to be hit. [Be aware: The\nemblem for Command Decision is obscured.]\n\nTotals from each mode are added to your score immediately, not during the bonus\ncount.\n\nThe lit mode is advanced by the bumpers, and the Q target.\n\n\nTime Rift  Timer starts at 20 seconds. You have all shots lit, shoot them for\n10 million each. The Time Rift targets add 5 seconds to the time (although,\nsome people say 10 seconds, while others say 1-3. I blame ROMs), 5 Million\nto the payout, and a quote (see below). Increasing payout value only works\n3 times, but the time can be increased as many times as you wish. It may\nalso be the case on some ROMs that the Time Rift targets reset the timer to\n24 seconds.\n\nTarget Quotes: \nTroi, \"We have gone back in time.\"\nGeordi, \"Captain, the computer is malfunctioning\"\nBeverly (?), \"Something's happening...\"\nRiker, \"Here we go again...\"\n\nStart Quote: \nWorf, \"Sensors are picking up a distortion in the space-time\ncontinuum\"\n\nWorm Hole  Timer starts at 20 seconds, payout value starts at 30 million.\nThe right ramp adds 10 million to the value, the spinner adds 1 million\na spin. Left ramp collects value and ends the mission.\n\nStart Quote: \nRiker, \"Hold on tight, this could get rough.\"\n\nDuring: \nPicard, \"Steady as she goes.\"\n\nFailure quote: \n\"What is our exact location?\" to which Data answers,\n\"Unknown, sir.\"\n\nSearch the Galaxy  This was a great round, with excellent quotes. Timer starts\nat 40 seconds, and you are told by Riker to plot a course for the Alpha\nQuadrant. Shoot the center ramp for 10 million, Picard will say \"Beyond\nBelief\", \"Excellent\", or \"Brilliant\" - There are probably more. You will\nnow be told to plot a course to the Beta Quadrant - shoot the right ramp\nfor 20 million. Now you'll be told to plot a course for the Delta quadrant,\nand (you guessed it), shoot the left ramp for 30 million. If you do it in\norder, you'll be told to shoot the Gamma Quadrant, which is the Neutral\nZone (target), for 50 million. One artifact for any 3 ramps, a second\nartifact if the order is correct and you shoot the NZ. Older ROMs score 10\nmillion per ramp only.\n\nStart Quote: \nNone, you are just told to shoot the Alpha Quadrant.\n\nBattle Simulation  Another favorite of mine. The timer starts at 20 seconds,\nshoot any hole (right orbit, Start Mission, Neutral Zone, or Command\nDecision) to load a launcher. The launcher will swing out, and you have to\npull the trigger to launch the ball into Start Mission or the Neutral Zone.\nNote that the timer stops while the guns are loaded; so if you make quite a\nfew successful shots, then miss, you have quite a while to get back into\nthe swing of things! You start at level 1, and each successful shot will\nadvance you one level. Each level is worth 10 times in millions (ie: level\n3 is worth 30 million), and Level 6 is the last level, worth 100 Million,\noften awarding Extra Ball if you get it. When you shoot from the right\ncannon (into the Neutral Zone) you don't have to get that ball into the\nhole, just hitting one of the targets is enough - although getting it in\nthe hole is a bonus, as the left launcher will be loaded. Excellent\nanimation, especially during level 6.\n\nQuotes: \nDuring the round, Picard's best complement is \"Fantasssssstic!\"\n\nQ's Challenge  Some shots will be lit, when you hit one shot it will be\nreplaced by another one. The Q target adds a new shot. The first shot is\n10 Million, then 20 million, then 30 etc - maxes at 100 million. There is\nno fixed timer for this round. Each shot times-out after about 10-15\nseconds if it's not hit. The mode ends when all shots time-out. This mode\ncontinues during factor 9 mode, and multiball, but the shots don't time\nout.\n\nStart Quotes: \nQ, \"Bonjour mon capitaan!\"\nPicard, \"Q, what are you doing here?\"\nQ, \"Why don't we play a little game?\"\nRiker, \"Q ... we don't have time for your games.\"\n\nDuring: \nQ, \"OK that's enough.\", \"Now try this!\", \"Not bad; not bad at\nall.\", \"That was too easy.\". For some of the best quotes, drain\nduring this round.\n\nRescue  You have 30 seconds to rescue 50 people. Each time a switch closes,\nanother person is added to the shuttle - so the bumpers would be the best\nplace for the ball. Shooting one of the two ramps (center or right) then\nrescues the people in the shuttle. Shooting Start Mission rescues 5 people,\nregardless of the contents of the shuttles. You get 5M for starting the\nmode, 1M for loading someone into a shuttle, 1M for saving anyone, 2M if\nsaved via transporter, and 50M for rescuing all 50 people.\n\nStart Quote: \nComputer, \"Evacuate all personnel.\" But the best one is when the\ncomputer says, \"Board the shuttle as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAsteroid Threat  20 Million counts down. Start Mission collects value and\nstops the timer, all shots light to recollect the same value. You can only\nhit each shot once. Once the 20 million reaches 5 million, you\nautomatically start the second part with all shots worth 5 million. There\nis 30 seconds to hit all seven shots - if you do it you get 50 million. If\nyou get Start Mission just as the asteroid is blowing up, you get credit\nfor it in the get-all-seven-shots part, but the shot remains lit.\n\nStart Quotes: \nPicard, \"Suggestions?\"\nData, \"We could destroy the asteroids in our path, sir.\"\nPicard, \"Make it so.\"\n\nDuring: \nPicard, \"Evasive maneuvers.\", \"Steady as she goes.\"\n\nFinal Frontier  This is yet another six ball multiball - Note that the guns\nare loaded at the start of this round, if you do nothing the machine will\nkick the balls out itself. The only reason it loads the guns is because\nit has to get the balls out somehow. Every shot will be lit (like in Time\nRift) and when any of them are hit, you get an obscene amount of points.\nThe amount of points is determined by the amount of Artifacts you have - to\nfind out how to get Artifacts, see the section 'Artifacts' in this rule\nsheet. At first you will be awarded 100M for each Artifact you have, as\nwell as this, each shot is worth 25M * number of Artifacts. (If you have\nNO artifacts, each shot will be worth 10 million. [I took the glass off,\nI'm not that bad!]) You will also be awarded a billion for each set of 4\nartifacts you have (if you have 2 of each artifact, you get 2 Billion).\nSome ROMs max out at 100M per shot, even if you have more than 4 artifacts;\nnewer ROMs max out at 250M and you can have a maximum of 10 sets of\nartifacts (40 artifacts total).\n\nNote: Older ROMs are slightly different. Every shot is worth a flat 50M,\nregardless of how many artifacts you have, and you don't get any bonuses.\nIf you encounter a machine like this, try and push for a ROM upgrade.\n\nArtifacts\nArtifacts are collected during the game and are used for the Final Frontier\nround. Each artifact is worth 50 million, and the computer will tell you when\nyou have collected one. See 'Final Frontier', under 'Missions' for information\non how Artifacts are used. You can collect each artifact more than once.\n\nArtifacts are: Singing Stone, Isolinear Chip, Diranium Sphere, and Dilithium Crystal\n\nArtifacts can be collected:\n\n\nBattle Simulation  Completion of level 5 awards an Artifact.\nSearch the Galaxy  If you hit the three ramps (any order) you get an\nartifact; if you do them in order then get the NZ, you get a second\nartifact.\nWorm Hole  Shoot the Delta quadrant for an Artifact.\nRescue  Any combination of 25 people rescued or sitting in the shuttle.\nShuttle Simulation  The ninth cavern contains an Artifact.\nAsteroid Threat  After three shots have been hit.\nTime Rift  Averages on five shots. [There is a bug in the software!]\nQ's Challenge  Making 5 shots awards an artifact.\nWarp Factor 8  Awards an artifact if it is not the first time at factor 8,\nor extra balls are disabled.\n\nPlunger Choices\nWhile waiting for the player to launch the ball, the display shows 5 choices\nwhich light up alternatively. Launch the ball when the one you want is lit.\nYou can speed this up with the flipper buttons, an excellent feature. The\nball is normally plunged into the hole at the top of the right orbit, but\nif it doesn't make it, there is no software compensation - so you'll have\nto really start hassling techs to get them to fix problems with the plunger\nor drop target. Plunger choices are:\n\n\nStart Mission  The ball will be launched into the sinkhole, and the\nflashing mission will start.\nFlipper Skill Shot  The ball gets launched into the sink-hole at the\ntop of the right orbit, and the display tells you to shoot the\nright ramp, and what you'll get. The ball gets popped to the left\nflipper. The awards I've seen are: extra ball, Special, 10\nmillion, Hold Multipliers, Advance Rank, Light Extra Ball, Warp\nFactor x, Advance in Rank, Double Spinner and Light Kickback.\nLaunch Probe  The ball goes into the sink-hole and a launcher is\nloaded. A shot will be lit (ramp/sink-hole etc) and if you get the\nthe shot, you are told your award (similar to the flipper skill\nshot awards). If you miss, you hear Data say \"The probe has\ndiscovered nothing, sir.\". The funniest was when I got 25 Mil\nData said \"The probe has discovered big points!\" Note: When the\nright ramp is lit, you only need to trigger the gate at the\nentrance. If the left orbit is lit, you only need to trigger the\nspinner.\nLight Lock  Lights, and locks the ball. You can only use this twice\nper multiball, the third time it is replaced by Light Holodeck. If\nlock is lit at the start of a ball, Light Holodeck will lock the\nball. The number of locks allowed before Light Holodeck replaces\nit, is operator adjustable. If the game is set for 5 balls, lock\ncan only be chosen once. Then it becomes Multiplier (advance\nmultiplier).\nWarp factor 4  Starts you off at Warp factor 4. See the section on\nwarp factor for more detail. If you have already been at warp 9,\nthis will be Warp Factor 2.\n\nWarp Factors\nThis is a great feature. Every ball starts at Warp 1 (unless you start at\nanother Warp because a plunger choice, or flipper skill shot). The right inlane\nwill light the spinner to increase warp. A shot to the spinner will also light\nit for advance warp. (Note: Warps are only advanced if the ball goes right\naround the left orbit - past the bumpers. If the ball dribbles into the\nmultiplier lanes, you will not be credited.) The left ramp will always increase\nwarp value unless you have been to warp 9. Each factor has it's own award:\n\n\n factor 2 Awards 5 million. \n factor 3 Sets jets at 1 Million-a-pop for the rest of the ball. \n factor 4 'Spinner' is lit. \n factor 5 'Multipliers Held' is lit. \n factor 6 Return lanes lit. \n factor 7 Double spinner. \n factor 8 Awards extra ball the first time, then an artifact. [If extra balls are disabled, it always awards an artifact.] \n factor 9 Start Factor 9 mode. (See below) \n\nFactor Nine Mode\nThis is great. Each shot to the spinner or left ramp increases the warp factor\nby .1. (You can always use the left ramp during factor 9 mode.) The first\nshot (to get it to 9.1) is worth 20 million, 9.2 awards 25m, 9.3 awards 30m\nand so on until 9.9 which is worth 60 million. You have 10 seconds to make\neach shot (which Geordi counts down), but it is quite hard. For some\nstrange reason, you are given 20 seconds to make the last shot (warp 9.9);\nalthough there is the cool quote \"Warp-drive failure in 15 seconds\" from\nGeordi. [NOTE: The timer does not stop at all during this round, so don't\nlock a ball, or shoot a sinkhole. No other timer behaves in this manner.]\n\nOnce you have finished Factor 9 mode, (after the time runs out, or when you\nreach factor 9.9), you return to factor 1. It is no longer possible to use\nthe left ramp to increase warp factors (but you can still use it in factor\n9 modes), and the plunger choice changes to Warp Factor 2. Older ROMs will\ncontinue to award the last value collected for the rest of the ball and the\nnext ball will start at factor 1.\n\nThe sound during this is fantastic, a really low rumbling-hum!\n\nQuotes: \nAs you build up the warp factor Picard says, \"Prepare for\nMAXimum acceleration.\". I would have loved it if they got Picard\nto say \"Lets open this baby up, and see what she can do!\"\nNeutral Zone\nHit the Neutral Zone three times to light it [Note: The ball doesn't have to\nfall into the hole to register a hit. Just as long as one of the three targets\nare hit]. Once this is done, all three lights will flash. Shoot the NZ (the\nhole) again, and one of three modes will start:\n\n\nFerengi  The right cannon will be loaded. If you shoot the NZ (targets),\nanother ball will be put into play. The NZ remains lit for 10\nseconds to add balls (up to 4 balls can be added). If a ball\ndrains, shoot the NZ again to get another. If the initial shot\n(from the right cannon) misses the NZ, you still have the NZ lit\nfor 10 seconds to add balls. It's just like playing a one ball\nmultiball. Older ROMs are different: The mode starts off as a\ntwo ball multiball if you miss the NZ, and three ball if you hit\nthe NZ, it's just one ball more than the new version really.\nRegardless of the ROMs, the jackpot (Start  Mission hole) is 10\nmillion * balls in play, and any of the yellow stand-up targets (on\nthe left) add 2 million to the jackpot. Ends when less than 2 balls\nremain in play.\n\nStart Quote: \nFerengi, \"Captain, our ship is disabled, we need Diranium\nSpheres, now. ... We need them NOW!\"\n\nDuring : \nFerengi, \"More Please\", \"Thank-you\". Cool.\n\nRomulan  Three shots will be lit, (spinner, alpha ramp and beta ramp) which\ncorrespond to the three Romulan ships on the display. When a shot\nis hit, the ship on the display cloaks (disappears) - and is\nreplaced by a timer. If the timer expires then the shot relights.\nThe mode ends if you can cloak all ships simultaneously. Each\ncloaked shot is worth 10M, and the round lasts 40 seconds. Hitting\n\"Klingon Assistance\" puts a Klingon ship up on the left or right\nside of the display, replacing the Romulan ship there.  This\ndoesn't give you the points for that ship, but it does lock that\nshot out of the mode, so you don't have to worry about it timing\nout and returning like it might if you actually shoot it.  Klingon\nAssistance doesn't work on the center ship, though.\n\nCloaking all ships is worth 30 million.\n\nStart Quotes: \nWorf, \"Sir, the Romulan's are hailing us.\"\nPicard, \"On screen.\"\nRomulan, \"We are conducting military exercises, it would be\nwise to change course immediately.\"\nPicard, \"Fire a warning shot.\"\n\nCardassian  This is a complex 2 ball multiball. The jackpot (at the Neutral\nZone targets) starts at 50 million, however the Enterprise is\nbeing shot at. The lower the shields, the lower the jackpot -\nright down to 5 Million when the shields are 0%. Shoot the\nspinner to increase shield strength (and thus, the jackpot\nvalue).\n\nShield status versus Jackpot value:\n\n\n Shields at 100% 50 Million \n Shields at  83% 30 Million \n Shields at  50% 25 Million \n Shields at  37% 20 Million \n Shields at  25% 15 Million \n Shields at  12% 10 Million \n Shields at   0% 5 Million \n\n\nStart Quotes: \nWorf, \"Sir, the Cardassians are hailing us.\"\nPicard, \"On screen.\"\nCardassian, \"Leave this territory, or be destroyed\"\n\nthen\n\nPicard, \"Let's try a friendly settlement.\"\nCardassian, \"Here's your settlement, Picard!\"\nBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM\n\nor\n\nPicard, \"Let's be diplomatic about this.\"\n\nHurry Up\nLike T2. It is lit at warp factor 6 and started by the left return lane. 50\nmillion counts down to 10 Million, shoot the right orbit to collect. Nice\ntaunting quotes too! When it's started, the Computer says \"Hurry Up,\nactivated.\" - cool.\n\nQuotes: \nRiker, \"NOW\".\nHolodeck\nThis is lit by right ramps (First at 3 then 9..) or skill shot. Once lit, a\nshot to the right orbit will let you choose 25 million, or Shuttle Simulation.\nThese are the only choices. (Hold the trigger in, and hit the right flipper\nbutton to play poker with Riker!)\n\n\n 25 Million  Self explanatory (Note: older ROMs are 10 million)\n\n Shuttle Simulation  A hard video mode similar to escape in the mine cart on\nIndi. The shuttle is traveling down a tunnel, fast. It starts off in\nthe center, and the flipper buttons can move it left or right or back to\nthe center, (Like HSII video mode). There are awards that appear (10 Mil)\nin the center, and obstacles (that appear anywhere) that you must avoid\nAt times the tunnel divides into 2 and if you're in the wrong place,\nyou quickly become acquainted with the wall. The animation is really\nquick, but the layout doesn't change. You are awarded 1 million per\ncavern, and there are 10 caverns. In the ninth is an Artifact that you\nmust run into for 50 million. There is a cavern counter in the top right\nof the screen. It really gets easier the more you play it, stick to the\nside, as this is the safest place to be when it divides. The trick\nis not just survival, but picking the right way to go. Most of the time\nthe caverns divide, one way will have 30 million (three 10 millions) and\nthe other way will have only one 10 million. The point remains that the\nsimulation never changes - Williams should have designed it to make a\nentire new cavern system every time the high-scores reset. There is an\nextra ball in there too. It has been found that:\nL-L-R-R-L-L-R-L-L-L- (L= Left, R= Right) awards 10M - 10M - 0M - 30M -\n30M - 30M - 0M -10M or Extra Ball - 30M - artifact for a total of\n159M + artifact (10 million less if you got the EB). You will NOT get the\nextra ball if you have gotten one that game already, and eventually\nduring that run of credits, it'll stop giving extra ball permanently. This\nmay not be true for earlier ROMs.\n\nMultiball\nAll modes except for Q's challenge stop during Multiball, but continue again\nafter. (Q shots don't even time out!)\n\nLock can be lit by shooting the right orbit (if you didn't light it when you\nlaunched the ball). Lock balls in the right orbit, or left ramp. You can also lock balls in the NZ by lighting the NZ for one of it's multiballs, completing\nthe round, then lighting the NZ again. You get 10 million for locking a ball, a\npretty animation and a quote (see below for the quotes/animations). When you\nlock the third ball, the playfield goes dark, except for the Borg ship, which\nlooks spectacular the way it's lit.\n\nThe left cannon will be loaded, fire the ball into Start Mission to raise the\njackpot by 10 million, and be awarded the value. The cannon will be loaded\nagain, shoot Start Mission to increase the base value by another 10 million,\nand get double jackpot. The cannon will be loaded a third time, shoot Start\nMission to add yet another 10 million to the base value, and get a very nice\ntriple jackpot. At this point (or if you miss any of the three jackpots),\nmultiball begins.\n\nAt the start of the game the base jackpot value is 20 million, this is\nincreased by the bumpers (even during multiball). The base value also goes up\nby 10 million at the start of multiball for each successful shot from the left\ncannon. During multiball, jackpots can be collected from Start Mission, and\ntriple jackpots can be collected from the left ramp. The Start Mission jackpots\ncycle through single, double and triple.\n\nMultiball isn't really three balls in a pinball machine, but rather the\nEnterprise in battle with the Borg. The object is to destroy the Borg ship,\nwhile keeping the Enterprise in one piece. As the Borg fire on us, the\nshields are being lowered. When they reach zero, the jackpot becomes unlit.\n(You can still get 3x on the left ramp though.) Shoot the spinner to relight\njackpot. The harder the spinner is hit, the longer it will be before you need\nto do it again. Subsequent multiballs unlight the jackpot more often. You can\nshoot the spinner earlier if you like, to stop the shields from lowering; Worf\nwill keep you informed on shield status, \"The shields are at 50% power.\", if\nyou shoot the spinner now, the shields will be raised again. Note: Unlike\nCardassian multiball, the jackpot value does not change with the condition of\nthe shields. When the shields fail (the jackpot turns off) you hear Geordi\nannounce that \"All shields are down.\" followed by a really cool 'binging'\nsound that somehow gets the attention of the whole arcade.\n\nOn older ROMs, the jackpot is always lit. Don't get confused though, as you\nstill hear comments regarding the status of the shields, it just shouldn't\nconcern you!\n\nLock 1: Admiral \"Enterprise, the Borg have entered Federation Space.\nIntercept IMMEDIATELY! Admiral Biagie out.\" The display shows the\nAdmiral talking - well synchronized with the sound.\n\nLock 2: Worf \"Sir, a strange object is dead ahead.\"\nPicard \"On screen.\"\nThe display shows a miniature Borg ship.\nPicard \"Magnify.\"\nThe ship on the display become full-screen.\n\nLock 3: Borg \"If you do not surrender, we will destroy your ship.\"\nThe display show a bunch of Borg.\nPicard \"We will never surrender.\"\nRiker \"Battle stations; ready weapons\" - with red-alert sirens etc.\nPicard \"Load phasers ... Fire when ready!\"\n\nor Lock 3: Picard \"Send to Starfleet; we have engaged the Borg.\"\n\nDuring Multiball: Borg \"You will assimilate\" and \"Resistance is futile\".\nThere is also lots of conversation regarding the state of\nthe shields, and the ship in general.\nRamps\nThe ramps behave the same was as they do in T2, except it's called Explosive\nMillions and it only involves the Center and Right ramps. For successive ramp\nshots, you are awarded 5-10-20-30 to 50 million. The bad thing is that after\none ramp is hit, both are lit to collect the millions. It is possible to just\nkeep hitting one ramp, I STILL hope this is changed.\nRanks\nCompleting the bonus Multiplier lanes lights Advance Rank at Command\nDecision.\n\n\nRanks: Ensign Lieutenant Lieutenant Commander CommanderCaptain.\nworth: 5M 10M 15 Million 20M 25M\n\n\nIf you are captain, and shot Command Decision (when lit for Advance Rank) you\nwill get 100 million. The values listed above are awarded during the bonus\ncount (note: 100 Millions are awarded instantly). How cool having something\nthat just adds to your bonus.\nCombos\nThere is only really one combo in this game, but it's so amazingly cool, I\ndecided to give it a whole section! The Picard Maneuver is the left orbit, left\nramp combo and get good at it!\n\n\n Builds Warp factors. The first time to factor 9, this combo increases\nwarp factor by 2. (As long as the left orbit is lit to advance warp.)\n Always adds .2 during factor 9 mode.\n Awards triple jackpot. It seems that the ramp is much easier to hit after\nthe left orbit shot.\n Awards the Picard Maneuver after you have been to warp 9. I don't think\nit awards any points, but the display shows the famous shot of the\nEnterprise hooning off into space, while Riker says: \"The Picard\nManeuver! Nicely done.\"\n\nThe Spinner\nGet good at hitting the spinner:\n\n\n Factor 4 lights 'Spinner' for 100 times the current value per spin\n When the right inlane is lit for superpinner, a ball through that inlane\nwill start the timed period of 10 million a spin. The Super Spinner light\nin the inlane indicates the remaining time (it flashes faster as time goes\non), rolling through the inlane again re-sets the timer. It seems that\nafter about 5 resets, it begins to time out quicker. Also, if you start\nWarp 9 mode when Super Spinner is timing-out, the Super Spinner will reset\ncompletely, that is, the S.S. light will be lit solidly -- no timer until\nthe inlane is hit again. Newer ROMs provide an option to disable Super\nSpinner.\n Factor 7 starts 'Double Spinner' which double the amount per spin that\nball.\n During Cardassian multiball, the spinner raises shield power, and thus the\njackpot value.\n During Borg multiball (newer ROMs only), the spinner relights the jackpot\nat Start Mission.\n During Worm Hole, the spinner adds 1 million per spin to the value.\n During Rescue, the spinner adds a person each spin.\n\nHigh Score Tables\nThere has been much discussion regarding the high score tables. I have\ncollected all info and dumped it here!\n\nThere are 4 high score tables:\n\n\n Grand Champion 0 or 1 Buy-Ins \n Honor Roll 0 or 1 Buy-Ins \n Officer's Club More than 1 Buy-In \n Q Continuum Score of 10 Billion or more (Any Number Of Buy-Ins) \n\n\nNote: Prototype ROMs only have the Honor Roll for any number of buy-ins\n\nRules for high score tables [L-x ROMs only]:\n\n\nIf your score beats the Grand Champion score, and you bought in one or fewer\ntimes, you get the Grand Champion score and nothing else.  When you beat the\nGC, the old score is bumped onto another high score table as appropriate; if\nit qualifies for Q's Continuum it goes there, otherwise it goes on the Honor\nRoll.\n\nIf your score is better than the #4 Q's Continuum score (but not the GC), you get\non that. Buy-ins don't matter.\n\nIf none of the above, your score is checked against the Honor Roll OR\nOfficer's Club lists, depending on the number of buy-ins.  One or fewer\ngoes on the Honor Roll, more than one goes on the Officer's Club.\nOnly if your score is high enough to make the lists, of course.\n\n\nA major bug with the high score table: it seems that the Q's Continuum list is\nthe only one capable of handling scores over 1OB.  For example, a local STTNG\nhas a Grand Champ score of 18 billion.  During the game, at the ball 3 display,\nit reads \"Highest Score 18,....\" but on the actual table it reads \"Grand\nChampion 8,....\"  Lord knows why.\n\nAlso, scores that don't make the Q's Continuum list, but which are still higher\nthan 1OB, seem to be ignored entirely, or are compared with the other lists\nwith the leading digit removed.\nProximity Switches\nProximity switches work via an induction coil -- the same thing your local\ntraffic light uses to sense cars at an intersection.  Any metallic object that\npasses through the coil's field changes the resistance of the field.  The\nsensor's circuitry detects these resistance changes and uses them to close/open a switch on the switch matrix.\n\nTwilight Zone used the first proximity switches which had hard-wired coils\ninlaid directly onto the pc board.  The whole board was then mounted where\nit could detect the balls (under the right trough switch and on the main\ntunnel just above the slot kickout).  This worked very well, but the\nsensitivity was not adjustable and ball vibrations tended to damage the\npc-boards.\n\nStar Trek uses a different board called the Proximity Sensor III.  (What\nwas I or II ?).  This uses a detached sensor which for TNG is mounted just\ninboard of the two inlays on the inlanes, right in the corners of the\nslingshots under the guns.  They are mounted in holes drilled from the bottom\nand rest just under the surface of the playfield.  The pc boards have variable\nresistors on them to allow you to adjust the sensitivity -- all the way from\nno sense to always on!\nSaving\nGet good at saving. As I've stated many times, the outlanes are terrible.\nIf the ball decides it's going to outlane drain, you have little hope of\nchanging its mind. - Many people have mailed me saying things like \"just\nnudge the machine and the ball will move away from the area so it's not as\nbad as you make it sound.\" Isn't this saving?\n\nBang Backs were not possible on Indiana Jones because of the way the drain\narea was constructed - STTNG is the same, so I doubt Bang backs will work.\n\nDeath Saves are possible but hard, as the machine is really heavy. I've\nseen people death save a lot and I can do it semi-regularly, but it often\nuses a lot of tilt warnings (my machine is set to 5). It seems that the legs\nare thicker than the old type because of the weight of the machine. If you\nare going to Death Save .. wear heavy shoes.\n\nSometimes I've found that the ball falls out of the Borg Ship during a\nDeath Save . This is especially good if\nthe Death Save didn't work, as you get another ball to play with. The\nmachine realises what has happened, and copes beautifully - It knows that\nthere is an extra ball in play, and won't start the bonus count.\nExtra Balls\nExtra balls can be earned the following ways:\n\n Warp Factor Eight (First time through warps only)\n 10x Multiplier\n Light (or collect) Extra Ball from Skill Shot\n Light (or collect) Extra Ball from Launch Probe\n 15 Shuttle Ramps\n Level Six of Battle Simulation [See note below]\n Shuttle Simulation: L-L-R-R-L-L-R-L-L-L-. (L=Left, R=Right). {This may\nnot be true on all ROMs}. [See note below]\n You can buy them. The default is for three buy-ins; settings range from\n1, 2, 3, unlimited.\n\n\nNote: You cannot always get extra balls from Shuttle Simulation and Battle\nSimulation. It seems that if you are doing well, Battle Simulation stops\nafter level 5 (regardless of how much time is left); and the EB in Shuttle\nSimulation becomes a 10 million. It would, therefore, be worth while going\nfor these two EBs as early as possible. Just to ad ANOTHER kink in this\nspaghetti rule sheet ... Richard Horrocks claims that a lot of machines he's\nplayed will award these EB with a good score, and after a lot of other EBs.\nGo figure.\nEaster Eggs\nSome Easter Eggs, bugs and other cool things:\n\nPoker with Riker: In the Holodeck when you are presented with the choice\nof 25 million or Shuttle Simulation, hold in the trigger and press the\nright flipper button to play poker with Riker.\nFrozen Timers - When you have Hurry Up and Factor 9 mode running at the\nsame time, the timers will stop. This is really nice if you start hurry\nup when factor 9 is already running, as the 50 million doesn't count\ndown. When you finish factor 9 mode, or collect the hurry up, everything\nstarts up again. This is fixed in new ROMs - damm damm dammmm.\nHigh Q: Q's Challenge continues to run during multiball, but the shots\ndon't time out. Start multiball when Start Mission is a Q Shot, and\nyou'll end up with an obscene Q score.\nSecret Mission: When the right ramp lights a holodeck, the display says\n'Holodeck x ready'. When x is 3, pull the trigger three times. It's a\n20 second frenzy where every target is worth a weird number of points,\nand every target causes the communicator sound - very cool.\nAsteroid Threat: If you get Start Mission just as the asteroid is\nblowing up, you get credit for it in the get-all-seven-shots part, but\nthe shot remains lit.\nSecret Video Mode: The manual talks about a secret video mode, I doubt\nthis is Poker; chances are it's brick-out - I saw brick-out on the\ndisplay once during attract mode. There are 2 settings regarding this in\nthe menus, so it must be a big thing.\n\nThis is what the manual says about it:\n\nA.2 14 Video Mode On\nThis determines whether or not the hidden video mode is\navailable to players.\nSettings: ON = Hidden Video Mode is available  (*)\nOFF = Hidden Video Mode is NOT available\n\nA.2 15 Video Mode Attract\nThis determines whether or not the hidden video mode, (if\navailable to players) is part of the attract mode.\nSettings: ON = Hidden Video Mode is part of Attract Mode\nOFF = Hidden Video Mode isn't part of Attract Mode (*)\n\n(*) = Factory Setting\n\nTo get this secret video mode, on the first ball hit a flipper x\nnumber of times and choose light lock. Then on the second ball, hit a\nflipper y number of times and choose light lock. Then on the third ball,\nhit a flipper z number of times and choose light holodeck. This is all\nfact, although the exact values of x, y and z are unknown; as are\nwhich flippers to hit.\nWhen the first ball is locked, we get a message from Admiral Biagie,\nwell this is from Carl Biagie who's name is listed on the inlanes.\nHidden Image (that appears in the game): When the ball goes in the\nAdvance Rank / Command Decision hole when nothing is lit, pull the\ntrigger to see a limo drive past some buildings. It's a nice picture...\nThis picture can also be seen at the start of multiball; fire the first\nshot, miss the second, then hit both flippers. There are probably plenty\nmore occurrences...\nHidden Images (that don't appear in the game): Hidden in the depths of\nthe ROMs are a few pictures that seem to just take up space:\nBorg doing 'kinky' things (Borg with a very nice young lady...)\nSPD (?)\nSteve Ritchie's Easter Egg: To see the logo's of all of Steve Ritchie's\npast games, enter this combination during a game, or in attract mode:\nRR L R B R B LLLLLLLL R LLLLL R LLLLL R LLLLLL RR\n[R = Right flipper, L = Left flipper, B = Both]\nLetter-wise it spell A HEEF .. but it probably means 8/5/56. Now because\nit American I assume it means 5 August 1956; but I think rain is wet so\nwho am I to judge...\n\nAttract Mode Stuff\n\n Flipper Buttons: Yield the doorbell sound, followed by Picard's \"Come!\"\n Start with no credits: A cool phaser sound.\n Trigger: Another cool phaser sound!\n\n\nWhen the game is idle for a while, a game of Brick Out will be played on the\ndisplay. This is an example of the legendary Secret Video Mode, there is no way\nfor a player to effect this.\nMisc Things\nAfter a good multiball (a triple jackpot or 2), during the match sequence\nPicard says, \"Captains log, supplemental. The crew have performed admirably\nin dispatching the Borg threat\"\n\nTilt Quotes: One of three:\n\n Q, \"Someday you'll learn to play pinball.\"\n Worf, \"You are without honor.\"\n Borg, \"Pinball is irrelevant.\"\n\n\nIf you're not doing well, then at the start of your third ball, Picard will\nwhisper \"Good Luck!\".\n\nMysterious Quote: In the sound test, there is a sample where Troi says, \"I\nbelieve they have evil intentions.\" The first person to find this quote\nin the game will get a lollypop from me!\n\nFlipper bonus: At anytime during play if you hear Data say, \"Had you\npropelled the ball along the proper trajectory, you would have been\nrewarded\"; press both flippers and Picard will interrupt with \"Thank\nyou Mr. Data\", and you will be awarded 10 million. This happens during\nregular game-play and Fun With Bonus.\n\nBonuses: \nTotals: 1 Million per mission\n1 million per warp factor (eg: factor 5 gets 5 million)\nAssociated value for your rank (see Ranks).\n\nOnce again, this is different for newer ROMs (why can't they just stick\nwith LA-1 and just fix bugs? It would make my life easier.) Newer ROMs\nalso take into account the fact that you start at factor 1 after warp 9.\nFor example, if you start at Warp 1, go all the way through 9.9, and end\nup at Warp 5 again (due to the reset at 9.9), you get 22M (9M for getting\nto Warp 9, 9M more for the nine warps to 9.9, and 4M more for raising it\nfrom Warp 1 back to Warp 5). Basically it's 1 million for every warp shot\nmade that ball.\n\nMultipliers: Completing the three lanes above the bumpers increases the\nmultiplier, and lights Advance Rank. Multiplier goes 2x, 4x, 8x, 10x\nwith extra ball lit. After 10x, you get an increasing 10 million each\ntime you complete the three lanes. One of these lanes can also be\nspotted by hitting the lit light kickback target while the kickback\nis lit.\n\nOutlane drain: \nQ, \"Someday you'll learn to play pinball.\" In a really\npatronizing tone!\nQ, \"HAHAHAHAHA\" - very cool. I laughed at this poor guy when the machine\ndid this to him! \nQ, \"And you were doing SOOO well...\".\nQ, \"Lose something?\"\nQ, \"What a pity..\"\n\nHigh Score: Worf, \"You are a honorable player.\"\n\nStart Of Game: Picard, \"Welcome to the Enterprise.\" - I always expect him to\nadd, 'Can I take your order please?'!\n\nAdding a new player: \nBeverly, \"Welcome aboard.\"\nthen: Riker, \"Report to the bridge.\"\nthen: Q, \"I want to play!\"\n\nBuy-In: A bought extra ball will give you Command Decision before launching;\nthat is you get to choose which Mission to start. The normal skill shot\ndoesn't happen. Buy-Ins can be set from Off, to 1, 2, 3 or unlimited - the\ndefault is for 3 buy-ins in new ROMs. The kickback will be lit for a bought\nextra ball.\nStrategies\nBeing accurate with the Cannons\nShooting the NZ and SM accurately (from the guns, that is)... Here is\nJ. Abernethy's secret... Hope it helps:  There are a couple of screws\non the slingshots... For the left gun, wait until the metal starts to\n\"cover\" the one of the screws (I forgot which one), and then it will\nalways hit SM... From the right, wait until the actual GUN starts to\ncover the screw... Hits NZ.  I can almost ALWAYS get the EB from\nbattle simulation... I always pick that one on Command decision...\nEven if I'm replaying it.\n\nIf you have a lot of time left during Battle Simulation, and the kickback is\nnot lit, fire the ball out of the gun into the lit kickback target. This is GREAT\nwhen the lit target is a lower one.\nExtra Ball Strategies\nIf the machine is in a good mood and giving out random EBs (this usually\nhappens after quite a few bad games), go for Skill Ramp at the start and\nyou have quite a good chance of getting extra ball lit. If you do get a\nlit EB DON'T collect it, but shoot the Beta ramp twice more then do the\nShuttle Sim. Almost every time I then get the Shuttle Sim EB, and can then\ncollect the lit EB from Start Mission.\nMisc Strategies\nGo for the holodeck often. Once you get good at it, can be worth an easy\n209M or so, not to mention artifacts and extra balls.\n\nMultiball can be HUGE! Go for it as much as possible. If the choice is\nbetween starting Final Frontier and starting Multiball, take Multiball.\nChances are you will light extra ball with the multipliers and be able to\nplay FF as well. Then again, with FF being so high scoring on newer ROMs, you\nmay like to take that first.\n\nStarting at Warp Factor 4 can be very lucrative as it makes lighting extra\nball (at warp 8) a lot easier. The one million-a-pop bumpers are also nice as\nyou can let the ball drain (ball saver) and it will be re-launched into the\nbumpers. This is especially nice at the start of multiball when the ball\nsaver is on far a beautiful length of time! Personally, I always start with\nwarp factor 4 as it's easy to get all the goodies from the higher warp factors.\nI also sometimes hold back from factor 9, mainly to make it easier to reach\nfactor 5 (multipliers held) which makes it easier to get to 10x and light extra\nball.\n\nShoot the right orbit.  A lot.  A lot. A lot.  Really.  This locks the\nball if it's lit, lights the lock if it isn't (and sometimes locks it\nanyway; the ball bounces off the target blocking the lock, off the top of\none of the lanes, and back up into the lock), and feeds the ball into the\nlanes and bumpers, which rack up millions (if you chose Warp 4), advance\nthe multipliers, light extra balls, build your Borg jackpot to ludicrous\nlevels, and generally make your life worthwhile.\n\nShoot the left orbit.  A lot.  It gives warp factors, big spinner\npoints (if you chose Warp 4), sometimes feeds the bumpers (see above), and\notherwise feeds the left ramp for more warp factors and ball locks.\n\nDuring multiballs, don't forget about the other nifty things you can\nstill be doing besides the object of the multiball; hitting the lanes and\nbumpers, and relighting the kickback.  (Whenever the Neutral Zone is lit,\nmake a note of which target is lit for kickback; during multiball that\nlight may be off or the whole bank may be lit, but the target that was lit\nbefore will still relight the kickback.)\n\nLaunching a probe is also good as the awards are often quite nice (extra\nballs or hold multipliers etc.) Although sometimes the machine would be a real\nbitch and light the center ramp for the probe shot.\n\nAs for the flipper skill shot, I rarely chose it, but it often gave away\nspecials, and for the better players can be very awarding.\n\nTry and go for that 10x bonus multiplier .. it multiplies the whole bonus,\nand if you've managed to get the multipliers to 10x, chances are you already\nhave a nice big bonus, which can become huge!\n\nMake sure the kickback is lit, you'll need it A LOT!\n\nWhen you enter your initials, use the trigger to lock in the letters,\nnot the start button.  It looks cooler.\n\nFinally, NEVER play doubles with Richard!\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic@niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/startrekthenextgeneration.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Star Trek: the Next Generation", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "                 \t BK's PAPA 4 Strategy Guide\n\t\t   ----------------------------------------\n\t\t   Williams' Star Trek: The Next Generation\n\n--- Tournament Settings --- and lots of 'em!\n\n\t\"Return to Duty\" (ball saver) is disabled.\n\tInstead of \"Light Lock\", the skill shot choice will be \"Bonus\nMultiplier\".\n\tIn Ferengi Multiball, you only get 8 seconds to shoot the Neutral Zone\nto add balls to the multiball.\n\tNo mode reruns allowed from Command Decision until all other modes\nhave been completed.\n\tThe kickback starts unlit each ball.\n\tWhen Holodeck becomes lit, the display will always read \"Holodeck 3 Is\nReady.\"  (Hint hint, nudge nudge.)\n\tIf you select a Flipper Skill Shot or Launch Probe, the award you get\nwill be fixed.  The first of either will be for \"Hold Multipliers\", the second\nwill light the kickback, and the third will double the spinner value.\n\t\"Super Spinner\", normally lit after Warp Factor 6, will not be\navailable due to its high scoring potential.\n\tIf a player enters the Final Frontier mode without any artifacts, each\nshot in the mode will be worth a paltry 1OM.  So don't do it.\n\tNo replays or extra balls.  Collecting a lit \"special\" will award 25\nmillion points.\n\tObviously you won't be able to buy an extra ball, no matter how much\nmoney you've got.\n\t\n\n--- Skill Shot ---\n\n\tThe Skill Shot is player-controlled; pull the gun trigger when the\naward you want is lit.  The awards are: Start Mission, Flipper Skill Shot,\nLaunch Probe, Bonus Multiplier, Warp Factor 4.  Warp 4 will be Warp 2 if you've\nbeen to Warp 9 in the game.\n\tI give the highest precedence to the Q's Challenge mission; if it's lit\nI go for that immediately.  If not, I'll take Warp 4 if that's available.  If\nnot, I usually take the lit mission just to get closer to Final Frontier.\n\tDon't take Flipper Skill Shot or Launch Probe, ever.\n\n\n--- General Strategies ---\n\nMultiball: Start multiball by making three locks, either to the Borg Ship via\n\tthe left ramp or via the right orbit.  A shot to the right orbit lights\n\tboth the ramp and orbit locks, but you must make the third lock via the\n\torbit.  At the start of multiball, the left Probe gun is loaded.  Here,\n\taccuracy in shooting Mission Start is very important; three successful\n\tshots score at least 26O million and add 3OM to the base jackpot.\n\n\tDuring multiball, shoot Mission Start for 1x, 2x, 3x Jackpots, and\nshoot the Left Ramp for 3x Jackpots.  After a left ramp shot, the ball is shot\nback at you from the Borg Ship.  It may be easier to loop Mission Start.\n\n\tUnless you get those Probe shots at the start of multiball, the\njackpots won't be worth nearly enough for a good score.\n\n\nMissions: Shoot Mission Start to begin a mission.  (Brilliant!)  You can also\n\tstart your choice of mission from Command Decision.  Some missions are\n\teasier than others, and all missions give you a chance to collect\n\tArtifacts, which are worth super points if you get to the final\n\tmission, the Final Frontier.  The missions, and what to do:\n\n- Time Rift: Time Rift targets add time to the clock and 5M to the payout on\n  the 7 big shots in the game.  Artifact for shooting Time Rift 3 times; don't\n  bother trying unless you know you can get the ball back off those targets.\n- Worm Hole: Shoot left ramp for 3OM or more, plus an Artifact.  E-Z!\n- Asteroid Threat: Shoot center hole for hurry-up; that value for each of the\n  7 shots.  Artifact for 3 of those shots.  Unless you can hit the center hole\n  right away, just wait and the second stage starts automatically.\n- Battle Simulation: Shoot the Probe guns into Mission Start & Neutral Zone.\n  After you miss once, let this time out -- not worth the trouble.  Artifact\n  for 5 successful Probe shots.\n- Rescue: Close 45 switches to load the shuttles, then shoot Alpha or Beta ramp\n  to save them.  Go for the spinner.  2O switches collects an easy Artifact.\n- Search Galaxy: Shoot Alpha, Beta, Delta ramps.  Any order collects one\n  Artifact, in order lights Neutral Zone for another.  Go for the gusto.\n- Q's Challenge: Easily the most lucrative mode.  First lit shot worth 1OM,\n  second 2OM, 3OM, etc. to a maximum of 1OOM.  Shoot the spinner -> ramp combo\n  over and over again, and your score will fly so high so fast you won't know\n  what happened until you look up.  Artifact for 5 shots.  If you doubt the\n  power of Q mode, my best score in the mode is 1.755 billion.  No foolin'.\n\n\tAll modes completed lights Final Frontier, where every shot is worth\n25M * Artifacts collected.  In addition, you get a billion bonus if you got at\nleast one of all four types of Artifacts.  Which one you get in a particular\nmode is apparently random.\n\n\tIn addition, there is a \"Secret Mission\" unrelated to these.  Pull the\ngun trigger when the game says \"Holodeck program is ready\" and you enter a\nFrenzy mode.  Not many points, but fun.\n\n\tIf you are having trouble shooting Start Mission, trap the ball first,\npreferably on the left flipper.  Makes it easy, really.\n\n\nWarp Factor: Advance Warp Factor by the spinner, or by the side ramp if you\n\thaven't been to Warp 9 yet.  This usually happens quickly as WF 4 is\n\ta good Skill Shot choice.  What you get for the warps:\n\n- Warp 2: 5 million\t\tCrap!\n- Warp 3: Lite Million Jets\tCrap!\n- Warp 4: Lite Spinner\t\tWell worth the trouble to get, 1OOK/spin plus.\n- Warp 5: Hold Multipliers\tCan be worth lots if you've Advanced Rank.\n- Warp 6: Light Hurry Up\tCrap!!  We want Super Spinner, dammit Jim!\n- Warp 7: Double Spinner\tBe sure to boost Spinner via Time Rift first.\n- Warp 8: Award Artifact\n- Warp 9: Warp 9 Mode\t\tShots to Warp Factor 2OM, 25M... 6OM max.\n\n\tTry to get Warp 9 mode and Hurry Up at the same time; this freezes the\nround timer on Warp 9 mode so you can go through for all 9 shots.  Total on the\nmode is 36OM if you can make it.\n\tDouble Spinner is the best of the bunch, though.  It can make the\nspinner's score overwhelm everything else in the game, if you can get to it\nenough times.\n\n\nRight Ramp Looping: An unusual strategy which may work; shoot the Right Ramp.\n\tConsecutive shots are worth 5M, 1OM, 2OM, 3OM, 4OM, and unlimited 5OM.\n\tAlso, the Right Ramp is used to light Command Decision and Holodeck for\n\tmore points.  If you can master the shot, you can loop it forever.\n\n\nNeutral Zone: Don't bother; it's a pain.  The only advantage of NZ is a throw-\n\taway multiball which you can use to bang on Time Rift or the Warps.\n\n\nSummation: ST:TNG is very complex.  I'll try to list the best opportunities for\n\tbig points in order of their payoff:\n\n1. Build spinner value via Time Rift / Warp 7; at maximum, 5OOM per shot.\n2. Q's Challenge mode worth up to 2OOM for each Picard Maneuver.\n3. All modes lead to Final Frontier for billions in bonus and 1OOM a shot.\n4. Multiball jackpots can be worth up to and over 15OM.\n5. Warp 9 Mode worth 36OM for completion.\n6. Right ramp up to 5OM / shot, lights Holodeck for over 1OOM in bonus.\n\n\tBe successful with two or three of these strategies, and you'll be\ngolden.  I usually try for a combination of 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n\n--- Point-Specific Strategy ---\n\nIf you need...\tTry doing this!\n\n5 million:\tShoot something, anything.\n2O million:\tShoot right ramp repeatedly or Mission Start once.\n5O million:\tNext mission, or a few trips on the Spinner.\n1OO million:\tHolodeck will cover it; or a well-played Mission.\n2OO million:\tUsually, multiball will get you this level of scoring.\n5OO million:\tStart Q's Challenge, or go for Warp 9 mode.\n1 billion\n  or more:\tGo for the Final Frontier.  It's not impossible to reach.\n\n\n--- Techniques ---\n\nFlipper Passing: Best strategy is to let the ball roll off the flipper to the\n\tother.  Post transfers are possible but not recommended; in addition,\n\tthe right flipper is optical, which makes this even more difficult.\n\tUse the spinner if you need the ball at the upper flipper.\n\nDeath Saves: Doubt it -- as usual, it depends on the game's tilt sensitivity,\n\tand games at PAPA tournaments tend to be quite sensitive.  If you're\n\tgoing to try one, use the gun; it gives much more leverage.\n\nBang Backs: No no no.\n\nNudging: Nudging is a big part of ST:TNG, and the nudging must be done around\n\tthe outlanes.  To save a ball headed for the outlane, push slightly\n\tforward when the ball reaches the top of the slingshot.  It should head\n\tfor the kickback targets and back into play.\n\n\n--- Scoring ---\n\n\tAverage scores on ST:TNG could be anywhere; in doubles qualifying, I'd\nguess the average will be around 3OO-5OO million.  The best scores, I expect,\nwill be well over 2-3 billion, maybe more than 5 billion for those who can get\nto Final Frontier.\n\nHigh Scores to Date:\tHal Erickson (CA)\t18.5 billion\n\t\t\tLyman Sheats, Jr. (IL)\t17.9 billion\n\t\t\tBrian Dominy (GA)\t 6.9 billion\n\n\tAll these games had one buy-in, as far as I know.  Dave Hegge's doubles\npartner has also scored more than 1OB, but I didn't get his name.\n\n\n--- For More Info ---\n\n\tIf you need ST:TNG's full rules, get Cameron Silver's rule sheet by\nanonymous ftp.  FTP rahul.net; go to the Pinball Archive (cd pub/sigma/pinball)\nand type \"get PAPA/sttng.rules\".  The PAPA folder includes information about\neverything involving PAPA 4; the rules for each game, prize money, the message\nyou get from 1-8OO-FLIPOFF, and these Strategy Guides.\n\tAccording to Dave Peller and Steve Baumgarten, the above are the\nofficial tournament settings, but these are (of course) subject to change.  The\nfinal settings should be available at the tournament.\n\tIf there's anything you'd like to add to this, just contact me:\nbowen@cardinal.stanford.edu.

The Picard Maneuver is the left\norbit, left ramp combo and get good at it!\n\nAbout the above combo.  Someone told me that he saw Lyman use this\ncombo during Q's Challenge to get \"billions\" of points. Apparently\neach half of the combo lights the opposite half for a Q shot.  I've\ntried and tried this and the most I have ever done was a measly three\nPicard Maneuvers in a row.  Maybe I'm too old for this(hint: I was born\nthe same year as my only pin, the first flipper machine Humpty\nDumpty).  Any of you youngsters able to consistently hit this shot. I\nrealize I will never be close to Lyman, but there must be some hint on\nhow to hit the left ramp. Sometimes I hit the ramp but it only goes\nhalf way up. Does how hard or how fast you push the flipper button\naffect the speed of the ball. I always assumed it was just an on/off\nswitch like my old machine, but when I release the switch quicker\nit seems to make the ball go faster.\n--\nPaul Fernquist\nuunet: pfern@technix.mn.org\nemail: ...!uunet!cs.umn.edu!kksys!edgar!technix!pfern\n\n----------------------- Headers -----------------------\nNewsgroups: rec.games.pinball\nPath:\nsearch01.news.aol.com!newstf01.cr1.aol.com!uunet!europa.eng.gtefsd.com!news.umbc.edu!eff!news.duke.edu!news-feed-1.peachnet.edu!umn.edu!newsdist.tc.umn.edu!uum1!kksys.com!edgar!technix!pfern\nFrom: pfern@technix.mn.org (Paul Fernquist)\nSubject: The Lyman Maneuver\nOrganization: Private system, St Paul, MN\nDate: Thu, 4 Aug 1994 16:41:41 GMT\nMessage-ID: \nLines: 25\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "STTNG", "possible_shots": "left orbit, left ramp combo", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/startrekthenextgeneration-notes2.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

(So is TRI-BALL,\nI would guess.)\n\nMusic by Brian Schmidt..(Totally Cool)\nImportant Stuff\nThis section describes locations and shots on the playfield that will be\nreferred to in the discussion.\n\n\nTHE RAMP  Pretty obvious. Hitting the ramp is the key to many different\nawards in the game.\n\nTHE FORCE  An eject hole located above the left flipper. When lit, it will\naward the current Force Award. When unlit, it counts as a\nDARK SIDE shot.\n\nX-WING TARGETS  Five yellow targets located in various places on the\nplayfield.\n\nSARLACC PIT  An eject hole located on the right side of the machine above\n2 X-Wing Targets. When the white light is lit, this scoop\nwill award Jabbas Bounty.\n\nDEATH STAR  Besides a giant silver globe that revolves around, the actual\nDeath Star shot is the yellow target underneath the Death Star.\nThis target also opens up as a shot to start Tri-Ball.\n\nRELAUNCH  A kickback located in the left outlane.\n\nTRI-BALL  3 ball Multiball...Go figure..:-)\n\nRIGHT ORBIT SHOT  The shot through the right outer loop that will pass\nthrough R2-D2 and return to the 4 pop bumpers.\n\nLEFT ORBIT SHOT  Shot through the pop bumpers that will travel back\nbehind R2-D2 and the Death Star and return (hopefully)\nto the flippers.\n\nC3PO EYES  The best name I could think of for this shot. :-) The shot\nlocated in between the Death Star shot and the Right Orbit\nshot. The ball travels to a hole behind the Death Star where\nit is returned to the left flipper via the habitrail that\nruns along the left side of the machine. Awards vary depending\non what has been lit when you make this shot.\n\nHYPERSPACE DROP TARGETS  Three drop targets located to the left of the\nramp entrance. Knocking these down three times\nlights the ramp for HyperSpace.\n\n\nThe Rules\nSKILL SHOT:\nWhen the game begins, you are presented with a 'Skill Shot'. (A video game\nif you ask me.) Basically, you have to hit the lever button when a Tie-\nFighter is in the sights on the display. A successful hit will score a\nmillion plus a million per current ball number.\n\nSuccessful skill shots score:\n\n\n    ball 1 - 2 million\n    ball 2 - 3 million\n    ball 3 - 4 million\n\n\nThe key to this is leading the shot a little bit, so you fire the lever\nright before the fighter enters the sight.\nTHE RAMP:\nThe ramp on SW is almost identical to the ramp on LW3. The extra ball from\nthe ramp will be lit at anywhere from 3 ramps to 99 ramps, depending on\nhow many games have been played. You will receive 3 million for 3 ramps,\n7 million for 7 ramps, then 14, 21, etc. A unique thing about the SW ramps,\nis that after a certain number of consecutive shots, the force hole will\nbe lit, or a Force award will be awarded. Also, every shot up the ramp\nspots a letter in STAR WARS.\nSTAR WARS:\nSpelling STAR WARS will award 10 million points. You add letters by ramp\nshots, or left or right orbit shots. Hitting the left inlane rollover\nlights the orbit shots to award two letters (for a limited time).\nTHE FORCE AWARDS:\nHitting the FORCE hole while the red light above the scoop is lit will\naward a force award. You have to uncover 4 'mini' awards to light the\nforce hole for the 'super' award. The mini awards are:\n\n\nLite Yoda  This will light the C3PO lane for a Yoda award. (Described\nlater).\n\nLite Special  This will light the SPECIAL target underneath R2D2. Hit the\nright orbit shot to collect it. (Or start multiball.)\n\nSpeeder Mode  This will light the C3PO lane for Speeder Mode. Basically,\nspeeder mode is nothing but a nice animation which at the\nend awards 10 million points.\n\nSuper Laser Kick  This will allow the relaunch to stay lit for the\nremainder of the current ball. Usually, after the\nrelaunch is used, you must go to great pains to\nrelight it. This is one of the nicer awards.\n\nTRI-BALL  Will open the Death Star to start Tri-Ball.\n\n3-9 Million  Will award that number of points.\n\nCantina Mode  A scoring round where every target is worth 250,000\npoints. You start out at 5 million, and add from there.\nNOTE: Tilting will forfeit any Cantina bonus you have.\n\nMillion Pops  Each hit to a pop bumper will score a million points.\n\nX-Wing MultiMillion  A timed round where every yellow X-Wing target\nis worth 1 million points.\n\nLight Taun-Taun  This will light both outlanes to score 5 million+\npoints when a ball drains through an outlane.\n\nC3PO Eyes  This will give you a C3PO eyeball. Lighting both eyes will\nstart Runaway R2D2.\n\nHold Bonus  This will hold your bonus and multiplier over for the next\nball.\n\nWild Card  The only thing I have every gotten from this is the current\nSarlacc Pit value (see below).\n\nMax Multipliers  This will set the bonus multiplier to 8X.\n\nAT-ATs  The display will show an At-At walker coming towards the\nHoth base. Your object is to hit the pop bumpers a total\nof 20 times in a certain amount of time. Awards 20M.\n\n\nThe 'super' awards:\n\n\n25 Million  Guess what...\n\nSuper Death Star  This will starts a round where the Death Star target\nstarts at 50 million and counts down to 0 in 5 million\npoint increments. Hitting the Death Star awards the\ncurrent point value.\n\nSuper R2D2  The same as Super Death Star, except you must shoot one of\norbit shots to collect the points.\n\nReturn of\nthe Jedi  Hitting any of the lit red arrows will award 10 million points.\nThese shots include the two orbit shots and the Force hole.\n\nThe Empire  Hitting the ramp 4 times will award 30 million.\n\n\nHitting the Force hole while it is unlit will award a Dark Side shot (and the\nsound of Darth Vader breathing down your neck. Four Dark Side shots will\naward 25 million. This can be collected multiple times per ball and per game.\nSARLACC PIT:\nThe Sarlacc Pit will award the current Sarlacc Pit value. This value is\nincreased when the ball hits the pop bumpers. (The value initially starts\nat 500,000.) Hitting the left inlane rollover will light the Sarlacc Pit\nfor Jabbas Bounty (for a limited time.) This will give you various smaller\nawards such as 1,2,3 million, advance multiplier, hold bonus, etc.\nMASTER YODA:\n\"Choose wisely, you must.\" Yoda is lit by getting it as a Force award, or it\nwill sometimes light after multiple shots up the ramp. To collect Yoda, you\nmust shoot it into the C3PO eye lane. After a short intro, you will be\npresented with a choice of two \"random\" awards, selected by hitting the\nleft or right flipper. These awards range from Super Death Star, spelling\nSTARWARS, Special and 20 million. The machine I sometimes play has a VERY\nbad habit of presenting a Special as one of the awards, then not awarding\nwhen you hit the correct flipper..So be warned.\nSPEEDER MODE:\nSpeeder Mode is lit by collecting it as a Force award, or by hitting all 5\nX-Wing targets. Collect it by hitting it up the C3PO Eye lane for 10\nmillion.\nTO RELIGHT THE FORCE:\nAfter collecting a Force award, you must relight it to collect another one. This\ncan be done by hitting the C3PO eye lane, or sometimes with multiple shots\nup the ramp. You will hear \"Use the force, Luke.\" when it is relit.\nHYPERSPACE:\nKnocking down the hyperspace drop targets three times will light the ramp\nfor hyperspace. Its worth 10 million. This is also how you increase your\nbonus X. Initially lighting the ramp for hyperspace will advance the\nmultiplier to 2X. Then, up until you hit the ramp to collect the 10 million,\nevery time you knock the bank of drop targets down, the multiplier will\nbe increased up to a max of 8X. Hyperspace can be lit unlimited times in\na game (as far as I know).\nC3PO RUNAWAY:\nAfter lighting both of C3PO's eyes, you will begin R2D2 runaway. This is\na countdown shot from 15 million. To collect, hit the right orbit shot. This\ncan be restarted multiple times during a game.\nTRI-BALL AND JACKPOTS:\nBelow the Death Start, there 8 pictures of the Yaven Moon, each of various\ncolors. You will initially start with one moon lit. To advance to the next\nmoon, you must hit the Death Star. After the 8th hit, the yellow Death Star\nwill open. Hitting a ball into the Death Star will start multiball. Two balls\nwill be plunged from the auto-plunger, and one will be returned via the left\nhabitrail. To light the ramp for the Jackpot, you must again hit the\nDeath Star. After the Death Star is hit, the jackpot light will begin\nflashing above the ramp. Each hit after this initial hit will add 1\nmillion to the jackpot. (Your first jackpot starts at 10 million.) Hitting\nthe ramp will collect the jackpot. \"Bravo!\"\n\nNow, the Death Star will once again open, this time for the Double jackpot.\nYou have a limited number of seconds to hit a ball into the Death Star.\nDoing so before time runs out will reward you with a double jackpot, and\nsome decent animation of the Death Star exploding.\n\n\"Great shot kid, that was one in a million!\"\n\nYou can now start the process all over again, except this time, you will\nneed 2 hits to the death star to light the ramp for jackpot. Repeat until\n2 of 3 balls drain.\n\nNOTE: If you drain 2 balls before collecting a jackpot, you will have about\n10 seconds to get a Tri-ball restart. Simply hit the Death Star to restart.\nAlso, if the Death Star is open for double jackpot, and you drain 2/3\nballs, you will still have until your time expires to collect it.\n\nTRI-BALL PART II (or 'How to start it a little earlier than normal')\nIt is possible to open the Death Star before all the moons are lit.\nWhen the 5th Yaven moon is lit, push the plunger/lever DOWN and press\nthe lever button. This will cause the Death Star to open for a limited\namount of time, plus award you with 5 million points. You will have about\n8 seconds to start multiball doing it this way, versus unlimited time\nby hitting the Death Star 7 times.\n\nIf you aren't paying attention to the moons that are lit, or if thy are\nburned out, simple listen for \"Death Star approaching.\" When you hear\nthis, you know that you can open the Death Star.\n\nNOTE:If you open the Death Star early, and do not hit it, you start over\nat the first moon!\nVICTORY LAP:\nAfter hearing the satisfying THWACK of winning a replay, shooting either\norbit shot will award you with 25 million points. You have a limited\namount of time to do this.\nOTHER STUFF:\nIf you are lucky enough to light the extra ball, collect it with a shot\nto the C3PO lane.\n\nHitting all three drop targets within a very short time of each other will\naward 1 million points.\n\nA COMBO SHOT can be collected by hitting a ramp shot, then after the ball is\nreturned to the right flipper, hitting the left orbit shot.\n\nStorm Trooper Shoot-Out:\nLike the LW3 shootout. You must take your hands off the flippers and press\nthe lever button to waste the Storm Troopers. Awards 4M.\nPLAYING TIPS:\nHere are some general things I have picked up playing the game....\n\n\n SW is very easy to death save on. The faster the ball goes down the right\noutlane, the better.\n\n Remember that you can hit the ramp with either flipper. And the ramp is the\nis THE shot on Starwars..Awards millions, spots letters in STARWARS, awards\nthings from the force scoop, scores hyperspace, Empire, Jackpots, etc.\n\n If you have heard \"Death Star approaching\", and you drain, push down and\npress the lever button quickly to collect your 5 million points. I would\nimagine that most SW will open the Death Star for tri-ball on the 3rd\nball anyway, so get the points!\n\n The extra ball skill shot: You have to listen to the sound of the tie-\nfighter to know when to shoot. Usually firing the ball right before\nthe WHOOSH sound is the loudest will give you some success.\n\n On the second and third balls, you can very easily hit the skill shot\nby simply hitting the button before a ball is released to be launched. You\nshould hit the tie-fighter as soon as the skill shot screen appears.\n\n Relighting the kickback: A very hot thread recently on rgp. The general\nrule is to hit the drop targets, then make an orbit shot. The only\nproblem is that sometimes it takes 1 orbit shot, other times it may take\nmore, so good luck. The best thing to hope for is the Super Laser Kick\nas a force award. If the picture of the spaceship in between\nthe pop bumpers is flashing, the next orbit shot will relight the\nkickback.\n\n\"Use the force, Luke.\"  :-)\n\n\nPeople who helped in the writing of this rules sheet, by pointing out\nmistakes and suggesting new things to add:\n\n\n Deena Newman\n Jen Burch\n Kevin Martin\n Robert Deloura\n\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Star Wars", "possible_shots": "THE RAMP, THE FORCE, X-WING TARGETS, SARLACC PIT, DEATH STAR, RELAUNCH, TRI-BALL, RIGHT ORBIT SHOT, LEFT ORBIT SHOT, C3PO EYES, HYPERSPACE DROP TARGETS", "manufacturer": "Data East", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/starwars.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Star Wars", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "Star Wars: Episode I Rulesheet v0.3\nWritten by Milen (milen_cent@hotmail.com)\nStarted: Jan. 8, 2000\nUpdated: Feb. 15, 2000\n\n============\nIntroduction\n============\nI'm not a regular, or even a lurker, on the rec.games.pinball scene, but I've\nwaited and searched for so long for a rulesheet for Episode I that I figured I\nmight as well get the ball rolling (pun unintended) myself.  In a bit of a\nswitch for FAQ and rulesheet licenses, I not only don't mind if you appropriate\nthe information presented herein in your own document, I encourage it!  I merely\nask that you make some reference as to the original source.\n\nPlaying Star Wars: Episode I Pinball, a Pinball 2000 release, is a bittersweet\nexperience for me.  Sweet because it, indeed, is a fun game, powered by one of\nthe few licenses I can think of that is truly better than Addams Family (another\nof my favorite pins), and is one of the most enjoyable, fun-filled flipper games\nI've seen for a long, long time.  Bitter because, as we all know by now, it is\nthe last pinball machine to be produced by WMS Industries, meaning both the\nWilliams and Bally lines are now kaput.  I have never, ever enjoyed a pinball\nmachine that did not bear one of those two names, so this could very well be,\nfor me, a farewell to pinball, at least for modern tables.  Oh, all the more\nmelancholy that it is only the second game to use Williams' revolutionary\nPinball 2000 system!  Pinball 2000 was supposed to make pinball both more\nenjoyable to play, with the incorporation of a cunningly-placed video monitor\nthat reflects off the upper portion of the glass, and economical to maintain,\nwith a modular arrangement that would have allowed operators to switch out table\n\"cartridges\" and game software.  Alas, the only games made using this system\nhave been Ep. I and Revenge From Mars, which I have never played, the sequel to\nthe previous hit Attack From Mars.\n\nHousekeeping\n------------\nThe contents of this rulesheet are copyright 2000 by Milen.

I can only hope Pat Lawlor switches to Stern.\n\nHistory\n-------\nv0.3: Credits added, many clarifications and corrections, some grammatical\nfixes, various other things.\nv0.1: First version.\n\n================\nPlayfield Layout\n================\nFlippers\nThe standard pair, situated in the standard location.  These are the only\nflippers on the table.\n\nSlingshots\nThe standard slings, situated between the inlanes and the flippers.\n\nThe rest of the playfield, from left to right...\n\nLeft Outlane\nCan't be lit for anything.  Really, there is no light here at all.  There is a\nrubber post above the outlane/inlane dividing wall.  Outlanes seem not too be\ntoo horrible on this machine; I seem to lose most of my balls down the middle,\nbut I'm no expert.  There is rubber on the dividing post between this and the\ninlane.\n\nLeft Inlane\nAgain, apparently doesn't light for anything.  Balls sent up the left ramp end\nup here.\n\nLeft Target Bank\nA set of three targets beside a blue \"Power of the Force\" light.  Completing\nthis bank lights the left Power of the Force and awards 100,000 bonus upon end\nof ball, up to 1,000,000.  When both this and the other Power of the Force are\non they flash and unlight, awarding one bonus multiplier up to x5.\n\nLeft Orbit (C-3PO)\nLeads into the jet bumper chamber.  During most of the game, each shot to this\nlane advances the build status of C-3PO.  Eventually grants miscellaneous\nawards, starting with Extra Ball, and is used in a couple of modes.  A rollover\ntarget registers hits to this lane.  No attempt is made to judge ball direction,\nand it is not uncommon for incomplete shots to be counted twice.  Sometimes a\nball will come out of the jet bumpers through the left orbit, and these also\naward the shot.\n\nLeft Saucer (Watto's Junk Shop)\nOne of two real, honest-to-goodness ball locks.  When the associated light is\nflashing, these holes each lock a ball towards multiball.  At that time the game\nalso grants a random award.  The hole is small; a direct (I mean DIRECT) shot to\nthis hole will have its impact absorbed by a fixed ball behind the saucer, but\nthis is rare.  Usually balls end up here because they've been drifting around\nthe upper reaches of the board.  This is the second hardest shot in the game.\nA side note: depending on how level your machine is, balls ejected from here\nhave a nasty tendency to head right between the flippers.\n\nLeft Ramp\nUsed in many of the modes, and for combos.  Is a Jackpot shot during Multiball.\nThe entrance to this ramp is almost always hidden by the image from the video\nscreen reflected off the glass, but the player is clued in on its location by\nimages on the display.  When no mode is running this image is a \"virtual\nspinner\" that awards a small number of points whenever a ball reaches the ramp\nentrance.  Unlike a real spinner, this always spins the same number of times\nregardless of how hard the ball was hit.  During mode play, if the ramps are\nimportant shots there is usually an image on the display that clues the player\nin on their location.  Note that in many cases a complete ramp shot is not\nnecessary to score a hit on that ramp; any ball touching the entrance counts as\na hit target.  Cases where complete ramp shots are required are mentioned in the\nmode descriptions, below.  And last, there is a drop target at the entrance to\nthis ramp, also hidden by the display.  A few modes use this to block entrance\nto the ramp, giving the amusing impression that the ball bounced off some object\non the screen -- amusing right up until the player is caught off-guard and loses\na ball by this action.  Then \"amusing\" becomes \"annoying.\"\n\nLeft (Side) Center Target\nAnother shot that is mostly hidden by the video screen.  This is angled slightly\nto the right, so shots that hit this target don't tend to drain as often as\ncenter shots on, say, Attack From Mars.  This is used in lots of modes.  Many\ntimes modes that require you to hit a ramp or the center retractable target will\nalso count hits to the closest \"Side Center Target.\"\n\nCenter Retractable Target\nIn approximately the same place as the center standup array in Attack From Mars\ncomes the return of the All-Important Drain Shot.  Easily the most important\nshot in the game.  If the retractable target is down then good shots to this\narea between the Side Targets fall into a hole, and are returned to the player\nat an inlane.  If it's not down, however, the ball bounces off, very often\nStraight Down The Middle.  This shot is often important no matter what the state\nof the target.  But even worse!  Unlike AFM, this target is completely obscured\nby the video display.  It is so obscured that I STILL am not quite sure how this\ntarget physically works.  One of the important steps towards getting good at\nthis game is to memorize the behavior of this target, so you'll know what to\nexpect at any given time.\n\nVideo screen\nThe central gimmick to Pinball 2000, and a seriously cool part of the game.\nClips from the movie show at the start of different modes, the part of the\nscreen that overlaps the playfield targets shows little icons to help you aim\nyour shot, characters rise up and taunt you or get abused by the ball, and all\nsorts of other goodness.\n\nRight (Side) Center Target\nThe table is so symmetrical that most of the elements on the left side of the\nboard have identical counterparts on the right side.  Go see the description for\nthe Left Center Target.\n\nRight Ramp\nServes most of the same purposes, at most of the same times, as the left ramp,\nwith two important exceptions: the return off the right ramp is where the ball\ngets sent after a missed skill shot, and after spelling GUNGAN in the jet\nbumpers, this ramp starts granting letters in JAR JAR.  Other than that,\nbasically identical.\n\nRight Saucer (Mos Espa)\nNamed differently from and gives you a different animation than the Left Saucer\n(Watto's Junk Shop), but pretty much the same thing.  Oh, except instead of a\nfixed ball, a couple of rubber deflectors, bracketing the saucer and angled\ndownward, are the means chosen to absorb the ball's momentum.  This is even\nworse than the fixed ball, and makes this the hardest shot on the board.\n\nJet Bumpers\nThe jet chamber has openings to the playfield below (shots are made from the\nleft flipper) and to the left orbit in the back.  Awards miscellaneous points.\nThe jets seem to almost be merely a place to put the ball for a while in this\ngame, except that sometimes a ball comes out of the jets headed for the flippers\nat high speed.  After this happens a couple of times you learn to respect the\njets.\n\nFlythrough Lane\nAbout the only things this lane seems to be used for are Skill Shots and Extra\nBalls.  It is murder to hit this lane from the flippers; usually the ball just\ndrifts there, most commonly when coming out of the jet chamber.  Very nicely,\nthe Skill Shot collects any Extra Ball that happens to be lit.\n\nSith Droid Magnet\nA magnet under the table, corresponding in position to a drawing of a \"Sith\nDroid\" in the artwork.  Turns on for a couple of seconds whenever the Right\nTarget Bank is hit.\n\nRight Target Bank\nThese targets have their own \"Power of the Force\" light, maintaining symmetry\nwith the bank on the left side of the table.  These also turn on the Sith Droid\nmagnet for a couple of seconds.\n\nRight Inlane\nPractically nothing.  The ball is returned here after going up the right ramp.\n\nRight Outlane\nPractically nothing.  Just wave goodbye to the ball.  There is rubber on the\ndividing posts between the outlane and inlane.\n\nPlunger and Skill Shot\nThe skill shot is a simple hole in the assembly coming up off a manual plunger.\nThe hole leads to the Flythrough Lane, and this will collect an Extra Ball if\none is lit there.\n\nPlayfield Notes\nThis table is almost as symmetrical as Attack From Mars.  A nice, uncluttered\ndesign.  Star Wars: Episode One is not the most complicated pin game in the\nworld, but I kind of prefer that.\n\n==========\nObjectives\n==========\nThe objective of the game is to become a great and powerful Jedi by collecting,\num, letters in the word JEDI.  I'm sure Yoda worked his way to the top in\nexactly the same fashion.  The primary method in which you earn letters is by\ncompleting modes, a.k.a. scenes.  After every mode, regardless of how well you\ndid, you get one of those all-important letters.  Every time you spell JEDI, the\nCenter Retractable Target goes down, and by hitting it you get to play Saber\nBattle against Darth Maul.  This is explained below.  After winning this (I\nreally don't know what happens when you fail, it's THAT easy), you advance one\nJedi Rank, first to Jedi Youth, then Jedi Knight, Jedi Master and Jedi Spirit.\nWhat happens when you reach Spirit?  I don't know!  I'm still working on that.\nI've yet to hear of anyone, myself included, reaching Master.  My record is\nthree letters past Jedi Knight.  Can anyone enlighten me as to what happens\nlater on?\n\nJedi letters can also be earned:\n- The second time you Build C-3PO,\n- after making three Skill Shots, only once per game,\n- as one of the potential awards in Jedi Musical Chairs,\n- and sometimes a Jedi Letter is granted as the random award after a ball lock.\n\nThe Projector\n-------------\nAt the start of a new game, the main, retractable center target is down.  One\nhit to this (whether it catches and is sent to an inlane or whether it falls\nout) activates the Projector, which then displays a large image on the video\ndisplay representing one of the thirteen modes in the game.  This image can be\nchanged to one of about seven different possibilities using the Action Buttons\n(small crescent-shaped buttons wrapped part way around the main flipper buttons\non the sides of the machine).  The center target remains down, and a solid hit\n(this time it's required that the ball catch) begins the mode represented by the\nimage on the projector, kicking off with a short video clip.  Modes DO NOT END\nwith the ball; they continue, during your turn in a multiplayer game, until\ncomplete or the game ends.  Even if you manage to finish JEDI through other\nmeans, you cannot start Saber Battle until the mode is done.  (Amendment: if the\nletter is awarded as one of the random awards in Jedi Musical Chairs, I've seen\nthe game end the scene immediately.)  Scoring for each mode is different, but\nupon completion you always earn at least one million points.  Some modes award\nperfect shooting, meaning not hitting major targets that do not advance your\nstanding in the mode, with three million instead, but such flawless play has no\nother reward.  If you lose a ball during a mode, it does NOT count against you\nfor the \"Perfect Shooting\" award.  Modes known to award the \"Perfect Shooting\"\nbonus are: Destroyer Droids, Sith Droids, Ground Battle, and Space Battle.\nUsing the lasers in Space Battle also doesn't count against you.  (Unless you\nmiss with a laser?  Unknown.)\n\nThe first mode only requires one shot to start.  Subsequent modes require three\nhits to activate the projector; the retracting target only opens for a safe shot\nfor the third hit.  Then a solid fourth hit to the center starts the next mode.\nIt seems that up until the player reaches Jedi Youth, both the center target and\nthe targets to either side count as hits to the projector.  After Darth Maul has\nbeen battled the first time, this behavior changes so that only center shots\ncount.\n\nWhen a mode is completed, it is removed from the modes available on the\nProjector and replaced with another from those not yet played.  When all the\nmodes are introduced no others are added, limiting your choices.  I do not know\nwhat happens when all the modes are exhausted, or if this behavior changes.  The\ngame seems set on making sure you play all modes once before giving you any\nmore.\n\n=====================\nModes (a.k.a. Scenes)\n=====================\n\nRELATIVELY SIMPLE MODES:\n\nSub Escape\nProjector Image: Submarine\nVideo Display: An underwater scene in which our heroes, in their submarine, are\nchased by a sea creature.\nThis is the easiest mode in the game.  On the left side of the screen is a\nprogress bar, usually starting at around half-full.  Making ANY of the main\nshots, being ramps, the big retractable center target or the smaller targets\nwhich bracket it grants progress on the bar.  The ramps are definitely the best\nthings to aim for in this mode, since a complete ramp shot maintains control of\nthe ball, but incomplete ramp shots still grant progress towards finishing the\nmode.  If this mode lasts for a while, the progress bar will begin to empty.\nI've never seen this bar run out.  If you lose a ball, the bar will remain\nstable until a playfield switch is hit, usually from the Flythrough Lane (after\na successful skill shot) or the Right Inlane (if the shot was failed).  As a\nside note, all game timers seem to freeze when a ball is waiting to be plunged\n(except after the first ball of Saber Battle).  On the other hand, no game timer\nwill wait just because a ball is in the jet bumpers.\nThe Episode I Pinball website seems to indicate that shots to the lanes will\nadvance the progress bar in this mode.  If this is true I haven't noticed it.\n\nGround Battle\nProjector Image: Ordinary Trooper-Droid\nDisplay: A peaceful forest scene on Naboo which a troop carrier spoils by\nlittering with droids.\nThis mode would go under the \"Hit-Lots-Of-Targets Modes\" section if it weren't\nfor the simple fact that you don't actually HAVE to hit those targets.  The\ndroids are worth points and can be shot with the lasers, but it is by no means\nessential that you do so.  This is one of those modes which uses the drop\ntargets in front of the ramps; whenever a droid is on the ground in this scene,\nthe corresponding drop target under the droid image is up.  You can lower those\ntargets by hitting them, in which case they remain down until they are replaced\nby the carrier, or by shooting them with the lasers.  Getting rid of those\ndroids allows you to hit the droids in the air behind them (with complete ramp\nshots), worth some funky bonuses such as \"Super-Dooper Secret STAPP Bonus.\"\nGee, thanks.  All this is a distraction from the actual goal of the scene, which\nis basically to shoot the center retractable target three times.  After two hits\nthe target retracts, making for a safer final shot.\n\nR2-D2 Astrodroid\nProjector Image: Our Favorite Ambulatory Garbage Can\nDisplay: The astrodroid bay on the Queen's ship, with the doomed robots solemnly\nawaiting their fate outside the doorway of their destruction.\nThis can be one of the higher scoring modes.  This scene is basically a series\nof six consecutive hurry-up shots.  Each shot is made by hitting either the\ncenter retractable target or either of the side targets.  The side targets tend\nto be hit a lot just from the ball roaming the board, so this tends not to be\nsuch a difficult scene.  If you only want to do is finish the scene, all you\nhave to do is hit these targets six times, with each shot sending a droid\nthrough the doorway.  A point total starts at 500,000 points, which after a\nbrief grace period begins to rapidly count down to 50,000, remaining there until\nyou collect the shot.  While the total is counting down, complete ramp shots\nreset the timer to its base value plus 100,000, with no known limit.  If you're\ngood at the alternating-ramps combo you can get a fair number of points here,\nfrom combo scoring and hurry-up bonuses.  Missed ramps tend to collect the shot,\nthough.  Hitting a ramp when the value is at 50,000 does nothing.  After a shot\nis collected the next droid's value resets to 500,000.\nThis mode is not in the initial rotation of scenes at the start of a game.  It\nseems to be the first of the scenes that are added to the mix as you start\nfinishing scenes.\n\nMOVING TARGET MODES:\n\nSith Droids\nProjector Image: Pistol\nDisplay: Amidala shooting probe droids on Tatooine.\nA pistol icon appears on the screen, moving back and forth.  The idea is to hit\nthe target the icon is over, at the instant the icon is over it.  Since the\ndifferent targets that register hits in this scene (ramps, side-center targets\nand the big center retractable target) are of different sizes, you can sometimes\nbe fairly far off with your aim and still get credit for a hit.  As in many\nmodes, a complete ramp shot is not necessary to score a hit to the pistol; all\nthat is required is that the ball reaches the entrance to the ramp.  Three hits\nis what you need to finish the mode.  If all your shots during this mode hit the\nicon, you get three million for \"Perfect Shooting\" after this scene instead of\nthe usual one million.\n\nGungan Battle\nProjector Image: Weird-looking Hovertank\nDisplay: The fields of Naboo, with the tanks coming over the hill.\nThis is basically the Sith Droids mode reprised, with different graphics, a\nfaster target and with six shots to make instead of three.\nThis is not among the scenes in the initial rotation.\n\nDestroyer Droids\nProjector Image: \"Destroyer\" Droid\nDisplay: Inside the Queen's Palace on Naboo\nTo paraphrase myself: This is basically the Gungan Battle mode reprised, with\ndifferent graphics and an even faster, very erratically-moving target.  The\nmovement of the target, surprisingly, sometimes makes the mode easier, since the\ncenter shot becomes a safer bet.\nThis mode isn't selectable when the game begins.\n\nWatto's Chance\nProjector Image: The Schnozz Himself\nDisplay: Watto in his shop hovering over three \"chance cubes.\"\nThis scene is a breeze compared to the other moving target scenes.  Watto slowly\nmoves from cube to cube, and all you have to do is hit the cube he's over.\nShots to the side cubes are registered for completed ramp shots; you have to hit\nthe center target (not retracted) to count as a hit on the middle cube.\nThis scene cannot be selected at the start of the game.\n\nHIT-LOTS-OF-TARGETS MODES:\n\nSpace Battle\nProjector Image: Enemy Spaceship\nDisplay: The cockpit of Anakin's ship, looking out into space.\nThis is my favorite mode in the game, and one of the few modes that lasers are\nbasically there for.  Spaceships fill the screen, over the ramps and the center\ntarget.  Ships on the sides can be hit with laser fire or incomplete ramp shots.\n(Craft higher up on the screen require completed ramps.)  The drop targets in\nfront of the ramps are up whenever ships hug the bottom of the screen; hitting\nthem with the ball or laser fire will clear them.  Ships in the center can be\nhit with shots to any of the three center targets.  The jets are a good place\nfor the ball during this mode, so you can spend some time picking off targets\nwith the lasers.  When you make a shot or fire the laser the remaining ships\nscatter around the screen.  They also periodically move around on their own.\nOnce they're all destroyed the center target retracts, allowing a safe shot to\ndestroy the control ship and end the mode.\n\nHangar Escape\nProjector Image: Anakin's spacecraft from the movie\nDisplay: The hangar of the control ship.\nAnother good laser mode.  This one works a lot like Space Battle, in that shots\nto the center and the ramps make the mode.  The drop targets don't rise for this\nmode, however.  I'm unsure whether you need complete ramp shots to hit droids on\nthe side; I always pick them off using laser fire.  I've noticed that the first\ndroid in the scene ALWAYS appears in the center, and no other droids show up\nuntil it has been destroyed.  When droids show up in this mode, they are\ndepicted as walking in from the background.  Until they stop walking, they\ncannot be harmed; ramp shots have no effect on them, and lasers are just wasted.\nOnce in position, the droids don't move from shot to shot like the fighters in\nSpace Battle.  Once all the droids are rubble, a final shot to the (now\nretracted) center finishes the mode.\n\nCOMPLICATED MODES:\n\nPodracing\nProjector Image: Podracer\nDisplay: The most visually active mode of them all, racing your podracer over\nTatooine in a scene very reminiscent of the Nintendo 64 Podracing game.\nThree icons appear on the display, one over each major shot (ramps and center).\nBeginning to pick up on a pattern?  All the center targets count as the same\nshot, and incomplete ramps work just as well as solid hits.  The object is to\nhit the \"checkpoint\" icons, which have a checkered flag on them.  You can affect\nthe scene for points and fun by hitting the other icons, in order to steer and\nspeed up.  The game tells you what place you're in overall and keeps you up to\ndate on your current speed, but I don't know of any real purpose for these\nvalues.  The icons themselves appear to be randomly selected, and change when\nthey are hit.  Sometimes you end up with no checkpoints to choose from, and you\nhave to make shots to make them appear.  Three checkpoint shots is enough to win\nthe race and finish the mode.\n\nQueen's Game\nProjector Image: Queen Amidala's Seal\nDisplay: Queen Amidala's Throne Room\nThis is perhaps the most difficult mode.  I like to refer to this one as the\n\"Queen Amidala Dress-up Round.\"  Queenie stands in the middle of the scene,\nbefore a big wheel holding six blank panels.  Two of these panels are situated\nover the ramps.  Shots to the ramps (or the adjacent center targets) flip over\ntheir corresponding panels.  Shots do not have to travel up the entire ramp.\nShots to the center and the laser buttons spin the wheel.  The game usually\nseems to give you at least one uncovered panel each spin.  Uncover all six\npanels to finish the mode.\nYou can't play this mode at the start of the game.\n\nRANDOM AWARD MODES:\n\nJedi Musical Chairs\nProjector Image: Yoda, ensconced in comfy seating\nDisplay: The Jedi Council Chamber\nFive Jedi Council members sit before you on the screen, each with their own\naward (no duplicates among those offered) while the music plays.  At this time\nthe ramps and center targets randomly mix up the council, usually so a different\none is in the middle.  At a randomly-determined time, all the Jedi except the\none centered goes dim, with the one above the center target remaining lit on a\n20-second timer.  The jet bumpers do not pause this timer.  Hitting the center\nshot (the two side targets don't count) collects that Jedi and his award.  If\nthe timer runs out or the ball drains then that award is removed uncollected.\nEither way, the music then restarts with the remaining members.  The mode\ncontinues until three awards have been collected.  The awards range from 1,000\nto 2,000,000 points.  Occasionally other awards crop up too, most often Advance\nBonus Multiplier, Hold Bonus and (!) Add Jedi Letter.  In my opinion, Add Jedi\nLetter is the sole interesting thing about this mode.  (I have come across one\nbug in this round; see Bugs, at the end of this document.)\n\nJar Jar Juggling\nProjector Image: Jar Jar Binks, He Who Must Be Destroyed\nDisplay: The Jarster, balancing (and then, not balancing) junk in Watto's shop\nJar Jar Binks appears on the display, balancing junk in that special way in\nwhich Jar Jar Binks balances junk.  Below appears the message \"Trip Jar Jar!\"\nDare I DREAM?  A hit to the center target knocks Mr. Comic Relief to the floor,\nalong with the five pieces of junk, which conveniently scatters one piece above\neach ramp and center target.  Collect the junk and an associated award by\nhitting that shot; three shots ends the mode.  Very entertainingly, you can\ncontinue to trip Jar Jar even after scattering the junk.  The value of each\naward is not revealed to the player, but is consistent with each type of junk.\nThe pieces that glow green, for example, are worth 2,000,000.  Look out for the\npinball with the golden aura!  This rare piece of junk lights extra ball when\ncollected.\n\n==============\nOther Features\n==============\n\nSkill Shot\n----------\nThe manual plunger feeds the plastic habitrail coming down from the right ramp\nto the right inlane.  A strong shot will overshoot a small hole in the plastic\nleading to the Flythrough Lane.  Hitting the ball just strong enough to go\nthrough this hole earns 1,000,000 the first time, 2,000,000 the second time and\nthen 3,000,000 plus a Jedi Letter.  From then on it just scores 3,000,000\npoints.  This is nothing to sneeze at -- you get a chance at the skill shot at\nthe start of each ball, after every lock for Multiball and both before AND after\nSaber Battle.  Basically, every plunged ball except those in the middle of Saber\nBatter can be worth a skill shot.  Assuming six balls in most games (not an\nunfair assumption on standard settings), one multiball and one Saber Battle,\nthat's nine Skill Shots right there, worth 24 million plus a free Jedi Letter.\nThis game tends to score low, lower than Addams Family (but not nearly so low as\nsome recent machines) so these points are nothing to ignore.  Plus, the skill\nshot collects lit extra balls.\n\nBuild C-3PO\n-----------\nShots to the left orbit award pieces of C-3PO.  The lights on the orbit show you\nhow close you are to finishing him; solidly-lit components are already\ncollected, and the flashing component shows what part will be awarded next.  On\nstandard settings, he begins the game half-completed.  When he's finished, the\nplayer earns the next award on the list:\n\nLight Extra Ball\nAdd Jedi Letter\n2,000,000 Points\nHold Bonus\n\nThere could be more awards, but I don't yet know what they are.\n\nGUNGAN and JAR JAR\n------------------\nWhile in normal play, an image of seaweed and bubbles appears on the display\naround the place the bumpers are located.  During normal play only, getting the\nball to the jet bumpers awards one letter in GUNGAN.  Usually you only get one\nletter per trip to the bumpers, but if the ball somehow doesn't trip any bumper\nfor a couple of seconds, the game will assume the ball left and returned and\nwill award an additional letter.  Spelling GUNGAN replaces the seaweed with Jar\nJar Binks, and now hitting the bumpers causes him to feel arbitrary, sourceless\npain and suffering.  This is basically Super Jets (though I haven't noticed the\nscoring).  Furthermore, you'll notice that now the \"Star Wars\" virtual spinner\nover the right ramp has changed appearance.  Hitting that ramp now awards\nletters in JAR JAR.  I don't know what this is for; does anyone know the purpose\nfor this?\nGUNGAN and JAR JAR can only be worked towards during normal play.  Modes,\nMultiball and Saber Battle each prevent further progress from being made.  Since\nthe primary objective of the game is to earn Jedi status, which basically hinges\non having modes running at every possible moment, we don't see much progress\nmade towards these goals.  Worst of all, each ball resets all progress made.\n\nRamps\n-----\nIn addition to JAR JAR, hitting a ramp, either with a strong hit or with weak\nshots that don't complete the entire ramp, spins the \"virtual spinner\" at the\nbase of the ramp.  This is worth 10,000 the first time, then 20,000, 30,000,\n40,000, etc., up to 100,000, not resetting until a moderate amount of time goes\nby without a ball entering a ramp.  These points are only awarded during normal\nplay, when no mode is running.\n\nCombos\n------\nThe only known combo in the game is alternating ramps.  At any time except\nduring Saber Battle, making consecutive ramp shots starts building on a combo.\nUpon missing a ramp shot, if you manage to quickly regain control of the ball\nand then hit EITHER ramp, the combo can be continued.  It doesn't matter if\nother switches are triggered.  The scoring starts for 200,000 for a two-way\ncombo, and then increases by 100,000 for each additional ramp shot made with no\nknown limit.  (However, I haven't been able to test many limits.  Whatever it\nis, it's certainly over a million.)  The player with the longest Ramp Combo gets\nto post his initials as the Combo Champion at the end of the game.\nCombos do count normally during multiball.  Combos are detected during Saber\nBattle, but there have a different, special purpose; see the corresponding\nsection.\n\nWatto's Junk Shop & Mos Espa\n----------------------------\nGames start with both of these saucers flashing.  Hitting one earns a pseudo-\nrandom award from the following list:\n\n500,000\n1,000,000\nActivate Projector\nAdvance C-3PO\nFive Lasers\nTen Lasers\nIncrease Bonus\nAdd Bonus Multiplier\nHold Bonus\nAward Jedi Letter\nLight Extra Ball\n\nFor Mos Espa the award is selected from a list of four; for Watto the award is\njust granted.  Light Extra Ball seems to come up a bit more often when the\nplayer has had a poor game, but I could be wrong.  (This also seems true of the\nextra ball in Jar Jar Juggling.)  I've only seen Activate Projector be selected\nwhen no mode is running and the Projector is not yet active.  After the award\nthe ball is left in the saucer and another ball is served; the holes serve as\nthe ball locks.  The game's web site says that locks can be stolen from other\nplayers in a multiplayer game, but the only machine on which I've been able to\nobserve multiplayer games uses a form of software compensation to handle stolen\nlocks.  The rule is, if you lock your first ball when the other saucer already\ncontains a ball, then that other ball will be ejected into play.  This means\nthat, if a previous player locks a ball before you, you can only lock your first\nball in the remaining saucer, making it a bit more difficult to get into\nMultiball.  I don't know what happens when a player locks a ball, then a later\nplayer starts Multiball, unlocking all balls and leaving the first player with a\nbit of a problem.\n\nAfter the first Multiball, both the saucers are unlit.  The first ball to land\nin one of these holes relights the holes for ball locks and random awards and is\nthen ejected.  Each subsequent Multiball then requires one additional saucer hit\nbefore the game again begins to start locking balls and giving awards.  On the\nmachine I've played the most, Watto's Junk Shop has a nasty habit of ejecting\nballs that head right for the center drain.  This can be a serious problem if it\nhappens consistently.\n\nBalls can be locked and saucer hits earned during any normal mode, but don't\ncount during Saber Battle or (understandably) Multiball.  At these times balls\nlanding in saucers are simply ejected.\n\nMultiball\n---------\nMultiball is remarkably difficult to start on purpose on this machine.  Not\nquite as bad as, say, Twilight Zone but still very annoying.  It is possible to\nintentionally lock balls, but your aim has to be spot on, especially for Mos\nEspa, which likes to rebound misses towards the drain.  Much more often balls\ndrifting around the upper portion of the board will just sort of fall into the\nlocks, or you'll accidentally lock balls that were intended for C-3PO or the\njets.  If you *can* intentionally lock balls, however, then the high score table\njust opens up before you, because Multiball is so incredibly high scoring.\nAfter a remarkably invigorating start quote (often either Jar Jar or Anakin\nshouting \"MULTIBALL!!\"), a ball is served to the plunger.  You can earn a skill\nshot on this.  After the ball trips a playfield switch, the two locked balls are\nejected from their saucers and glorious mayhem ensues.  Any mode running before\nmultiball continues to run.  Sometimes if you're in a particularly difficult\nmode it can be a valid strategy to start Multiball, because all the balls\nflailing across the board tends to make quick work of most scenes.  After the\nscene ends, the Projector does not reappear until Multiball is over, and no new\nmodes can be started.\n\nRegardless of the currently running mode, the game overlays a big Jackpot icon\nover the center targets.  Hitting either the big center retractable target\n(which is closed in this mode) or either of the targets to either side earns a\nJackpot, at one million points, and the collected Jackpot is removed from the\nboard.  Then, a Jackpot appears on each of the ramps.  Each of these are also\nworth one million, and a ball needn't make it all the way up the ramp to\ncollect.  After those are scored all three Jackpots return at once.  The first\ntwo are worth one million, but the last earns a Super Jackpot of five million.\nThen the cycle repeats until Multiball ends.  It's that simple, and just making\nit through one cycle is worth ten million.  I often last for three cycles; 30\nMillion is a fairly decent award for this game.  Remember, on default settings\nextra balls are awarded at 20 million and 60 million points.  C-3PO is still\nactive during Multiball, but no GUNGAN or JAR JAR letters seem to be awarded\nregardless of whether a mode is running at the time.\n\nIf two of the three balls drain before even a single Jackpot is scored, the game\nbegins a brief Multiball Restart timer, about 15 seconds if I remember\ncorrectly.  Hitting any saucer (the center retractable target, which will be\nopen now, counts) serves one additional ball and allows Multiball to continue.\n\nGetting huge scores during Multiball is not at all difficult, and is really the\nonly likely way a score can break out into the stratosphere without slogging\nthrough the modes.  Multiball is also just plain out FUN, with Jar Jar and\nAnakin shouting out encouragement and complements almost every other second, and\ngoing nuts whenever a Jackpot, and especially a Super Jackpot, is collected.\nThe music is also G-R-E-A-T and really serves to add an air of urgency to your\nefforts.\n\nBonus\n-----\nBonus appears to be of two primary types, individual bonus count units worth\n100,000, signified by lit sections of Anakin's spaceship on the playfield, and\nmultipliers.  The un-multiplied bonus can reach up to 1,000,000, and with a x5\nMultiplier can get as high as 5,000,000, not so bad for this game.  Best of all,\nI would say the entire point to the bonus count on this game, the bonus music\nchanges if you manage to reach 5,000,000, becoming a great John Williams-esque\nfanfare with matching lightshow.  Great stuff!  Your current Jedi status is also\nreported during the bonus count.  Each player, instead of \"Player One\" or\n\"Player Two,\" is given the name of one of the Episode One characters, and this\nis also presented at this time along with a video clip.\n\nSaber Battle\n------------\nInstead of one big wizard mode the end of the game (presumably -- I don't know\nif there is a big wizard waiting or not, I've not gotten that far yet), you\ninstead earn several \"little\" wizard modes throughout.  This is a great idea,\none I hope Stern Pinball picks up on.  (That, and hopefully they'll also start\nmaking some good games.)  The game basically allows players to choose a goal\nappropriate to their skill.  Even novice players have a chance of making it to\nthe first Saber Battle, while reaching Jedi Spirit should provide a good\nchallenge even for wizards.\n\nWhen Jedi is spelled and no mode is running, the image of the Projector is\nreplaced with that of a lightsaber hilt.  If the locks are flashing they stop;\nMultiball cannot be started at this time.  The center target retracts, and a\ngood solid hit that catches is required to begin Saber Battle.\n\nAfter a video clip, a second ball is served to the plunger.  A skill shot can be\nmade on this ball alone.  The battle doesn't properly begin until the ball\nenters play, usually detected at the Flythrough Lane or the Right Inlane.  At\nthat time the first ball is released back into play at an inlane.  Soon after a\nthird ball is served to the plunger, but this can be ignored if you wish.\n\nSaber Battle is basically a direct fight against Darth Maul.  Qui-Gon Jinn\nstands on the left side of the video display and Maul stands on the right.  At\nthe top of the screen the score disappears, replaced by energy meters for both\nQui-Gon and Maul.  Making major shots does damage to the Sith Lord's energy\nmeter.  Ramp shots appear to only count if they make it completely up the ramp.\nI'm not sure, but I think the side center targets do not count in this mode,\nthough it seems that C-3PO's orbit DOES count.  The alternating ramps combo does\nadditional damage.  If too much time passes without making a shot Maul does a\nhit of damage to Qui-Gon's energy bar.  All lost balls are automatically\nreturned to the plunger after a short delay, but since it's a manual plunger\nyou'll have to take your hand off the flipper in order to launch the ball.  It\ngenerally is best to have as many balls in play as you can; you may want to\nenlist the aid of a friend to sit there and plunge balls as they are returned.\nAfter Darth Maul's energy is completely depleted he emits a hideous wail and the\nflippers lock, allowing all balls to drain.  You get five million points for\ndefeating Darth Maul, you earn one Jedi Rank, one ball is returned and the\nProjector reappears, allowing you to try spelling Jedi once more.  So what\nhappens when your energy bar runs out?  That's the thing -- Saber Battle is\nreally so easy that I've never lost.  A couple of times I've been taken down to\none energy unit left, but even more often I've not lost any energy at all.  I\ndon't know if there's an award like \"Perfect Shooting\" for not losing any balls\nduring Saber Battle; so far I've always lost at least one.\n\nExtra Balls and Replays\n-----------------------\n\nThere are basically three guaranteed extra balls in the game:\nBuild C-3PO (first time)\nReach 20,000,000 points (probably operator adjustable)\nReach 60,000,000 points (also probably adjustable)\n\nMost good games easily achieve all three extra balls.  Sometimes I refer to it\nas a \"six ball game\" because of this.  Sometimes lit extra balls crop up as a\nrandom award, or as one of the pieces of junk in Jar Jar Juggling, but these\ncannot be relied upon.  I've heard one player say he got a lit extra ball from\nspelling GUNGAN, but I've spelled GUNGAN before and didn't get it.  Maybe if you\nspell JAR JAR?\n\nBy default the game is not set up to award replays, not even for high scores or\nGrand Champion, which is really too bad.  No buy-ins are allowed.  Free games\n*are* awarded on a match.\n\nAction Buttons\n--------------\nThe Pinball 2000 action buttons are used to fire lasers during some modes.\nThere is a total number of lasers that accumulates throughout the game, shown in\nthe upper-right-hand corner of the display.  You begin with ten, and\nmiscellaneous targets and random awards can add to that.  In general, you aren't\ngoing to run out of lasers unless you shamelessly overuse them.  As long as\nthey're used intelligently and only at times when they're of some value you\nshould always have enough.  Lasers make short work of two or three of the modes,\nso it's best to use them whenever they're good for something.\n\nWhen a mode is not running but the Projector is active, the action buttons flip\nthrough the available modes.\n\nVanity Boards\n-------------\nThere sure are a lot of these!  In addition to the standard Grand Champion plus\nfour scoreboard, there's a Ramp Combo champ besides, and one ten-entry board for\neach level of Jedi mastery!  This basically collects the initials of the last\nten players to reach each level.  On our machine, the top name on the Jedi Youth\nlist scrolls completely out daily and sometimes even faster, but Jedi Knight\ntakes a few days.  No one has managed to register on the Jedi Master board.\n\nTournament Mode\n---------------\nDuring attract mode, insert a credit then hold both flipper buttons for a couple\nof seconds.  Eventually a box will say you can start Tournament mode by pressing\nStart within ten seconds.  I've not seen any differences in Tournament mode, but\nprobably the random awards are derandomized.\n\nBugs\n----\nSometimes hits to the C3PO target orbit trigger the rollover so quickly that\ncredit isn't given.  This is moderately annoying, especially when you're one\nshot from Light Extra Ball.\nI've only seen this once, under version v1.3 of the software: sometimes when\nscrambling up the Jedi Council during Jedi Musical Chairs, after already\ncollecting at least one member right when the music stops things will go a\nlittle nuts, and you'll end up without a lit council member.  The mode still\ntries to continue.  The display, instead of saying \"Collect Yoda,\" \"Collect Mace\nWindu,\" etc. says \"Collect Member.\"  The timer continues to progress normally.\nIn my case hitting the center shot collected 10,000 points, which could have\nbeen the value of the (invisible, previously collected) member.  The timer\ndoesn't reset, and no member is removed.  The shot remains active.  When the\ntimer runs out it sticks at '00' and the mode doesn't end.  I could continue to\nhit it for 10,000 a pop.  The game is basically stuck.  Losing a ball seems to\nfix the problem, unsticking the round.  It is unknown if this bug can be\nexploited to gain unlimited Jedi Letters.\n\nCows\n----\nNone spotted yet.\n\nStrategy\n--------\nThere appear to be basically two ways to get lots of points:\n\n- Multiball.  This is the quick, high-risk method.  Dangerous to start, but\nlucrative once underway.  30M is really not too much to ask, even when just\nflailing at balls.  I shudder to think of how much a true wizard could make on\nthis thing.\n\n- Collect Jedi Letters, play modes and work towards Saber Battles.  This is the\nlong-term method.  If you just work towards finishing modes, you'll have about\n45-50M by the end of the first Saber Battle, and around 90-100M after the\nsecond.\n\nRegardless of your focus, you *always* want to have a mode running.  Modes\ngenerally mean more points, and even if you don't try to fill any of the scene's\nrequirements it will eventually finish anyway just from random motion of the\nball.  Every mode out of the way means one step closer to Saber Battle, which is\nbasically a bunch of almost risk-free points.\n\nThe skill shot may not seem like much, but it adds up.  I usually hit the\nplunger with the flat of my hand instead of pulling back and letting go.  This\nway I get the skill shot at least 80% of the time.  Three skill shots means a\nfree Jedi letter, and most of the time you'll be getting three million per shot.\nRemember, that first extra ball is at a paltry 20 mil.\n\nThe Ramp Combo can be worth something as well, if you can keep it up for more\nthan ten shots.  After the tenth shot the combo has earned a total of 7.4\nmillion, and the value just keeps increasing as long as you keep it up.\n\nExtra balls are plentiful, up to the third, at which point the only remaining\nsources are random.  It might be worthwhile to put off Jar Jar Juggling, despite\nits obvious appeal, until balls are getting scarce in an attempt to elicit the\ngame's pity.\n\nIt may be only me, but it seems that the modes themselves somehow get more\ndifficult as you progress.  This may just be because the modes that ask more of\nthe player don't show up in the initial rotation, but I think some ask you to\nmake more shots as the game continues.  I think I caught shots during Sub\nEscape, for example, giving you less credit later in the game.  I will bow to\nmore informed opinions.\n\nScoring\n-------\nThe game scores interestingly, since there are far fewer \"giveaway\" points than\nin most other pinball machines.  Except for Multiball, there is no really huge\naward on this machine.  Even winning a Saber Battle is worth only five million.\nThis machine makes you earn each and every point.  The local Grand Champion\nscore (keep in mind that this is not what I'd call a pinball town) is 189M.  My\nhighest score to date is nipping on its heels at 180M.  Since extra balls are\nawarded at fairly low scores, high scores tend to get that much higher.\n\nAppeal\n------\nThis really seems to be one of the best pinball licenses I've seen, even better\nthan Adams Family despite the lack of quotes from cast members.  (They only got\nJar Jar and Anakin doing new dialogue for the game.)  While this game won't make\nme forget my favorite machines (Attack From Mars and anything by Pat Lawlor), it\ndefinitely has its strong points.  This machine is ALWAYS BEING PLAYED at the\nlocal arcade.  *ALWAYS*!  By little kids, disreputable Gen-X types and grown men\nalike.  And Brunswick is not exactly a hotbed of pinball activity.  I think\nWilliams made a big mistake in abandoning both pinball and Pinball 2000,\nregardless of what Wall Street may think.  Local reaction to this game seems to\nbe on my side.\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Star Wars: Episode I Pinball", "possible_shots": "Flippers, Slingshots, Left Outlane, Left Inlane, Left Target Bank, Left Orbit (C-3PO), Left Saucer (Watto's Junk Shop), Left Ramp, Left (Side) Center Target, Center Retractable Target, Video screen, Right (Side) Center Target, Right Ramp, Right Saucer (Mos Espa), Jet Bumpers, Flythrough Lane, Sith Droid Magnet, Right Target Bank, Right Inlane, Right Outlane, Plunger and Skill Shot", "manufacturer": "WMS Industries", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/starwarsepisodei.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

There's an opto sensor at the tom of the ramp to\ndetect a complete ramp shot.\n\nThe\nspinners award 1,000 points per \"spin\" but this value increases by 1,000 for\neach consecutive shot through that spinner up to a maximum of 10,000.\n\nThe ramps are also the most abusable point\nscorers on the table thanks to the \"X way combo\" scoring.\nEssentially, if you can shoot either ramp\nfast enough (about 2 or 3 seconds) after shooting either ramp, you are awarded\na combo shot.\nThe number of the combo\nshot is incremented each time and the point award is the number x 100,000\npoints.\nThis works past the 101 way\ncombo (when I got tired of waving the ball in front of the opto) which would\naward 10,100,000 points.\nYou can see why\nthis was limited in the tournament ROM release.\nLeft Purple Standup Target\nUsed in various modes, these\ntargets will also help start the holoprojector modes three times under the\ndefault settings.\nAfter that they only\nfunction in the modes.\nHoloprojector \"Gate\"\nThis is an up/down bumper assembly\nthat provides another \"hard target\" for the projections to interact with.\nIt seems to me that the actually switch is\neither an opto or an eddy sensor, I'm not sure which.\nThis is basically used to start the holoprojector modes.\nBehind it is the \"shield popper\" which is\nused to trap the ball during animations before it is popped up to the\nramps.\nWhich ramp the ball takes on\nexit depends a lot on how level the machine is, but I've never seen it get\nstuck.\nRight Purple Standup Target\nSee Left Purple Standup Target above.\nRight Ramp\nSee Left Ramp above\nMos Eisley Market Saucer\nSimilar in function to the Watto;s\nJunk Shop Saucer.\nThe awards seem to be\nthe same, only the method of displaying them is different.\nGungan Jet Rollover\nThere is a rollver behind the\nGungan Jets.\nI'm not sure exactly what\nfunction this serves.\nGungan Jets\nThree jet bumpers that when first\nactivated light an additional letter to spell out \"Gungan.\"\nWhen this is accomplished (the default\nsetting is no memory, so you've got to do this all in one ball) the right\nspinner changes to a fish-like creature.\nShooting the right ramp at this point adds a letter to spell out\n\"Jar-Jar.\"\nComplete \"Jar-Jar\" and\nyou'll get a whopping 2,000,000 points (try not to get too excited!)\nThere doesn't appear to be a \"super-jets\"\nstyle mode in this game.\nR2-D2 Alley \"Sneaky Lane\"\nBesides hearing R2-D2 whistle at\nyou, the only purpose for this lane is to collect skill shots and extra\nballs.\nSith Probe Triad\nThree square targets (similar to the\nMartian Targets in AFM - only reddish-orange) that when completed do pretty\nmuch the same thing as the Trade Federation Fighter Triad above.\nExcept the Dark Side gets to use a magnet\nand swing the ball around in some pretty unpredictable ways.\nThat magnet is big and fairly powerful.\nMost fun shot with the magnet?\nA ball heading down playfield was reversed\nand landed in the Market saucer!\nRight Inlane/Outlane\n3 red standups on the right. Shoot\nall 3 to light Merlin's Magic if unlit. Progress on the targets reset\nball-to-ball. \nRight Inlane / Outlane \nSee Left Inlane / Outlane above.\nSlingshots\nNothing special, just your regular\nslingshots.\nPlunger\nStandard shooter with NO\nautofire.\nThis is important during the\nJedi Battles.\n\nSkill Shots\n\nThe object is to fire the ball hard\nenough to get up the slope, but not so hard that it will spill into the right\nramp return lane.\nTo make things even\nmore difficult, I've occasionally seen a correct skill shot drop to the playfield\nand head up and out of the lane.\nSkill\nshot award is 1,000,000 points for the first time,\n2,000,000 points for the second time,\n3,000,000 points and a J-E-D-I letter for the third time, and\n3,000,000 points every time after that.\nSkill shots can be attempted at any ball launch except ball savers.\nYou can only collect the skill shot once\neach time you start the Jedi battle as well.\n\nBall Saver\nThere is a brief (~5 sec.) ball saver (after the ball hits either the inlane\nor skill shot) at the start of each ball. No ball saver at all during multiballs.\nJedi Battles are their own thing.\n\nA Word About the Bonus\nSW:E1 uses a different bonus system than I'm used to.\nThere are two components to figuring out\nyour bonus:\nThe multiplier and the\nNaboo Ship.\nA fully lit ship is worth\nexactly 1,000,000 points, and the maximum bonus multiplier is 5x, so the\nmaximum bonus, ever, is 5,000,000 points.\nHitting the 5x bonus is also called the Naboo bonus, but I haven't\nnoticed that it does anything different other than the music during bonus\ncollection\n(which is not\nbypassable).\nHolding a bonus will hold\nboth elements (Ship and multiplier).\n\nMultiball\nMultiball\nis started by putting a ball into each of the saucers (Mos Eisly Market and\nWatto's Junk Shop).\nIf you are playing\nwith more than one player it is possible to \"steal\" the other players\nmulti-ball prep work by starting your own multiball.\nIts also possible to knock the active ball into a saucered ball\nthat both come flying back at you.\nUseful in a multiplayer game, less so in a single player (and absolutely\nhorrible if it happens during a Jedi Battle)\nWhen\nmultiball is started, the center target lights up for a 1,000,000 jackpot.\nIf you drain 2 balls (or 3 if your ball\nsaver is still running) without making the first jackpot you will be offered\nthe opportunity to restart the multiball by shooting either saucer.\nI think the saucer shots are harder than the\ninitial jackpot, so I'd be surprised if this is used much.\nNote that the restarted multiball is only\ntwo balls (no auto-plunger, after all).\nIf you do find yourself restarting a multi-ball, don't forget to hit\nthat skill shot again.\nHere;s\nthe pattern for the jackpots:\n\nCenter target only \u2013\n1,000,000 points\nLeft and Right ramps \u2013\n1,000,000 points each\nCenter target, Left and\nRight ramps \u2013 1,000,000 points each with a Super Jackpot awarded for the\nlast of the three 5,000,000 points.\nRepeat the pattern.\n\nAfter\nyou've lost two of the three balls in play, the multiball ends and the saucers\ngo dark.\nTo relight the saucers you\nneed to hit either saucer once for each multiball that has been started.\nSo to lock the ball in the Junk Shop for the\nsecond multiball, you first need to hit either the Junk Shop or the Market once\nfirst.\n\nModes\nThe modes are presented in a semi-random order, with only a handful (5?)\navailable at the beginning of the game.\nFor every one you defeat, another is added until you have seen all\nthirteen modes.\nSome modes have\n\"Perfect Shooting\" awards which can be won instead of the completion\naward.\nIn the first round, \"Perfect\nShooting\" gets you 3,000,000 points while the regular completion mode is\n1,000,000 points. After completing the thirteenth mode, all the modes are made\navailable again\nOn the second pass completion\nbonuses (including \"Perfect Shooting\" bonuses) are doubled.\n\nGround Battle\n\nA Trade Federation Troop Transport is unloading\nhordes of battle druids.\nYou must\ndestroy the Transport.\nShooting the\nTransport three times will destroy it.\nIf you shoot nothing but the transport you will get a Perfect Shooting\ncompletion.\nNote that there are two\nSTAP's flying around the screen.\nYou\ncan hit them by hitting the ramp drop target then firing a ball up the ramp\nbefore the target resets.\nYou'll probably need to have a multiball going in order to do that.\nYou can also fire your lasers at the ground\ntroops (or the STAP's if there are no ground troops).\nFiring lasers will award you 150,000 points per droid.\nHitting them with the ball only awards\n100,000 points.\nThe STAP awards are\nbased on when you hit them.\nThe first\nis always worth 200,000 points (The Secret STAP Bonus).\nIf you hit the second very fast (like the\nsame time) you can get the Super Duper Secret STAP bonus of 1,000,000\npoints.\nWait too long and you'll have\nto settle for the Double Secret STAP bonus of 400,000 points.\nWait longer than that and you are back at\nthe 200,000 point award.\nHow to get\nthat Super Duper award?\nAs soon as the\nwave begins, before the Transport has a chance to place any druids, hit both\nlaser buttons (maybe even twice).\n\nSub Escape\n\nThe Escape line will slowly dwindle until the bongo\nis crunched. You have to make shots (up the center or the ramps) to increase\nthe line until it reads Escaped.\nThe ramps seem to increase the bar more that the center shot.\nI haven't found any specials in this mode.\n\nHanger Escape\n\nAnakin needs help getting rid of the battle druids\ncoming after him.\nShoot either ramp or\nthe center depending on where the druids are.\nLasers work in the mode, and druids killed with the lasers are worth the\nsame as druids killed with the ball - 200,000 points each.\nAfter all the druids are dead, shoot the\ncenter to leave the mode.\nIf every shot\nyou made hit a droid, you should get a perfect shooting bonus.\nI haven't found any specials in this mode.\n\nJar Jar Juggling\n\nJar Jar has too much on his hands, instead of\nhelping him, let's trip him instead.\nShoot the center to make him spill the goods.\nEach good is worth a set number of points:\n\n Red: 500,000 points\n Green: 2,000,000 points\n White: Increase Bonus Multiplier\n Purple: 1,500,000 points\n Yellow: 5 lasers\n Cyan: 1,000,000 points\n Silver Ball: Extra Ball (rare)\n\n\nYou only get to collect three of the five items, so\nchoose your shots carefully to maximize your score.\nI don't think there is a perfect shooting bonus here, and I\nhaven't found any specials in this mode.\n\nPodracing \n\nHelp Anakin try to complete the Boonta Eve\nPodrace.\nYou need three checkpoints\n(flags) to complete the race.\nOther\nsymbols will show up (left, right, and forward arrows).\nThe forward arrow makes you go faster, which\nmakes the checkpoints worth more.\nBasically try to shoot everything that isn't a checkpoint first.\nThere is no perfect shooter bonus.\nSpecials?\n\nSpace Battle\n\nBeat up on the Trade Federation Fighter Droids.\nThe scoring is kind of weird here, as a hit\nwith the ball releases four 200,000 point signs, while a hit with the lasers\nreleases only two 100,000 point signs.\nI'm going with 200,000 points for using lasers and 800,000 points for\nusing the ball.\nIf I'm right, this is a\nvery lucrative round.\nThere may be a\nPerfect Shooting bonus here, not sure.\nSpecials?\n\nSith Droids\n\nHelp Queen Amadala shoot three sith probe droids\nthat are causing her anguish.\nLasers\nnot allowed.\nThe target gets faster in\nlater rounds of this mode.\nYou score\nabout 250,000 points per droid.\nThere\nis likely a perfect shooting bonus.\nSpecials, anyone?\n\nR2-D2 Astrodroid\n\nThis is a series of six hurry-ups.\nEach hurry-up starts at 500,000 no matter\nwhat the last one started or ended at.\nThe hurry-up will be reset and increased by 100,000 points for each ramp\nshot made, up to 2,000,000 maximum.\nSince you can be working the combo abuse during this stage, it makes it\na very high scorer.\nIf the hurry-up\nhits bottom (50,000 points) you will not be able to reset it for that\ndroid.\nNo perfect shooting bonus.\nSpecials?\n\nQueen\u2019s Game\n\nThe object is to reveal the six fashion plates\nshowing the Queen's various looks.\nReveal a plate by triggering the left or right spinner.\nSpin the plates by shooting the center or\nfiring lasers.\nI'm not sure of the\npoint values.\nI don't think there is a\nperfect shooter bonus.\nSpecials?

{"page_content": "From krellan.spam@krellan.com Mon Aug 23 07:45:41 1999\nNewsgroups: rec.games.pinball\nSubject: Quick take: STE1\nFrom: krellan.spam@krellan.com (Krellan)\nDate: Mon, 23 Aug 1999 04:45:41 -0700\n\nOK, here's a quick take of STE1.  The game is similar to Revenge From\nMars, in that a lot of it focuses on repeatedly banging the center\ntarget, but it is more varied and it feels like there is more to do in\nthe game.\n\nIt's a lower-scoring game.  Default extra ball score is 20M and 60M,\nthere are no replays.  A good game is around 100M, the high scoreboards\nstart at around 150M.\n\nThe playfield is very nice-looking and crisp.  There's a lightsaber that\nis made of neon, on the right side of the game, like Cirqus Voltaire but\nstraight instead of curved.  Unlike the prototype games, though, the\nlightsaber does not move... it's now fixed in place.\n\nMain points:\n\nSkill Shot = you get a manual plunger, and the game has NO autoplunger!\nDrop the ball into a hole, just before it enters the right ramp.  It's\nlike shooting the bottom hole in TOTAN: you have unlimited tries to get\nthe skill shot if you plunge too gently, but if you plunge too hard you\nwill miss.  This shot is VERY important, because making the skill shot is\nthe *only* reliable way to hit the extra ball lane!\n\nExtra Ball = two of them for score (20M and 60M), one of them for\nbuilding C3-PO.  Haven't found any more.\n\nJedi lights/rankings = You get JEDI letters for doing well in modes, and for\nvarious other things in the game.  Spell JEDI and you advance a rank\nand get the Saber Battle (a multiball where you must plunge all balls\nyourself as they drain, like the Final Battle in TOTAN and the Ransom in\nBK2K).  Defeat Darth Maul and the flippers go *dead*, forcing you to return\nto one ball in play (if you have a ball at the plunger, you use that, or the\ngame will give you a new ball).  Winning Saber Battle (it's very easy) gives\nyou a Jedi rank: Jedi Youth, Knight, Lord, or Spirit.  Each of these ranks\nhas its own \"high score table\", giving initials of the last 10 players to hit\nthese ranks!  The highest I was able to get was Jedi Knight.\n\nModes = See below for a description of the center shot.  Surprisingly, the\ncenter shot is not that bad of a drain shot!  Balls on this game tend to\nlast longer than  they do on RFM.  It seems like an easier game, which\nmakes it more fun.  There's a TON of modes, I played a lot of the game and\ndid not make it through them.\n\nTour of the playfield:\n(clockwise, left drain to right drain)\n\nLeft bank of three standup targets -- lights the left \"Force\" blue light.  The\n\ntwo blue lights are wide and mostly useless, like the \"Radar Detector\"\nlights in HS.  Not sure what these do.\n\nLeft orbit -- feeds the bumpers.  You build C3-PO by repeatedly shooting\nthis lane.  This lights Extra Ball the first time, and gives minor awards\nlater on.\n\nLeft saucer -- has a captive ball behind it.  It's like the left saucer\nin TOTAN.  The captive ball helps slow down the ball, helping it land in\nthe saucer.  The saucer is a direct shot from the flippers, like on\nJohnny Mneumonic.  Fill both saucers for Multiball!  Both of these\nsaucers hold over between players and between games?\n(Watto's Junk Shop: awards a random value.)\n\nLeft ramp -- this is one of the three big things in the game that are hit\nduring modes.  If you're not in a mode, there is a \"virtual spinner\" on\nthe ramp!  It spins around, like a real spinner, when you hit the ball up\nthe ramp.  Unfortunately, it spins the same length regardless of how hard\nyou hit it!  Williams missed a BIG opportunity here: they could have used\ntwo optos, like Checkpoint, to time the ball!  Then, they could have had\nthe spinner spin faster with harder hits, like a real spinner...\n\nLeft standup -- not used for much.  The only time you hit this is when\nyou miss the shot to the left ramp or the center.\n\nCenter -- the big thing in the game, of course.  The \"horseshoe\" in RFM\nhas been straightened out and squared off, to 90-degree angles.  There is\na barrier, about three inches wide, and horizontal, like the saucer force\nfield in AFM.  Usually, shots just bounce off of it.  When the game wants\nto hold the ball, though, it will raise, like the bulldozer on Road Show.\nThere is a large hole behind it, that the ball is channeled into, making\nit an easy shot.  ASCII diagram follows:\n\n        (____) hole\n       /      \\\n     /          \\\n   /              \\\n  | ============= | barrier\n  |               |\n  |               |\n  |               |\n==|               |== standup target(s)\n\nThe barrier is usually up, but it goes down to start modes and to finish\nmodes (like RFM, you finish a mode by hitting the center, and this\nusually makes the object on the screen go \"boom\").  Hit the barrier three\ntimes to light a mode.  Shoot it, and the ball goes in the hole, and you\nstart the mode and see its animation (a few seconds of movie footage).\nThe ball then kicks out to one of the ramps, and the barrier\nrises again until the mode is done.\n\nRight standup -- same as left standup.\n\nRight saucer -- same as left saucer, but this does NOT have a captive\nball behind it.  Instead, it has two pieces of metal which form a \"V\"\naround the back of the saucer.  It is very hard to get the ball to stay\nin this saucer!  Direct shots to the saucer are rejected and bounce out,\nso you have to hit it by luckily bouncing off something else.\n(Mos Espa Market: also awards a random value.)\n\nBumpers -- fed by the left orbit.  These can be shot directly, but the\nball won't stay very long in the bumpers then.  If the ball comes around\nvia the left orbit, though, the ball can bounce around for a very long\ntime!\n\nRight bank of three standup targets -- same as the left bank.  When both of\nthe blue lights are lit, they flash then disappear.  Woohoo!\n\nMagnet -- this is under the playfield, a few inches in front of the right bank\nof standup targets, and throws the ball around in a rude way.  I'm not sure\nwhat causes it to activate.\n\nSkill shot lane -- a twisty little lane, like the Special lane on Star Wars\nTrilogy.  It winds behind the right bank of standup targets, with a top and\nbottom opening.  Extra Ball is lit here.  The only reliable way to hit\nthis lane is via the Skill Shot, which drops the ball right into\nthis lane.  Unfortunately, the Skill Shot has two\nbig problems: the dropoff point is too far back, near the top exit from this\nlane, so the ball can easily spin out of the lane and not go through the lane\n(thus\ndenying you your Extra Ball).  And, the exit from the lane often goes SDTM!\n\nThat's really it... the bottom of the game is standard.  Very elegant game,\nslickly designed.  Watch for the virtual Roto-Target(!) in one of the modes!\n\nJosh\n\n--\n______              Hear the \"Dr. Demento\" show on the Net:\n\\Josh/ Lehan                    http://krellan.com/demento/\n \\  /  mailto:any.email.you.want@that.ends.with.krellan.com\n  \\/   http://krellan.com/                    ICQ# 10155825\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "STE1", "possible_shots": "Skill Shot, Extra Ball, Jedi lights/rankings, Modes, Left bank of three standup targets, Left orbit, Left saucer, Left ramp, Left standup, Center, Right standup, Right saucer, Bumpers, Right bank of three standup targets, Magnet, Skill shot lane", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/starwarsepisodei-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

Hitting a slingshot will move the\nLight Saber Saver light to the opposite outlane\n(this is adjustable).  Also, slingshots rotate\nlit FORCE letters during single ball play.\n\n     Inlanes        Lights Landspeeder at opposite orbit.\n\n     Outlane        Light Saber Saver when lit, which activates a\nvirtual kickback.\n\n     Special Lane   A tiny lane just below the swiveling X-Wing.\nNormally advances bonus X, is sometimes lit for\nspecial.\n\n     X-Wing         A rotating turret aimed towards 4 drop targets on\nthe opposite end of the playfield.  Can be loaded\nvia the ramp or the Mode Start VUK.\n\n Light Saber Saver Targets        3 targets on the left side of the game.  Hit any\non the bank 3 times for Light Saber Saver, the\nvirtual kickback.\n\n     Magnet         A small magnet in the left-side ramp return, which\ndiverts balls into the X-Wing when active.\n\n     Left Orbit     Collect Landspeeder when lit.\n\n     'F' Target     One of 5 F-O-R-C-E targets.  Used to light a\nHurry-Up or other mode at the Han Hole.\n\n     Ramp           Shoot to spell FALCON and start Falcon Multiball.\nAlso used to load the X-Wing.\n\n     Cannon Turret  Cool toy above the ramp with guns that move when\nthe ball touches them.  It also is a diverter which\nsend ramp shots either to a left or right return\nlane.\n\n     'O' Target     See 'F' Target.\n\n     Bumpers        4 pop/jet bumpers with the Imperial Signia on them.\n\n     'R' Target     See 'F' Target.\n\n     'C' Target     See 'F' Target.\n\n     Mode Start     Used to light and start Heroic modes, and also\ncollects Extra Ball.  Can be used to load X-Wing.\n\n     'E' Target     See 'F' Target.\n\n Luke Jackpot Lane    A small lane above the drop targets, only useful\nduring one mode.  A tight shot, it can only be hit\ndirectly from the X-Wing.\n\n     Drop targets   4 targets used to light multiball, and also used to\nblock shots from the X-Wing(!)\n\n     Tie Fighter    Another cool toy that won't harm anything if it\nbreaks.  It rocks when you hit drop targets, and\nsometimes when you shoot the ramp.\n\n     Right Orbit    Remarkably similar in purpose to the Left Orbit.    \n\n     Carbonite Han  Toy #4 with 8 blinking LED's that tell you how\nmany more Han Hole lights you need to Thaw Han.\n\n     Han Hole       A gigantic hole on the right end of the playfield\nwhich starts Hurry-Ups, Probe Multiball, Bounty\nHunter, and Thaw Han (trivia question).  Don't be\nmisled by its size, more shots than you might\nexpect will skip over, cup out, or just plain miss,\nespecially with brand new flippers.\n\n     Backglass      Okay, so it's not part of the playfield, but it\nbears mentioning.  Operators have a choice of\nbuying a normal (cheaper) backglass, or a cool 3-D\nversion.  In addition to the convex shape\nintroduced with Space Jam, the 3-D backglass has\na nifty effect where an X-Wing fighter appears\nto come out of the backglass, and the Tie-Fighter\nappears to shoot when you move your head side to\nside.  I'm told this is done with a lenticular\nlens, whatever that is.  It's well worth the cost,\nfor all you collectors/operators out there reading\nthis.\n\nSkill Shot\nDarth Vader scans his head from side to side, and when you press\nthe Fire button / both flippers, the escape pod (and your ball)\nis launched.\n\nThe \"shot\" part was finished by production time, but not the\n\"skill\" portion.  I half-recall something about gameplay being\naffected in some unannounced way depending on where Darth was\nlooking when you plunged, but I don't remember if this was a\nrandom theory or substantiated fact.\nStar Wars Multiball\nLet's cut right to the chase; Star Wars Multiball is a major part\nof the game.\n\nHow to Light\nA 4 x 4 matrix of Tie Fighter lights sits beside the 4 drop\ntargets.  At the start of the game, a solid row of lights will\ncycle among the 4 drops.  Hitting the target next to the lit row\nwill immediately light multiball, ala Pin/Jack*bot.  If not, you\nhave to shoot each target 4 times (16 Tie Fighters) to light\nmultiball.  After your first multiball, you always have to do it\nthe long way.\n\nIf you have yet to start multiball, Tie Fighters will be\nspotted for you when you drain.  I don't recall if multiball is\na gimme on Ball 3 even if you didn't work for it, like with many\nSega games of late.\n\nHow to Start\nShoot the ramp (or the Mode Start VUK if not lit) to load the\nX-Wing.  At your first multiball, the middle 2 drop targets will be\ndown and the outside 2 will be up.  You have to shoot the ball\nthrough the gap and into the heretofore unmentioned hole under\nthe Tie Fighter toy in order to start multiball.  If you miss, you\nhave to reload the X-Wing and try again.\n\nSometimes it gets confused if you make a partial ramp shot, and\nit thinks that the ball is in the X-Wing when it's not (at least on\nour machine).  Also, our X-Wing malfunctioned briefly during a\ngame, an \"Operator Alert\" message appeared, and the X-Wing was\nconsidered disabled.  In this situation, ramp shots feed the left\nflipper, and you have to shoot the gap from there (much harder).\n\nHow to Play\nOnce multiball (3-ball?) starts, the ramp is lit for Jackpot\n(500K, plus 2K/switch).  After collecting the ramp, the F-O-R-C-E\ntargets are flashing.  They are worth the Jackpot value, which\ncontinues to increase by 2K/switch.  Drops increase jackpot by\n10K each.  Shoot all 5 F-O-R-C-E targets to light Super Jackpot.\n\nWhen Super Jackpot is lit, shoot the ramp to load the X-Wing.\nThen shoot the gap like you did to start Multiball.  You have to\ndo this with all the other balls bouncing around, ala Terminator 2.\nCollecting Super Jackpot is one of 6 Darth Vader tasks.\n\nIf you fail to shoot at least the Ramp jackpot before draining\ndown to 1 ball, the ramp and Mode Start VUK are lit for 15 seconds\nto load the X-Wing for another shot at starting Multiball.  A\nrestarted multiball will be 2-ball only.\nHeroic Modes\nThere are 6 Heroic modes which correspond to 7 major characters:\nLuke, Leia, Han, C3P0/R2D2, Chewie, and Obi Wan.  Collect all 6\nfor, um, something related to Extra Ball I'm guessing :)\n\nStart a mode by shooting the Mode Start hole.  It's lit at the\nstart of each ball, and unlights after a mode.  Shoot it to\nrelight it, and shoot it again to start another mode.  The next\nmode up is chosen in order, left to right, top to bottom, and\ncontinues between players and even different games.\n\nAll modes are preempted by Multiball, which you can start in any\nmode.  The mode continues when you're done.  Modes end at the\nend of the ball, when you complete them, or if they time out.\nModes are worth 100K plus whatever you earn during the mode.\nCompleting any Mode is one of 6 Darth Vader tasks.\n\nLuke\nShoot the ramp or Mode Start to load the X-Wing, and then\nshoot the tiny Luke Jackpot Lane above the drop targets to trip\nan Imperial Walker.  You have 20? seconds to make the shot,\nwhich is worth 500K.  The mode ends on one successful shot.\n\nLeia\nShoot the ramp to strangle Jabba.  3 shots are needed to\nfinish, which are worth 200K, 300K, and 400K.  The ramp shots can\nbe looped, and you have 20? seconds to make them.\n\nHan\nHurry-up is lit at the Han Hole to escape from the Space Slug.\nThe value starts at 420K, counting down until 100K.  You can't\nreasonably expect to get more than 380K or so.  The mode ends on\none successful shot, or if it times out (15? seconds or so).\n\nC3P0/R2D2\nOur heros are being crushed in the garbage compactor.  Shoot\nthe mode start hole for 50K, 150K, and 250K to end the mode.\n\nChewie\nC3P0 is in pieces, and you have to make 4 shots to gather up\nthe parts (ala Graveyard from Frankenstein).  Shoot the left orbit,\nramp, mode start, and right orbit in any order.  The first shot is\n100K, then 200K, 300K, and 400K.  These correspond to an arm, left\nleg, right leg, and then the head.  Also, I don't think there's an\nanimation showing the mode total when you're done, unlike the other\n5 Heroic modes.\n\nObi Wan\nUse the force to get past weak-minded Stormtroopers.  Shoot\nthe right orbit for 250K, the left orbit for 300K, and then the\nramp for 350K to finish the mode.  Move along, move along.\nFalcon Multiball\nLoop the ramp to spell FALCON and start Falcon Multiball.  This\ndoesn't work during modes.  After your first Falcon Multiball the\nletters start to time out if you don't get another quickly.  The\npace speeds up the more often you get Falcon Multiball.  There's\na cool display effect of a banking Millennium Falcom when\ncollecting a letter.\n\nFalcon Multiball starts with 4 balls, and 40 switches needed to\nlight the ramp for Falcon Jackpot (ala Twister's Chase Multiball).\nCollecting the first Falcon Jackpot adds a ball (unless you haven't\ndrained one).  You need 60 switches to light the next jackpot, then\n80, etc.  The first jackpot is 200K plus 2K/switch after lighting\nit, then 600K plus 2K/switch.  The third is reportedly worth 800K.\nCollecting a Falcon Jackpot is one of 6 Darth Vader tasks.\nHurry-Ups\nShoot the 5 F-O-R-C-E targets in any order to light a Hurry-Up\nat the Han Hole.  Shoot the Han Hole to start it.  You can't do\neither during a mode.  They aren't all Hurry-Ups, per se.\n\nCheck the Instant Info (or shoot a FORCE target) to see which\nhurry-up you're trying to light.  I haven't seen a pattern as to\nwhich one is up next; it might depend on which target you hit\nfirst, or the \"skill\" shot, or randomness.\n\n\nExtra-Ball Hurry-Up\n\nThe Mode Start hole is lit for 15 seconds, or else you'll be\nblown up by a thermal detonator.  Ouch.\n\nSpecial Hurry-Up\n\nShoot the very difficult Special Lane just under the X-Wing.\nYou have 15 seconds to shoot Greedo and win a free game (operator\nadjustable to award EB or points).\n\nCantina Hurry-Ups\n\nShoot the ramp for hurry-up values, counting down from ?K to\n100K.  You can loop the ramp for multiple awards.\n\nBounty Hunter\n\nBoba Fett points to a seemingly random award, which I've never\nseen be anything but Video Mode.  There are rumors of a hidden mode\npossible here.\n\n\nVideo Mode\n\nRun over Stormtrooper with your Landspeeder, and avoid\neverything else.  The perspective is similar to Guns'N'Roses'\nvideo mode, and the pattern is completely identical!\nReportedly, you can get an Extra Ball with a perfect score;\nyou must not only survive, but also run over all the men.\n\nProbe Droid Multiball\n\nA 2-ball multiball, where one drop target is up.  Shoot it for\n200K, and another will appear.  The value goes up by 50K each time.\n\nCompleting a Hurry-Up is a Darth Vader task.  In Cantina, you need\nto make at least one shot.  In Probe Droid Multiball, you need to\nmake at least one drop target.  I'm not sure if you need a perfect\nscore in Bounty Hunter, or merely to survive completely through it.\n\nLandspeeder\nShoot orbits when lit for 50K, with a 300K award on your fourth\nshot.  On your fifth shot after that, you collect extra ball.  On\nyou sixth shot after that, you get another 300K bonus.\n\nOrbits are lit by the inlanes, or by making an orbit.  They may\nbe other ways too.  Getting the first 300K bonus is a Darth Vader\ntask.\nThaw Han Solo\nYou need 3 Han Hole shots (not during a Heroic mode) to Thaw Han\nthe first time.  You need 1 additional shot to get your next Thaw\neach time you do it.  Shots which don't Thaw Solo are worth 50K,\nand those that do are worth 300K.\n\nWhen you Thaw Solo, you are asked a trivia question about Star\nWars.  See Appendix A for a list of questions, and the Spoilers for\nanswers.\n\nThawing Han Solo is a Darth Vader task.\nLight Saber Saver\nShoot the Light Saber Saver bank a number of times to light an\noutlane for the Light Saber Saver virtual kickback.  Only one\noutlane can be lit at a time.  The lit outlane can be changed by\nthe slingshots; the opposite outlane from the slingshot hit will\nbecome lit.  The number of hits required to light the Saver goes\nup the more times you get it, and is percentaged.  You typically\nneed about 3 hits the first time.\nExtra Balls\n9 lit orbits, 6X bonus, and/or complete all 6 Heroic Modes.  You\nmay only need to start the 6th mode; I've heard conflicting\nstories on this.  Bozo ball lit on Ball 3 of less than exemplary\nperformances.\nSo what are all these Darth Vader tasks good for?\nCheck Spoilers if you're insufficiently patient to do it on your\nown.\nBonus\nBonus is multiplied by the Special Lane, at any point in the game.\nGetting bonus X up to 6X is worth an Extra Ball.  Not that this is\neasy.\n\nStill working on how bonus works (composed of Ramps, Loops, Puzzle,\nand Heroic components), but a good multiplied bonus can be worth\nseveral million, which is quite a lot of points.  Replay on our\nmachine is about 10M, and goes up 3M each time.\nWizard/Tournament Mode\nWizard mode stops spotting of Tie Fighters upon draining before\nyour first multiball.  One or both of these likely disables Bozo\nball.  You start the game in one of these modes by holding a\nflipper button while pressing Start.\nMore Work Needed\nThis is still a work in progress.  If you know more about\nsomething I'm missing, or wrong about, please contact me at\nhehman @ vnet.net and get your name in the Credits list.  I'm\nlikely to see followups in rec.games.pinball, but not always\nguaranteed due to flaky access.\nCredits\nChris Hehman, primary author\nLea Ann Armentrout, secondary author\nOrin Day (thanks again!)\nAndy and Cindy Mercier\nBrian MacLean (TaZBoy)\nMichael J. Lewis\nAnd other r.g.p'ers for their helpful comments.\nIf I missed your name, please let me know!\nBrags\nNot much to brag about yet, but I got 24.5M on my first game ever.\nLocal high scores in the 30's-40's; surely someone out there has\nheard of a better score?\nAppendix A: Trivia Questions\n32 questions, in a repeating cycle, answers taken from a kind of\nencyclopedia about the Star Wars universe.  There are two choices\nfor each question, left flipper vs. right flipper.  Choose wisely.\n\nI haven't mustered the patience to catalogue the questions and\nanswers yet, nor am I likely to.  Someone else can if they wish,\nbut be sure to keep the answers in a Spoiler form if you post them\nto r.g.p.\nSpoilers:\nContains information about the Redemption of Darth Vader wizard\nmode, and general strategy hints.  Proceed at your own risk.\n\n[insert Yoda quote about not having any patience here]\nThe Redemption of Darth Vader\n(courtesy Michael J. Lewis):\n\nIt's lit at the Heroic VUK after you get the last award.  It's a\ntwo-ball multiball, 50 seconds long, ball-saver on the whole time.\nLoad the cannon, shoot into the Tie Fighter.  When the cannon is\nloaded, though, no drop targets go down automatically.  You have to\nknock down some of the drop targets with the other ball just before\nthe cannon starts rotating and fire through the hole you make (so\nit's not really possible to sight the shot by putting your head\nover the gun).  Shots are worth between 3M and 4M; I don't know if\nthe mode ends if you make enough of them, but (a) I assume that it\ndoes end eventually because the intro seems to imply it, and (b)\nit takes more than four successful shots to score it.\nStrategy\nGetting Super Jackpot is by far the most difficult task needed to\nstart the lucrative Darth Vader mode, and it's not too shabby for\npoint value on its own.\n\nAs you will soon/have already discovered, the 'C' and 'E' force\ntargets are the biggest obstacles to getting SJ, notably the 'C'\ntarget.  Both are all the way in the back of the game near the VUK,\nand the 'C' target is angled peculiarly and partially blocked by a\npiece of rubber or something.  Direct shots are hard but not\nimpossible; aim a bit to the left to avoid the rubber.  You\nsometimes get a free hit from the bumpers, if you can manage to\nkeep a ball there.\n\nOnce you've lit SJ, catch a ball on the left flipper and shoot the\nramp with the other ball (you're probably down to 2 by this point).\nWhen the target drops, there's nothing that says that you have to\nuse the ball in the X-Wing to shoot the gap; you could decide to\nshoot it with the caught ball if you want.\n\nMore strategy to come later I hope.\nTrivia Question Answers\nNone yet.  Answers to the 32 2-choice questions may at some point\nbe presented as an 8 digit hex string for spoiler purposes :)\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition", "manufacturer": "Sega", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/starwarstrilogy.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

First the legal stuff. This guide is posted as freeware and as\nsuch may be used In any way, as long as no profit is made from it\u2019s use\nand credit to the author and any contributors remain intact. So there!\n:-)\nStar Wars is copyright Lucasfilm and as such is of no concern to me.\nJust imagine tm after each word and we should be ok.\nThe Story So Far\nAt least I had some warning that this game was coming. Star Wars went\non site in early March and for once I didn't have to fight to get a game\non it. This machine has been a constant source of frustration (for me at\nleast) as each time I've played it, something has malfunctioned. I've had\ndiverters not divert, stuck balls which messed up the X-Wing to the point\nwhere only power cycling and lifting up the machine would solve the problem\nand large nuts rolling down the ramp and sitting in the middle of the playfield\njust waiting to be hit. I would assume that this is just this machine with\nproblems, but it really lowers my opinions somewhat. Hopefully I might\nget to play one that works so I can get an idea of how good or bad this\ngame really is. This sheet is based on limited playing time and is in need\nof input in several areas.\n\nNew to This Version\nSome HUGE errors corrected. Bragging section added. I have only encountered\n1 fully operational Star Wars Trilogy machine to date. I assume that this\nis the fault of the operators and not dodgy hardware or design.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nStarting at the drain and moving clockwise around:\nOutlanes The usual. No kickback, but each outlane can be lit\nfor Light Saber Saver. This is a ball save which switches between outlanes\nwith each slingshot hit.\nInlanes Normal. Lights Landspeeder loop.\nFlippers 2 of them in the normal position.\nSlingshots Normal size and shape.\nAdv Bonus Lane A small narrow lane just above the left inlane.\nOnly shootable from the right flipper. Can be lit for a hurry-up special.\nLight Saber Targets 3 targets completely hidden by the X-Wing.\n3 hits re-light the outlane save.\nLeft Orbit Landspeeder loop. Feeds around the back of the machine\nto the right orbit. Awards are given at various numbers of orbits.\nF Target 1 of 5 spelling Force.\nRamp Feeds to the right inlane and spots a letter in Falcon,\nunless load X-Wing is lit.\nCannon A large gun sitting about 1/4 of the way up the ramp.\nWhen load X-Wing is lit the ball is supposed to be caught in the cannon\nand kicked on to another habitrail which feeds the X-Wing.\nX-Wing A model X-Wing fighter. When lit the ball is kicked out\nof the cannon and is pulled off the habitrail into the X-Wing. This is\na copy of the cannon on T2 and serves the same purpose.\nO Target 1 of 5 spelling Force.\nR Target 1 of 5.\nBumpers 4 bumpers in a diamond formation in the top centre of\nthe playfield.\nC Target 1 of 5.\nTop Hole A saucer which feed to the cannon via a VUK. Used to\nstart modes. Can be lit for extra ball.\nE Target 1 of 5.\nJackpot Lane A small loop feeding the right orbit. Labelled as\njackpot but only used in the Luke mode.\nTie Fighter Targets 4 drop targets in front of a large sinkhole.\n4 hits on each target lights multiball.\nRight Orbit Same as the left.\nHUGE Sinkhole A sinkhole which would be at home on Hercules.\nThe sinkhole from hell. Can be lit for start hurry-up. Because of it's\nshape the ball has a habit of looping the edge of the hole and flying back\nout. Backhand shots work better.\nRules\nYour mission is to complete 6 tasks which are displayed between the\nflippers. Completing all 6 lights a wizard award.\nThe tasks are:\nSuper Jackpot-- Score a super jackpot.\nHurry-up-- Light, start and collect any hurry-up.\nFalcon Jackpot-- Score a falcon jackpot during Falcon multiball.\nLandspeeder-- Reach the first landspeeder award.\nComplete Heroic-- Start and complete any mode.\nThaw Han-- 3 shots to the right sinkhole.\nLighting all 6 lights a wizard award which is called The Redemption\nof Darth Vader. This is a 2 ball multiball and the objective is to\nload the X-Wing with 1 ball, then knock down enough drop targets with the\nother ball to allow the 1st ball to be shot through the gap. Each successful\nshot is worth 50k.\n\nModes\nThere are 6 modes called heroics. The top hole starts a mode and is\nsupposed to feed the ball to the left inlane via the cannon. The modes\nare:\nLeia Your mission is to choke Jabba the Hut. The display shows\nLeia with a chain around his neck which she pulls tighter with each ramp\nshot. 3 ramps chokes Jabba. The ramps score 200k then 300k and finally\n400k. the mode lasts about 30 seconds.\nLuke Load the X-Wing and shoot the ball through the narrow lane\nwithin 30 seconds for a 500k jackpot. Easily the hardest mode.\nChewie Rebuild C3P0. The ramp, both orbits and the top hole score\npoints and award a body part. The points are 100k, 200k, 300k and finally\n400k.\nC3P0/R2D2 Shoot the top hole 3 times to stop the trash compactor.\nscores 50k+ 100k per shot. Obi Wan shoot the lit shots to confuse\nthe stormtroopers. The first shot is the right orbit, then the ramp, then\nthe left orbit. Each shot scores 150k+ 100k per shot.\nHan Solo A hurry-up. Shoot the right hole to escape from the\nslug and award the points. The value starts at 420k.\nMultiball\nThe 3 ball multiball is started by shooting the drop targets 4 times\neach. This lights load X-Wing at the ramp and the top hole. Load the X-Wing\nand launch the ball through the drop targets to start. The ramp scores\nthe first jackpot of 500k+1k for each switch hit. The Force targets are\nthen lit and each 1 spots a letter in force and scores the jackpot value.\nSpotting all 5 lights load X-wing for the super jackpot. Load the X-Wing\nand fire through the drop targets to score 1M+ the switch value. The sequence\nthen starts again. There is no ball save at the start which I find very\nirritating. This appears to be the standard for SEGA pins.\nFalcon Multiball\nThe Falcon Multiball is started by 6 ramp shots. The 6th starts multiball\nand launches an additional 3 balls into play. 40 switches lights the ramp\nfor jackpot. The jackpot starts at 200k and increases by 2k for each switch\nafter lighting jackpot. Collecting the jackpot resets the counter and you\nstart again needing an extra 10 switch hits to light a 600k jackpot.\nMisc. Scoring\nLandspeeder Each loop scores 50k and consecutive loops score\nan extra 50k per loop until you miss. At 3 loops you score 300k. Then an\nextra ball is lit after 4 more loops, then 300k after 5 more and so on.\nHurry-up Light the 5 Force targets to light a hurry-up at the\nright hole.The Hurry-up is chosen randomly from the 5 displayed around\nthe Han hole.\nCantina Hurry-up: Hurry-up starting at 420k. Shoot the ramp to collect.\nThe value is re-awarded each time you hit the ramp until you miss.\nHurry-up extra ball: Shoot the top hole within 15 seconds to collect.\nHurry-up special: Shoot the lane under the X-Wing within 15 seconds\nto collect. VERY hard to get.\nBounty Hunter: Video Mode. Lifted directly from Guns'n'Roses.\nProbe Droids: 2 ball multiball. One drop target is raised and your aim\nis to hit it. The value starts at 250k? and increases by 50k until you\nlose a ball.\nTrivia Game Thawing Han awards 300k and a chance to play a trivia\ngame. The machine displays a question and 2 answers. Choose the correct\none for 300k.\nGame Variations\nAt the start of the game you are given the choice of playing either\nthe normal 3 ball game or a novice game which guarantees a 2 minute game\ntime with the ball saver active. When the ball saver times out, the first\ndrain ends the game. Holding in the left flipper and pressing start gives\nLeague mode and holding the right flipper gives Wizard mode. No known differences\nat this time.\nBragging\nHighest score so far: 67M.\n\nIf you have any additions, corrections or comments please e-mail them\nto me via chrisb@enternet.com.au\nand I will include them in a future version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition", "manufacturer": "SEGA", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/starwarstrilogy2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Let the ball bounce off of the right flipper and come to a dead\n      stop on left flipper.\n\n   5. Then shoot right ramp again to start the combo all over at 7M, 8M,\n      9M and 10M.\n\n   6. The higher the hurry-up value is the longer you have to keep the\n      Shootout going.\n\n\n   Ball control tip:\n   ----------------\n\n   TIP 1: When the ball is ejected from the VUK the the top flipper there\n   is generally no incentive to shoot for the middle ramp. Lock is\n   usually lit on both the right and middle ramps. So as above, keeping\n   the flipper up , bouncing off the bottom right flipper, stopping on\n   the left flipper for an easy controlled lock shot to the right ramp\n   (which is much easier and safer than the middle ramp).\n\n   TIP 2: There seems to be an invisible smaller goalie behind the main\n   one cuz 50% of the shots to the left side of the goal come flying back\n   out. One thing to try is to delay the ball by keeping the right\n   flipper up while the ball is releasing from the stadium. When the ball\n   get about 75% up the flipper let go then quickly flip again to shoot a\n   *weak shot to the goal which usually stays in. Also this slight delay\n   opens up a bigger left side gap during shootout because a direct shot\n   from the stadium on the fly the goalie is usually in the middle.\n\n   * I realize a WEAK shot from a SEGA FLIPPER are redundant terms so no\n   need to point it out!\n\n\n   Multiball:\n   ---------\n\n   During mulitiball its often more lucrative to shoot goals than the\n   small jackpots since it only takes 1 goal to defeat a country during\n   multiball. Its hard but with 2 balls in play, capture 1 on each\n   flipper. Shoot one right after the other at the same drop target to\n   sneak one through before it pops back up for an easy goal. Also\n   jamming a bunch of balls in the VUK then breaking the plane of the\n   goal awards a goal.\n\n\n   The dog is toast!\n   ----------------\n\n   I don't condone this strategy but it is there: Shoot the impossible to\n   miss left VUK. When it kicks the ball into the left return lane hold\n   the left flipper up and pass it to the right.(flipper pass) Repeat\n   till Shootout is lit then follow the Shootout cheapout strat. Only\n   recommended after the celebration multiball when lighting locks and\n   shooting goals starts getting tough.\n\n\n   Xtreme everything:\n   -----------------\n\n   Defeating the second tier of countries starts extreme everything. All\n   shots lit for 3M X number of shots made in the alotted time. This can\n   be valuable but is not collectable if the 2nd tier is beaten during\n   Multiball.\n\n\n   Celebration Multiball:\n   ---------------------\n\n   Defeating all countries starts Celebration Multiball. Ramp shots worth\n   5M and lock the ball. When all balls locked shoot goals for 25M (2\n   seconds per ball in play)\n\n\n   Fan Riot:\n   ---------\n\n   Reaching bonus 10X starts Fan Riot Multiball. All switches worth 100K,\n   ramps worth 5M, shoot goals to kill the referee for 7M plus increase\n   switch value by 50K.\n\n\n   Other Stuff:\n   -----------\n\n   The free kick ball save \"disappears\" during certain modes so be\n   careful. Especially when doing the ultra worthless halftime. The side\n   ramp is poorly designed. Like Dirty Harry's right ramp perfect shots\n   get rejected. The key is to aim as low as possible (I know, I know,\n   its impossible to aim with weak flippers).\n\n\n   Tournament Strategy:\n   -------------------\n\n   Probably Best to complete the first tier of countries BEFORE getting\n   multiball since just hitting the lit drop target spots the whole bank.\n   Then when it starts getting tougher in the 2nd tier, shoot for\n   Multiball. Once celebration multiball is finished the only worthwhile\n   thing to shoot for is bonus X and the jet booster (right loop) or\n   Shootout.\n\n   It looks like for a tournament game, the modes will come in the\n   following\n   order, for each player:\n   xtreme xball\n   xtreme combos\n   xtreme mball\n   xtreme goals\n   xtreme spinner\n   xtreme pops\n   xtreme goalie\n   xtreme everything (yes, it's also possible to get that here)\n\n   This is unconfirmed by actual play so dont hold me liable. If this is\n   true then the xball should be worth 35M which is not bad for getting\n   an xtreme goal on the first tier. Also xtreme combo is very easy and\n   definitely  worth some points. Same strategy for xtreme combo as\n   lighting shootout. Shoot left VUK, pass to r.flipper, repeat. Value\n   starts at 6M and I believe you can collect it 6 or 8 times (I forget)\n   After xtreme combo the rest are not valuable enough to warrant\n   shooting so many drop targets. If you happen to get Xtreme multiball\n   then more power to you!\n\n   \n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Striker Xtreme", "possible_shots": "goal, locks, left VUK, right ramp, middle ramp, drop target, side ramp, jet booster (right loop)", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/strikerxtreme.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

It is based on my knowledge as a game owner and general pinball\nafficionado.  While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and\ncompleteness, errors may be present.  Please send any corrections or additions\nto paulsid@home.com and I will include them in a future update.\n\nI've based the layout of this rule sheet on all of the others I've read, so\nit may \"feel\" familiar.  The content might be excessive for such an old game,\nbut I only want to make one pass at this rule sheet and didn't want to leave\nany out.  This way I can limit future revisions to things I receive or\ndiscover.\n\nThis rule sheet uses pinball terminology and abbreviations commonly found\nalong the Internet. Lots of good resources are around if you don't know what\nsomething means.  To get you started, though, K is an abbreviation for 1000,\nand is used when describing the game's scoring.  EB is short for Extra Ball.\n\nI've gotten a bit technical in a few places, because I know how hard\ntechnical information is to find on older games.  If you're not interested in\nthe technical side of pinball, try to ignore these sections.\n\nLastly, I should note that when I got the game (which was thankfully free\nfrom a relative), it needed a lot of work, and while it's fully playable, my\nown game still doesn't work 100% correctly.  I have tried to note wherever this\nmay be a factor that affects the information in this rulesheet.\n\n  Game Overview  \n\nNot much to say here, really.  Stellar Wars is a classic space battle\npinball game for one to four players.  It has no multi-ball (though it does\nhave a captive ball),\n\n  Technical Information  \n\nStellar Wars was designed by Steve Ritchie and manufactured by Williams in\n1979.  It is a purely solid-state (electronic) game; there were no\nelectromechanical versions made.  I do not believe there were any \"home\nversions\" made (i.e. all games have pricing controls and coin slots.)\n\nMost games use Williams' System 4 electronics, but some newer versions of\nthe game were produced with System 6 electronics.\n\nThe game uses five 7-segment displays with 6 digits each, in a master/slave\nsetup.  The master board shows the credits remaining (digits 2-3) and current\nball number (digits 5-6).  Digits 1 and 4 are unused.  The four slave boards,\nas you might expect, show the scores for each of the four players.\n\nThe last ROM revision was L-2.  I would appreciate any information\nregarding the differences with the L-1 ROM, as I am only familiar with L-2.\n\nAbout the only really special thing in Stellar Wars is the large plastic\ninsert between the slingshots, which features two #89 flashlamps underneath.\nThe catalogue supplement says that these lamps were first used on Stellar Wars.\nI don't know too much about #89 bulbs, other than the fact they flash\nextraordinarily brightly when illuminated.  (Looks cool if you're playing in\nthe dark!)\n\n  Playfield Features  \n\nStellar Wars is a widebody design which in, typical Steve Ritchie fashion,\nkeeps the action towards the sides and top half of the playfield.  The lower\nhalf is fairly open with lots of room for the ball to travel unimpeded.\n\nEach feature of the playfield is described below.  I'll start from the\nplunger lane in the lower right and go around in a counter-clockwise spiral,\nending in the centre of the game.\n\n\n Plunger Lane  A standard manual plunger lane that runs up the entire right\nside of the playfield, exiting just above the Numbered Lanes.  A one-way gate\nthat is shared with the Right Lane (usually) prevents balls from returning to\nthe plunger.  A hard shot will travel through the Left Lane and down to the\nflippers. \n Numbered Lanes  Four lanes at the top of the playfield comprise the\nNumbered Lanes.  When the ball rolls down one of these lanes it spots the\nappropriate Number, from 1 (on the left) to 4 (on the right).  The lanes exit\nto the Jet Bumpers.\n Left Lane  A very short, curved lane on the left side of the playfield.\nA Spinner guards the entrance, which is even with the bottom of the Numbered\nLanes.  The lane exits above the Numbered Lanes, directly opposite the Plunger\nLange.  There is no one-way gate at the top, so hard shots from the Plunger\nLane will travel through the Left Lane, down to the flippers.\n Captive Ball  To the left and immediately beside the Left Lane is the\nCaptive Ball lane.  The ball rests roughly even with the Right Lane Spinner,\n2/3 of the way up the playfield.  The Captive Ball Target lies at the very top\nof the playfield, so a fairly solid shot is required to make the Captive Ball\nstrike the target.\n Eject Hole  To the left of the Captive Ball is the Eject Hole, which sits\nat the top of a short lane.  When the ball lands in the Eject Hole is it kicked\nback out to the Left Flipper.  A metal deflector lies above the Eject Hole,\nwhich, when properly adjusted, will keep most balls from bouncing out of the\nEject Hole prematurely.  When improperly adjusted, it will actually promote\nbounces out of the hole (see \"Bugs / Design Flaws\" chapter).\n Left Drop Targets  Below the Eject Hole lane, about midway up the\nplayfield, is a bank of three drop targets that face the right side of the\nplayfield.  The bottom target spots S, and the top target spots T.  The middle\ntarget has no special function on its own.\n Left Bumper  Just below the Left Drop Targets is a lone jet bumper.\n Left Outlane  Below the Left Bumper is the Left Outlane.  The Outlane can\nbe lit to score a Special.\n Left Inlanes  Beside the Left Outlane are two Left Inlanes.  The Inlane on\nthe left spots W, and the one on the right spots A.\n Flippers  Two standard length flippers in the usual layout.  There is no\ncentrepost between them.\n Right Inlanes  The Inlane on the left spots R, and the one on the right\nspots S.\n Right Outlane  Lies beside the Right Inlanes.  The Outlane can be lit to\nscore a Special.\n Right Bumper  Above the Right Inlanes and Right Outlanes is another lone\njet bumper.\n Standup Target  Just above the Right Bumper, facing the Left Flipper is a\nsingle Target.  Called the Bullseye Target on the game's Instruction\nCard.\n Right Lane  A short, curved lane that starts about 2/3 of the way up the\nplayfield and runs alongside the Plunger Lane.  The entrance is guarded by a\nSpinner.  The orbit exits via the same one-way gate as the Plunger Lane, just\nabove the Numbered Lanes.\n Right Drop Targets  Another bank of three Drop Targets sits nearly all the\nway up the playfield, below the one-way gate used for the Plunger and Right\nLanes.  Although there is a direct line to the Left Flipper, these Drop Targets\nare buried, so a clean shot is required.  The middle Drop Target spots\nR.\n Jet Bumpers  Below the Numbered Lanes are three Jet Bumpers arranged in\nthe classic triangular pattern (two on top, one on the bottom).  The ball can\nget tossed around quite a bit in the Jet Bumpers but is in no real danger of\ndraining, at least not directly.\n Centre Drop Targets  Below the Jet Bumpers, in what is essentially the\nexact centre of the playfield, is a bank of four Drop Targets.  The targets\nface the Left Flipper, at a classic angle that promotes drains out the Left\nOutlane.  Experienced pinball players will immediately recognize this angle.\nThe bank is situated up against the lowest of the Jet Bumpers.  Each target\nspots, from left to right, E-L-L-A.\n S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S  This is a series of lights found between the\nslingshots, in the centre of the playfield.  These lights show your progress\ntowards spelling S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S, the game's primary objective (see next\nchapter).\n Bonus Indicators  Another series of lights, right between the flippers.\nThese lights show your current Bonus Multiplier value in green, and the current\nBonus value in white.  (See the \"Bonus\" chapter.)\n Walls  Scattered throughout the playfield are seven switches inside the\nrubber walls of some of the obstacles that register small scores.  These\nswitches are located in the following places:  next to Left Lane entrance\n(two), next to Right Lane entrance, next to Right Drop Target bank, below\ncentre Jet Bumper on right side, behind Left Drop Targets, and behind Right\nDrop Targets.\n\n Objectives \n\nThere are several features of Stellar Wars that could be considered\nobjectives, and thus require a detailed explanation.  I consider objectives to\nbe anything that either has progressive awards or requires multiple shots to\ncomplete.\n\nNOTE:  Unless otherwise specified, all objectives reset at the beginning of\neach ball.\n\n S-T-E-L-L-A-R \n\nTo complete the word S-T-E-L-L-A-R, the player must hit the appropriate\nDrop Targets.  The Drop Targets to hit are indicated by lit Orange arrows.\nThese indicators are always on, and they do not move.  In fact, they are on a\nGI lighting circuit.\n\nThe letters S and T are located on the Left Drop Target bank, the letters\nE-L-L-A are on the Centre Drop Target bank, and the letter R is on the Right\nDrop Target bank.  The other three Drop Targets in the game do not spot\nletters, so only the Centre Drop Targets must be completed in order to spell\nS-T-E-L-L-A-R.\n\nLetters can also be spotted with the lit Captive Ball target.  A hit on the\nlit Captive Ball spots the next letter in sequence.  If S-T-E-L-L-A-R is\ncompleted, a letter in W-A-R-S will be spotted instead (see below).\n\nCompleting the word S-T-E-L-L-A-R awards a Bonus X.  More importantly,\nS-T-E-L-L-A-R is one half of the S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S objective of the game\n(see below).  Spotted letters will not reset until S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S is\ncompleted.  However, all Drop Targets will continue to function normally.\n\n W-A-R-S \n\nThe four inlanes (or return lanes) of the game each feature a letter in the\nword W-A-R-S, with W-A on the left and R-S on the right.  When the ball rolls\ndown an inlane it spots the letter.\n\nLetters can also be spotted with the lit Captive Ball target.  A hit on the\nlit Captive Ball spots the next letter in sequence, but only if S-T-E-L-L-A-R\nhas already been completed (see above).\n\nCompleting the word W-A-R-S awards a Bonus X, and is the other half of the\nS-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S goal described below.  Spotted letters will not reset\nuntil S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S is completed.\n\nCompleting W-A-R-S is not as easy as you might think, because there is no\nlane change feature like on modern machines.  Thus, you must get the ball to go\ndown each inlane at least once, and the game is often anything but cooperative.\nThe lit Captive Ball makes this job easier, but only if S-T-E-L-L-A-R is\nalready completed.\n\n S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S \n\nThe primary objective of Stellar Wars is to spot all of the letters in the\ngame's name.  This is done using the methods described above.\n\nCompleting both the words S-T-E-L-L-A-R and W-A-R-S awards 50K.  All\nletters are then immediately cleared so the goal can be achieved again.  There\nis no limit to the number of times S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S can be completed.\n\nNote that completing this objective does NOT reset the Drop Targets, so the\nLeft and Right banks must be completed at least once before their appropriate\nletter targets are available again.\n\nAn optional Sweep Sound (see \"Operator Adjustments\", #35) provides an\naudible indication of how close you are to completing S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S.\nIt functions kind of like a \"heartbeat\".  The more letters spotted, the faster\nthe \"beating\" gets.  This is a rather silly feature, but essentially harmless.\n\n Centre Drop Targets / Eject Hole / Outlanes \n\nCompleting the four targets in the Centre Drop Target bank increases the\nvalue of the Eject Hole.\n\nEject Hole awards are as follows:  1K, 2K, 5K, 10K, Extra Ball.\n\nOnce the Extra Ball award has been lit (though not necessarily collected),\nthe next completion lights the Outlanes for Special.  Only one Outlane Special\nmay be collected per ball; if somehow the ball is saved after going down an\nOutlane, the Special award on the other side will NOT be lit.\n\nAfter the Outlanes have been lit, no further awards are available, and the\nEject Hole remains valued at 10K once the Extra Ball has been collected.  Thus,\ncompleting the Centre Drop Targets will only award the 10K completion bonus.\n\nThis is the only way to get an Extra Ball in Stellar Wars (unless Special\nand/or Replay is set to award an Extra Ball), which arguably makes this\nobjective as important as completing S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S.\n\nIt is possible to light the Extra Ball and Outlanes at the same time, then\ndrain out an Outlane and collect a Special without collecting the Extra Ball.\n\nAn operator adjustment allows the 2K award to be skipped, thus reducing the\nnumber of completions needed to collect the later awards.  Another adjustments\nallows the Eject Hole awards to be held over or reset after each ball.  (Eject\nHole awards will always reset after the Extra Ball has been collected.)  See\n\"Operator Adjustments\", #27 & #33.\n\nNOTE:  My machine has two 5K playfield inserts, as opposed to a 2K and a\n5K.  Although it could have just been a substitution for a missing 2K insert,\nit could also be that the game included an extra 5K insert that could be\nswapped in for the 2K one when the operator setting to combine the two awards\nwas used.  I'd appreciate clarification on this.  (For the uneducated, inserts\nare the coloured hard plastic pieces that the lights under the playfield shine\nthrough.)\n\n Right Drop Targets \n\nEach time the bank of three Right Drop Targets are completed, a different\nfeature or award on the playfield is activated.\n\nThe first completion lights the Captive Ball target.  Subsequent Captive\nBall shots will score 10K and spot the next letter in S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S.\n\nThe second completion lights the Left and Right Bumpers, located at the\nbottom of the playfield.  When lit, each hit on either bumper scores 1K.\n\nThe third completion lights the Left and Right Spinners.  Each rotation of\na lit spinner scores 1K.\n\nThe fourth completion lights the Standup Target for a Special.\n\nNOTE:  An operator adjustment (#27) allows the Captive Ball and the Lower\nJet Bumpers to be lit with a single completion (see \"Operator Adjustments\").\n\nSubsequent completions do not light any further awards, but do award the\nbonus for completing the bank.\n\n Left Drop Targets \n\nThe Left Drop Targets are probably the least rewarding.  Completing the\nbank of three Drop Targets advances the value of the three Jet Bumpers on the\nupper half of the playfield.\n\nThe first completion lights the Jet Bumpers for 1K each.  The second\ncompletion will make the Jet Bumpers flash, and each hit will score 2K.\nSubsequent completions do not advance the Jet Bumpers any further, but still\naward a bonus for completing the bank.\n\n Numbered Lanes \n\nCompleting the Numbered Lanes (1-2-3-4) at the top of the playfield awards\na Bonus X and resets all four Numbered Lanes.  This award can be completed an\nunlimited number of times, though once the Bonus Multiplier reached 5X, no\nfurther Bonus X awards will count.\n\nThe currently spotted numbered lanes carry over from ball to ball.  The\nBonus Multiplier can also be configured to carry over (see \"Operator\nAdjustments\", #33 and the \"Bonus\" chapter).\n\n Scoring \n\n Targets / Shots \n\n\n Name               Score  When Lit  Bonus* \n Numbered Lanes     1K    N/A        1K \n Spinners           100     1K        0 \n Captive Ball       5K   10K+Letter  1K \n Eject Hole         1K     [1]       1K \n Drop Targets       1K     N/A       1K \n Inlanes            1K     N/A       1K \n Outlanes           2K   2K+Special  2K \n Upper Jet Bumpers  100    [2]        0 \n Lower Jet Bumpers  100    1K         0 \n Standup Target     2K   2K+Special   0 \n Slingshots         20?

My slingshots have never worked properly,\nhowever, and I've never had the time to fix them.  Clarification would\nbe appreciated.\n *  X represents a Bonus X, i.e. an increase in the Bonus Multiplier.  For\nmore information on the Bonus feature, see the next chapter.\n [1]  When lit, Eject Hole scores a progressive award of either:  1K, 2K, 5K,\n10K, or 10K+EB.  See \"Centre Drop Targets / Eject Hole / Outlanes\" in\nthe \"Objectives\" chapter above.\n [2]  When lit, Upper Jet Bumpers score 1K per hit.  When flashing, Upper Jet\nBumpers score 2K per hit.\n [3]  The Left Drop Target bank scores 5K for the first completion, 10K for\nthe 2nd completion, and 5K for each subsequent completion.\n [4]  The Right Drop Target bank scores 5K for the first completion, and\nincreases by 5K for each subsequent completion, up to a maximum of 30K\nfor the sixth completion.  Subsequent completions also score 30K.\n\n\n Bonus \n\nLike most games of its era, Stellar Wars has a Bonus award to help boost\nyour score.  The Bonus is awarded at the end of each ball.\n\nThe Bonus is tracked by a series of lights located between the flippers.\n\nThe Bonus Multiplier value progression is shown in green.  Only the highest\nvalue shown is awarded, so the maximum value is 5X.  In other words, if all\nfour lights are lit it means you have 5X, not the cumulative 14X.\n\nThe Bonus value is shown in white.  The maximum value is 29K.  To calculate\nyour bonus, take the highest single digit (1-9) shown and, if lit, add either\n10 or 20.  It's odd that you can't light both 10K and 20K at the same time, but\npresumably the designers felt that a 39K Bonus would be just too much.\n\nWhen your ball drains, as long as you haven't tilted, you receive your\nbonus.  The game will count off your bonus, repeating for each Bonus X.  The\ncounting is done fairly quickly, 1K at a time, with slight pauses between\nrepeats for Bonus X.\n\nThe Bonus Multiplier may or may not reset after each ball, depending on how\nthe game is setup (see \"Operator Adjustments\", #33).  It will always reset if\nyou achieve a 5X multiplier, however.\n\n Strategy \n\nThis chapter is all opinion based on experience, so don't blame me if it\ndoesn't work for you.  Do let me know if I am basing anything I say on\ninaccurate information, though.\n\nThere is not a lot of strategy involved in Stellar Wars.  In many ways this\nmakes it kind of endearing, because it is a purely technical game.  You\nbasically shoot for what you can see and react to the results, then repeat.\nThis makes Stellar Wars a great game to practices basic pinball playing\ntechniques like shot-making, catching, passing, nudging, etc.\n\nHaving said that, there are still a few objectives in the game that can be\napproached from a strategic point-of-view.  The two strategies I have adopted\nare the S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S strategy (which I'll call the Letters strategy\nfor brevity), and the Extra Ball strategy.\n\nThe Letters strategy involves trying to complete all of the letters in\nS-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S as fast as possible, then repeating.  It is fairly safe\nand a good way to practice shots at the drop targets.\n\nThe word S-T-E-L-L-A-R is somewhat easier to complete than W-A-R-S because\nyou can intentionally aim at the drop targets.  The inlanes required for\nW-A-R-S still require some luck to get the ball at the right target, even for a\ngood nudger (which admittedly I am not).  This is why I would recommend\ncompleting S-T-E-L-L-A-R, then completing the Right Drop Targets and lighting\nthe Captive Ball.  After this, you can shoot for the Captive Ball to spot the\nletters in W-A-R-S and collect the 50K award.\n\nThe Extra Ball strategy is a lot more perilous and probably best suited for\nexperienced players.  It involves simply pounding the Centre Drop Targets on\nthe way to lighting the Extra Ball at the Eject Hole.  The danger is that any\ndirect shot at the Centre Drop Targets is a potential drain shot, and it's very\ndifficult to hit them accidentally, so you have to be good at saving the ball.\nThe rewards involved are enormous, though, as you can theoretically repeat this\nstrategy indefinitely on each ball.\n\nOnce you have the Extra Ball, you can either try for S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S\n(which you should be close to completing by that time), or you can shoot for\nthe Eject Hole at 10K per shot (great if you're good at flipper passing).  I\nwouldn't recommend trying to light the Outlanes intentionally after lighting\nthe Extra Ball, unless you can do Death Saves or Bang Backs, because you have\nto drain to get the Special.  Odds are that ball action will do the job for\nyou in time.\n\nA third strategy is to simply fire the ball at the Left and Right Lanes\nwhenever possible, which keeps the ball away from the bottom half of the\nplayfield and thus relatively safe.  Remember, though, that the Upper Jet\nBumpers will send the ball off in any direction and that can make for some\nquick drains.  The key problem with this strategy is that there is little\nchance for reward.  The Bonus Multipliers you will get are not worth much\nwithout the Bonus to back them up, so you will eventually have to break down\nand shoot for something (Drop Targets are probably best as they offer quick\npoints).\n\nRegardless of which strategy you adopt, there are some points to remember.\nMost involve common pinball sense.\n\nThe Bonus is extremely valuable and will account for a significant part of\nthe score in a good game.  The maximum bonus you can get on a single ball is\n29K*5=145K.  Logically, if you achieve the maximum Bonus value (29K) at any\ntime, try like heck to increase the multiplier.  The safest way is by shooting\nthe Left or Right lane to the Numbered Lanes, but this can take a while.  A\nfaster but riskier way is to complete S-T-E-L-L-A-R W-A-R-S.  Similarly, if you\nmanage to get a couple of \"accidental\" Bonus X awards (from the Numbered Lanes\nor wherever), shoot at whatever you can to maximise your Bonus value.\n\nIf at any time you manage to complete W-A-R-S accidentally, it is worth\ntrying for S-T-E-L-L-A-R and the 50K award.  Similarly, if you find the Eject\nHole value at 10K, it's worth going for the Extra Ball.\n\nAlthough Stellar Wars has no Skill Shot per se, the same approach is\nrequired as if one existed.  In other words, DO _NOT_ JUST PULL THE PLUNGER ALL\nTHE WAY BACK AND FIRE!  All this will do is send the ball to the Left Flipper\nat high speed.  Instead, pull it back about half way and fire.  The ball should\nhit the wall beside the exit of the Left Lane and bounce around, going down one\nof the Numbered Lanes and into the Jet Bumpers.  Adjust for the plunger tension\nof the game you're playing on, of course.  This will put you this much closer\nto a Bonus X.  More advanced players can try to make an ad hoc Skill Shot over\ntime by learning the amount of plunger force required to put the ball in the\nNumbered Lane of their choice.  This is great as it virtually assures you an\nextra Bonus X by the end of your game.  It's free points, so why not?\n\nSpecials are not very useful no matter what they are set at, unless of\ncourse you don't own the game and had to pay to play it.  Othwerise, Credits\nare of no value other than bragging rights.  An Extra Ball isn't a bad award,\nbut the trouble is that Stellar Wars does not stack Extra Balls (i.e. only one\nper ball is allowed), so the if you use the Centre Drop Targets you will have\nalready lit the Extra Ball before the Outlane Specials.  The only real benefit\nis from the Right Drop Targets (which light a Special at the Standup Target)\nand they are not reasonably well scoring and divert your attention from other\nobjectives.\n\nIt's not too hard to keep the ball out of the Outlanes (even when the posts\nare set to Conservative (the hardest)) when they get near them.  Nudging\ntechniques should work most of the time, though the higher Inlane Dividers can\ncause problems.  The real frustration occurs when the ball travels from\nsomewhere on the top half of the playfield directly to the outlane mouth, at\nwhich time there isn't much you can do unless either a) you're really good or\nb) you can perform a Bang Back / Death Save.\n\nSpeaking of Bang Backs and Death Saves, I can't do them, so I can't say how\nStellar Wars is for practising them.  I can say that I often get quite a bit of\nball action after an outlane drain, so the potential may be there.  Tips\nregarding this are welcome.\n\nThe last thing I should mention is that I can envision Stellar Wars as a\ngreat game for kids.  It's space theme will keep them interested, and its\nrelative simplicity offers good potential for quick improvement with practice.\n\n Bugs / Design Flaws \n\nThis chapter outlines some of the things that I feel are bugs or design\nflaws in Stellar Wars.  Additions are welcome.\n\n Eject Hole Stop Bracket \n\nThe metallic tab that is fastened behind the Eject Hole was apparently a\nnew part for Stellar Wars.  Its job is to deaden the ball so it stays in the\nEject Hole.  Unfortunately, it's tough to adjust it properly so it does this,\nand even when properly adjusted it's still not 100% reliable.\n\nThe trick is to adjust it so that the height between the Eject Hole and the\nbottom of the Stop Bracket is as close to the ball clearance height as\npossible.  In other words, the ball should sit in the hole with the smallest\npossible gap between the ball and the Stop Bracket.\n\nAdjusting it too low, though, will prevent the ball from entering the hole\nentirely, so watch out.  Better too high than too low.  However, if too high,\nthe angle of deflection will not be sufficient to keep the ball in the hole,\nand the ball will just bounce back out.  It's touchy.\n\nI'm not really sure the Bracket was even designed to be adjustable, but it\ncan be done.  Make sure the screws holding it in place are tight, then secure a\npair of locking pliers to the end (facing the flippers) and bend gently until\nthe desired height is reached.  Regular pliers will also work, but may prove\nmore difficult when making fine adjustments.\n\nAdjusting my own bracket made a big difference to the number of\nbounce-outs.  On my machine, there is slightly less that a millimetre of space\nbetween the ball and the Bracket when the ball is sitting at rest in the Eject\nHole.  On hard shots directly to the Eject Hole, about 1 ball in 20 bounces\nout.  I've never had a light shot bounce out since the adjustment, but it's\nhard to get a light shot up there.\n\nIf you can't adjust the Bracket (because it's not your game or for whatever\nreason), it is not critical so long as the Bracket is high enough to let the\nball in.  Shots to the Eject Hole will still score, but the ball will bounce\nout immediately and can catch you off guard.  The danger is increased because\nthe Eject Hole Popper will fire about a half-second later, just as the ball is\nreturning to the flippers, and it's hard to ignore it.\n\n Drop Targets Fail to Score \n\nIf you hit a Drop Target immediately after completing a different Drop\nTarget bank, the Drop Target won't score, or at the very least won't spot the\nletter if one is associated with it.  This can get frustrating at times because\nit forces you to complete an entire bank just to have another shot at spotting\nthe letter.  (Does this happen on System 6 games?)\n\n Operator Adjustments \n\nThis chapter describes the various operator adjustments available on\nStellar Wars.  I provide this chapter for two reasons:  1) To let players who\ndon't own the game know what might be different, and 2) To help owners who\nmight not have a manual.  I have intentionally kept this chapter brief, as\neverything here is covered in the manual (plus I don't want to infringe on\ncopyrights.)  HINT:  I've listed all settings in order.\n\n\nNumber | Description\n-------+---------------------------------------------------------------\n00-11  | Audits.\n12     | Current High Score.\n13     | Backup High Score (used after a reset).\n14-17  | Replay Scores.\n18     | Maximum Credits (up to 30, 0 is free play).\n19-25  | Pricing Controls.\n26     | Number of Credits awarded for a High Score.\n27     | Eject Hole 2K/5K and Captive Ball/Lower Bumper Lit separation.\n       | (Eject separate & others together, both together, both\n       | separate, or 2K/5K together and others separate.)\n28     | Match toggle.\n29     | Special award (Credit, Extra Ball, 50K).\n30     | Replay award (Credit, Extra Ball).\n31     | Number of balls (3 or 5).\n32     | Maximum number of tilts before ball loss.\n33     | Playfield Restore.

Any additional information, comments, or\ncorrections should be sent to Dave Stewart.\n\nThis rule compilation and tips sheet is, to the extent possible (in light\nof the subject matter being the property of Premier/Gottlieb), public domain.\n\nI use the abbreviations \"K\" for a thousand points, \"M\" for a million points,\nand \"B\" for a billion points.\n\nGENERAL\nStreet Fighter II (commonly abbreviated SFII or SF2 in Usenet posts) is a\npinball machine designed by Premier/Gottlieb in cooperation with Capcom, and\nreleased in early 1993.  It's theme is based on the popular video game of the\nsame name.\n\nThe pin is of standard (24\") width. Its playfield has two ramps, standard\ntriangular slingshots above each flipper, one inlane and one outlane on each\nside, and a dot-matrix display.  The first thing you see (or at least that I\nsaw) when looking at the playfield are all the 1.5-in diameter circles which\nidentify all of your shots; not much original artwork there.  The machine has\nfive flippers, but when you first look at it you'll probably only see three:\nthe two standard flippers and a third full-size flipper half way up the\nleft-hand side of the playfield, facing sideways.  A fourth flipper is in a\nmini-playfield under the main playfield, and is only activated during a Car\nCrunch.  The fifth flipper is at the top of the right ramp, and it rotates at\nconstant velocity whenever the right ramp is in the lowered position; you have\nno control of this flipper.\n\nIn case you forget, the machine will tell you, \"use the flipper!\"  There are\nseveral other quotes in the game, but I don't care to remember them (most are\npretty lame) and it gives you something to discover on your own when playing\nthe game :-).\n\nThe main gimmick is an upper mini-playfield, accessible only via the right\nramp. The rotating flipper tries to intercept any ball shot up the right ramp\nfrom reaching the habitrail on the left.\n\nTHE SHOTS\nThis is a glossary of the shots that will be referred to during the discussion\nof the game.  In SFII, most shots correspond to one or two of the opponents\nthat you must defeat through the course of the game.  There are only 8 shots\nfor 12 opponents, as the lower right sink hole and the spiral each have two\nopponents, and the left and right ramps can be raised and lowered, with one\nopponent for each ramp position.\n\n\n Lower Left sink hole  This is the opponent E.Honda.  When the opponent is\nnot lit, this hole spots a letter in TORPEDO.  Completing TORPEDO\nstarts TORPEDO Multiball.\n\n Lower Right sink hole  This hole has two opponents: M. Bison and Balrog.\nWhen neither of the opponents are lit, then the hole spots 1 letter in\nTORPEDO until the first TORPEDO multiball is achieved, and scores\n1M + 1M to ??, and resets on each ball.\n\n Left lane, just past top flipper This hole is the opponent Blanka. When\nthe opponent is not lit, it advances the Car Crunch value. On our\nmachine you need 3 hits to get the Car Crunch, but this is probably\neither a self-adjusting value or operator settable.\n\n Left ramp  This is the opponent Zangief.  The left ramp can be raised,\nin which case refer to the \"left underpass\" described below. When the\nopponent is not lit, and the ramp is in the lowered position, this shot\nscores 3M.  Any ball shot up this ramp is kicked out of the E.Honda hole.\nYou can also get Zangief by shooting Sagat just as multiball ends if\nZangief is lit (bug or feature?).  Shooting an unlit Zangief raises the\nramp for a shot at an unlit Sagat.\n\n Left underpass  This is the opponent Sagat.  This shot is only active\nwhen the left ramp is in the raised position. When the opponent is not lit,\nthis shot is worth 4M, and kicks 1 barrel.  Kick 4 barrels to start\nMultiball. Any ball shot through this underpass is kicked out of the\nE.Honda hole.\n\n Left sinkhole, just to right of left ramp  This is the opponent Dhalsim.\nWhen the opponent is not lit, then this shot scores the flame, which is\n2M.  Any ball shot into this sinkhole is kicked out of the E.Honda hole.\n\n Vertical loopback, just to right of pop bumper  This is the opponent\nGuile, one of the toughest shots in the game because it has a very small\nsweet spot.  This shot loops the ball up vertically onto a habitrail which\ndrops the ball into the right inlane.  When this opponent is not lit, it\nspots a letter in GUILE.  Spelling GUILE the first time gives and extra\nball (or 50M if extra-balls are disabled), and scores 50M for each\ncompletion of the GUILE.  Although the shot is obviously made for the left\nflipper, it is possible to hit this shot backhanded from the right\nflipper.  I have done the backhand several times while the ball was\nheading towards the right flipper from the left side of the playfield,\nbut only once when the ball was at rest on the right flipper.\n\n Spiral in upper right corner This shot has 2 opponents: Ken and Ryu.\nIt is designed to be hit from the upper left flipper only, although a ball\nfrom the right flipper which hits a post just above E.Honda may ricochet\ninto the spiral.  I've done this a few times, but never intentionally.\nAlthough both opponents light up together, each shot when it is lit scores\nonly one of the two opponents.  When not lit, this scores 1M+1M per loop.\nA good shot might give you 3 or 4 loops, but usually you'll only get 1 or 2\nloops.  The value continues to increase across balls.  Any ball shot in the\nspiral is kicked out of the M.Bison hole.\n\n Right ramp This shot is the opponent Chun Li. Like the left ramp, this\nshot is only active when the ramp is in the lower position.  A shot up this\nramp sends the ball to a raised playfield, which has a single flipper that\nis rotating at constant speed (you have no control of this flipper).  If\nthe flipper does not hit the ball, then your ball goes straight to a\nhabitrail on the left, which drops the ball into the left inlane, and you\nscore either Chun Li when it is lit, or 5M+5M to 25M if not lit, which\nresets on each ball.  Note that after you get an unlit Chun-li, you have\none shot from the left flipper to get the next ramp.  If you hit any other\nswitch, the ramp raises, and gives you a shot at an unlit Vega.  If the\nrotating flipper does hit the ball, then it either sends it back down the\nramp, or onto the right habitrail, which drops the ball into the right\ninlane.  In this case, no points, touch bananas, zilch, and the machine\nlaughs at you!  Hidden discovery: you can also get Chun Li by shooting Vega\njust as Multiball ends when Chun Li is lit (bug or feature?).\n\n Right underpass  This is the opponent Vega.  This shot is only active when\nthe right ramp is raised.  When the opponent is not lit, this shot scores a\nrandom award.  Some of the possibilities include points (5-25M), light\nextra ball, start regular multiball, and spot letters in 1 to all letters\nin GUILE, TORPEDO, or FIGHTER.  There may be other awards too.  If you hit\nthe unlit Vega when the DOUBLE light is on, then it gives you TWO separate\nrandom awards.  This shot sends the ball to an eject hole which feeds the\ntop pop bumper.  During normal play, the ramp can be raised for a random\nunlit Vega award in two ways:  1) Hit an unlit Chun-Li, or 2) have the ball\nland into the Vega eject hold by going through the green targets (usually a\nlucky bounce off the Jet Bumpers).  If the right ramp is stuck in the up\nposition, then the right underpass will give you credit for Chun-Li when\nlit, otherwise it will give you a random award every time.\n\n\nThe remaining shots do not have any opponents associated with them.\n\n\n Skill Shot, step 1, the timed plunger shot  The dot matrix display,\naccompanied by Chun Li's voice, says \"Ready, Set, Shoot\".  After it says\nshoot, you let go of the plunger, which sends the ball up a habitrail.  At\nthe end of the rails is a sensor, which sets your starting bracelet value.\nAfter you hit the sensor, the ball dribbles down into the Blanka eject\nhole, and the display goes into a shoot the bullseye animation, and tells\nyou if you were early or late for a bullseye.  If you timed the shot just\nright, you get the bullseye, and you set the initial bracelet to 20M.  If\nyou are off, the initial value is 5M, 10M, or 15M, depending on how close\nyou are.  To score any skill shot points, you must get the skill shot step\n2.  If Blanka is lit, then you also defeat Blanka [but if it is not lit, do\nyou advance the car crush count?]\n\n Skill Shot, step 2, hitting the Bracelet  The bracelet is a target just\nabove the entrance of Ken&Ryu.  It is a plastic target with a metal pin in\nthe center.  To get the skill shot points, you must hit this target from\nthe upper left flipper as the ball is fed out of Blanka.  If you hit the\ncenter of the target, which is detected by hitting the you get double the\npoints.  If you miss the target, then the bracelet becomes a \"Hurry Up\"\ntarget, counting down from the original value to 0.\n\n Extra Ball (EB) target this target is near the back center of the\nplayfield.  The EB target is the white one, which is between two red\ntargets.  Hitting this target while the purple light is flashing awards an\nextra ball.  There are various ways to light this target, but the target\nonly stays lit for about 10-15 seconds.  Note that you must hit the white\ncenter target, and not the side red targets to get the EB.  Also, there\nis no grace period on hitting the target after the light stops flashing.\nThe target is pretty much worthless if hit when not lit.\n\n Green Targets In back of the EB target, there is a single pop bumper, and\nthree plastic targets, which are called the \"Green Targets\" because of the\ngreen lights in front of them on the playfield.  By hitting all three\ntargets a certain number of times, you light the EB target for 10-15\nseconds.  It is not clear how often you have to complete the 3 hits, or\nwhether they must be hit in waves, but it seems like 2 or 3 times, and\ncould very well be self-adjustable or operator settable.  You can light the\nEB many times in a game in this way.\n\n Fighter Targets These are two targets just to the left of the right ramp,\nfacing sideways.  Every time you complete both targets, you spot a\nletter in FIGHTER, which is shown by red LED's to the left of the plunger.\nSpelling FIGHTER lights special, which is flipper selectable among\nthe inlanes and outlanes.\n\n\nOther things to know about the playfield:\n\n\n Slingshots SFII has the traditional slingshots above the lower flippers.\nThey don't score anything significant (except for affecting the last\n2 digits of the score), except during TORPEDO Multiball when they\nare worth 3M a pop (along with everything else!)\n\n Double Light Every shot has a red 'double' light on it, which is normally\nnot lit, but does light up on various occasions:\n\n unlit opponent: Whenever 'double' is lit for an unlit-opponent, you score\ndouble the value of that shot.  For example, E.Honda spots 2 letters in\nTORPEDO instead of 1, Guile spots 2 letters in GUILE, Sagat kicks 2\nbarrels, Zangief scores 6M (although the display still only shows 3M),\nVega gives you 2 random awards.  Every time you hit the slingshot or\npop bumper, which unlit opponent has the 'double' lit changes.  You\nstart the game with only one unlit opponent having 'double' lit, but at\nsome point in the game I did end up with 2 at a time; I'm not sure how\nI got that second one.\n double round:  During the double round, the 'double' light for each shot\nthat must be completed to double your score is lit.  As you hit them,\nthe light goes out, so that when you hit the last one that is lit,\nyou double your score (if time didn't run out first!)\n\n\n Inlanes & Outlanes  there are no significant value to the inlanes and\noutlanes in SFII, except after completing FIGHTER, in which one of the\nlanes is lit for SPECIAL.  You can use the flipper to alternate which of\nthe four lanes is lit.\n\n Second Chance  if you drain within the first 10 or so seconds of play\nand before you defeat any opponent, the game gives you the ball back, and\nsays \"Shoot Again\" as though you had an extra ball.  You do not get to do\nthe skill shot again, but the bracelet does remain lit and counting down\nfrom your previous skill shot (at most 10 seconds earlier!).\n\n\nGAME PLAY\nThe object of the game is to defeat each of the 12 opponents.  You defeat an\nopponent by making the appropriate shot when the white light with the\nopponent's name is on.  In normal settings before the first Champion Challenge,\nthere are always 3 opponents lit at a time, starting with E.Honda, M.Bison,\nand Sagat.  Every time you defeat an opponent, you get a choice of prizes,\nwhich is selectable by the flippers.  The choices are the following:\n\n\nopponent defeatedleft flipper selectsright flipper selects\n 1st  \t 5M\t\t  Car Crunch         \n 2nd  \t 5M\t\t  Multiball          \n 3rd    5M\t\t  Roaming Ninjas     \n 4th   10M\t\t  Multiball          \n 5th   Hurry Up EB/10M\t  Count Up           \n 6th   Add 3 to TORPEDO  \tMultiball     \n 7th    10M\t\t  1-2 Punch          \n 8th   Add 2 to GUILE\t  Multiball          \n 9th    10M\t\t  Double Score round \n10th  Complete FIGHTER\t  Multiball          \n11th  no prize; display message only\n12th  CHAMPION CHALLENGE\n\n\nThe points are obvious, but for the big prize money always select the\nchoice that is not points, and when available, always select Multiball.\nIf you don't select any within 5 seconds, the game picks one for you,\nwhich is always the left flipper choice.\n\nEach of the above choices are described in detail below.\n\n\nCAR CRUNCH   The car crunch is a mini-playfield under the main playfield,\nwhich has a single full-sized flipper, a ball, and a car which crunches up\nas you hit it.  The object of the car crunch is to completely crunch up the\ncar by hitting it multiple times, before running out of time.  It takes\nanywhere from 2 to 5 hits to crunch the car, depending on how strong you\nhit the car.  The amount of time you have depends on which round of the car\ncrunch you are on.  I'm not sure exactly, but you get about 1M per car\nhit.  If you succeed in crunching the car, a white light in the\nmini-playfield which says \"winner\" lights up, and you also get the Car\nCrunch bonus.  The bonus for the first round is 5M (3M on tournament\nsettings), and you have about 8 seconds, which is about 3 times longer than\nyou need.  The bonus on the second round is 10M, and you have about 5-6\nseconds.  The bonus on the third and subsequent rounds is 30M, and you only\nhave about 2-3 seconds.  Note that you only advance to the next bonus level\nwhen you successfully complete the car crunch.  In addition to obtaining\nthe car crunch as an award for defeating the first opponent, it can also be\nobtained by making several shots to the unlit Blanka.\n\nROAMING NINJAS  During the roaming ninjas round, the 8 shots (with ramps\nin raised position) are randomly lit, 2 shots at a time (one on the left\nhalf of the playfield, and the other on the right half), for 5 seconds each\npair.  During this round, aim for any lit shots.  The first lit shot scores\n5M, the second scores 20M, the third 50M, and the fourth 100M.  Sorry, even\nif you are fast, there is no fifth shot.  When you get a lit shot, that\nshot still stays lit for the remainder of its 5 seconds, so it is possible\nto get the same shot twice (which I've often done with E.Honda and M.Bison,\nwhere you can send a kicked out ball right back into the hole.)\n\nHURRY UP EB   The first time through (i.e. before getting the Champion\nChallenge once), the extra ball target lights up for about 10-15 seconds.\nThe second time through (i.e. after a Champion Challenge) or if\nextra balls are disabled, your choice is 10M, not the Hurry Up EB.\n\nCOUNT-UP   In this round, the lower right hole (M.Bison) lights up, with\nthe inverse of a \"Hurry-Up\" feature.  The value of the hole starts at 3M\nand increases by 100K up to 10M, pauses, then increments quickly by 1M to\n48M.  No grace period; if you miss the highest value by a millisecond you\nget nothing.\n\n1-2 PUNCH   For the 1-2 punch you must complete Blanka then Ken&Ryu in that\norder, within about 20 seconds.  The first time you get the 1-2 punch,\nyou get an Extra Ball for completing the two shots.  On subsequent times,\nor if the EB is disabled, then you get 25M for Blanka, then 50M for\nKen&Ryu. [or is it 10M for Blanka and 25M for Ken&Ryu??]\n\nDOUBLE SCORE  In this round, you must hit the four lit shots within 20\nseconds to double your score.  The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shots score 5M, 10M,\nand 15M respectively.  The 4th shot doubles your score. This is not easy to\ndo, because the machine picks the hardest shots to hit: among the four\nshots, you usually have to hit Guile, Ken&Ryu, or both.\n\n\nMULTIBALL\nThe regular multiball is a progressive jackpot multiball, where each jackpot\nyou score increases the value of the next jackpot.\n\nFor every second opponent you defeat (excluding the 12th opponent) one of your\nchoices is to start multiball (which is usually the recommended choice!).  You\ncan also get multiball by kicking all barrels via an unlit Sagat or as a random\naward via unlit Vega.  During multiball, you want to shoot a flashing opponent\nto score a jackpot.  There are 8 possible jackpots, one for each shot (the\nramps are always in the raised position during multiball, so you always shoot\nthe underpass). Two jackpot shots are flashing at a time.  When you hit a\njackpot, that shot stays lit (but not flashing) and another one lights up, so\nthat you always have two shots to shoot for, except for when you only have the\nlast jackpot left.\n\nThe jackpot values are worth 5M, 10M, 15M, 20M, 25M, 30M, and 35M for the first\nseven jackpots respectively.  The eighth jackpot (or Super Jackpot) is worth\n300M.  In normal settings, once you get the super jackpot during multiball, you\ncan keep shooting it for 300M a pop, until you lose that Multiball.  In hard\n(tournament??) settings, after you hit the super jackpot once, you must restart\nwith the first 5M jackpot.\n\nYou do not have to get all jackpots in the same multiball, as the jackpots\nalready obtained and the jackpot value are carried from multiball to multiball.\n\nThe jackpot shots always light up in the same order, starting with E.Honda and\nM.Bison/Balrog.  The next one is Sagat if you hit E.Honda first, or Vega if you\nhit M.Bison/Balrog first.  The fourth is Sagat or Vega, whichever wasn't lit\nthird.  The next four are always, in order, Dhalsim, Blanka, Guile, and\nKen&Ryu.\n\nSTRATEGY: Since the 8th jackpot is worth the most, and it is the only one\nthat you hit more than once, it is wise to stay away from shooting an easy\njackpot (e.g. Vega, Sagat, or Dhalsim) and concentrate on always going\nfor the more difficult shots (e.g. Blanka, Guile, and Ken&Ryu).  If the\nshot you have remaining for the super jackpot is something like Sagat,\nthen you can reshoot that target numerous times for 300M a shot.  Whereas\nif you have Guile or Ken&Ryu, it may be difficult to get more than one\nsuper jackpot.\n\nIf you start a multiball when the Blanka jackpot is lit, you will get that\njackpot automatically, as the plunger shot deposits the ball into the Blanka\neject hole.\n\nOnce you've gotten the super jackpot, and that multiball ends, the next\nmultiball starts from the beginning again, as though it was your first\nmultiball.\n\nTORPEDO MULTIBALL\nThe torpedo multiball is a 3-ball Frenzy Multiball, where every switch is worth\n3M.  You get the TORPEDO Multiball by completing the word TORPEDO.  One letter\nis spotted in TORPEDO each time you hit E.Honda when not lit or M.Bison when\nnot lit and before the first TORPEDO Multiball; two letters if the 'double'\nlight is on when you hit E.Honda or M.Bison, or 3 letters if you select \"add 3\nto TORPEDO\" after defeating the 6th opponent.\n\nWhen there is only one letter remaining in TORPEDO to start the Multiball, the\nE.Honda hole will be flashing, and the M.Bison hole also if it is the first\nTORPEDO multiball.  If you get this, you get the TORPEDO multiball.  You can\nalso get TORPEDO multiball by hitting E.Honda or M.Bison when the \"double\"\nlight is on and only 2 letters remaining, or by adding 3 letters after\ndefeating the 6th opponent.\n\nAn average TORPEDO multiball should score you 100M.  With a good multiball,\nyou can really rack up multi-millions of points.\n\nThe TORPEDO multiball score is the only End-of-ball bonus in the game.  So once\nyou get this, DON'T TILT!\n\nSTRATEGY: One strategy that I have found works quite well is to pick two shots,\none on the right and one on the left, and just keep hitting those same shots\nrepeatedly.  I usually aim for Sagat and Vega.  The Sagat shot is a fairly easy\nshot which takes a ball off the playfield for a few seconds so that you only\nhave to deal with one or two balls at a time, and it passes by 3 switches for\n9M a shot (as opposed to E.Honda or Dhalsim, which only register 1 or 2\nswitches per hit).  The Vega shot feeds the top pop bumper, which in\ncooperation with the green targets, will often give you at least five target\nhits (i.e.  15M) per shot.  You also might light extra ball by continuously\nshooting it there.\n\nCHAMPION CHALLENGE\nStreet Fighter II is a goal-oriented pin, and the goal is to become the new\nmaster.  You do that by first defeating all 12 opponents, which puts you into\nthe champion challenge, then defeating all 12 opponents a second time on the\nsame ball.  If you successfully complete the challenge, you get 500M, Special,\nand you become the new MASTER (the machine asks you to enter your initials).\n\nDuring the Champion Challenge, all 8 shots are lit simultaneously.  As you\ndefeat an opponent, that light goes out.  Shooting the lower right hole once\ndefeats both M.Bison and Balrog; shooting the spiral once defeats both Ken and\nRyu.  Shooting Zangief raises the ramp and exposes Sagat.  Shooting Chun-Li\nraises the ramp and exposes Vega.  Therefore to defeat 12 opponents, you\nneed 10 shots.\n\nOnce you complete the Champion Challenge, you start over having to defeat\nopponent 1, and you get the choices for each opponent defeated.  The second\ntime around, though, only two opponents are lit at a time, and not three as the\nfirst time around.  I haven't gotten to a 2nd Champion Challenge, so I don't\nknow if the third time around you only have one opponent lit at a time.\n\nIf you lose the ball during Champion Challenge, then you lose out on that\n500M, and you must start all over on the next ball.\n\nREPLAYS AND HIGH SCORES\n\nREPLAY SCORE  As with all modern machines, the replay score is self-adjusting.\nThe following algorithm seems to be used in SFII (these are the default\nsettings on our machine, I presume some of the parameters are operator\nadjustable):  You can beat the replay score 3 times on your credits without\nthe replay score changing.  After that, it increases by 50M per game,\nregardless of whether or not you get credits, until your credits run down\nto 0.  It's sort of like the machine deciding that you've played long\nenough, and it wants to kick you off.  After the credits go down to zero,\nthe base replay score is reset.  On the machine I played, it seemed like\nGottlieb/Premier finally got their algorithm working properly, after those\nscrew ups in Cue Ball Wizard where the replay score was boosted to the\nBillions!  However, some people have seen the bug on their SF2's, so maybe\nit is a matter of different ROMs.  On our local machine the base replay\nvalue fluctuated between about 100M and 250M.\n\nHIGH SCORES  The high scores on our machine ranged are all around 1B,\nand one Usenet post said that Rick Stetta got 4.6B on it.  Our machine does\nnot give you any credits for getting a high score, and only gives you 1\ncredit for achieving the grand champion score.  I'm not sure if this is\nstandard or just a local operator setting.\n\nTHE MASTER  The game keeps track of the \"Master\", which is the last person\nto have completed the Champion Challenge.  See CHAMPION CHALLENGE\ndescription above.  You get one credit for completing the challenge and\nbecoming the new master.\n\nSPECIALS   The special lights on the inlanes and outlanes are lit when\nFIGHTER is completed.  The lit lane can be rotated by using the flippers.\nAlthough I've never seen it, but I imagine that you can also get the\nSpecial as a random award from an unlit Vega.  I haven't been able to\nconfirm this, but it has been mentioned that the lit lane can only\nbe rotated to the right, using alternate flippers.  I didn't notice this\nwhen I played, and there are no more SF2's around here for me to check on.\nIt might also be ROM dependent.\n\n\nI hope you find this rule sheet valuable.  I've found the rule sheets written\nby others (Thanks K&K!) to be really useful, so I hope that this is just one\nof many contributions I can make in return.  If you have any corrections,\nplease forward them to me.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Street Fighter II", "possible_shots": "Lower Left sink hole, Lower Right sink hole, Left lane just past top flipper, Left ramp, Left underpass, Left sinkhole just to right of left ramp, Vertical loopback just to right of pop bumper, Spiral in upper right corner, Right ramp, Right underpass, Skill Shot step 1 the timed plunger shot, Skill Shot step 2 hitting the Bracelet, Extra Ball (EB) target, Green Targets, Fighter Targets", "manufacturer": "Premier/Gottlieb", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/streetfighter2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Street Fighter II", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

rulesheet for the 1992 Super Mario Bros pinball machine\n   produced by Gottlieb in April 1992.\n\n   I'll start with a brief description of the playfield from the bottom\n   to the top.\n\n   Flippers...(3) the third being at the top of the playfield on a\n   separate raised section...but i'll get to that later.\n\n   In/Outlanes...standard in/outlanes...with a Kick Save on the left\n   outlane.\n\n   Slingshots...standard slingshots.\n\n   Drop Targets...Well none as such...but the shield between the flippers\n   works on the same principle as a drop target.\n\n   Sink Holes...(4) one each side of the playfield just above the\n   slingshots....one above the third flipper on the raised platform at\n   the top of the playfield.....and the  other being just in front of the\n   \"Castle\" at the top right of the playfield...this hole has a plastic\n   tube that runs down to the bottom right hole just above the right\n   slingshot.\n\n   Pop Bumpers...(3)\n\n   Ramps...(1) one ramp on the left side of the playfield...which leads\n   to the raised platform at the top.\n\n   Wireform ramp...this ramp leads from the top hole...and runs down the\n   side of the playfield and drops the ball in the left\n   inlane.....there's also a moulded plastic ramp which begins from the\n   raised platform at the top of the playfield...and drops the ball into\n   the right inlane.\n\n   Spot Targets...(5)...all targets have multiple functions...and will be\n   explained later.\n\n   Loop Shot...there's a tunnel running under the moulded plastic ramp on\n   the right hand side of the playfield....and it feeds the ball back\n   into the pop bumpers in the middle of the playfield.\n\n   Castle...A blue plastic revolving castle sits at the top of the\n   playfield...just behind the top sink hole...it doesn't do anything\n   besides spin around at times...but it looks pretty cool.\n\n\n   Object of the game\n\n   The main object of this game is to save the princess....which involves\n   destroying 7 castles...each castle is destroyed by becoming \"Super\" in\n   which the player then proceeds to shoot for the castle.....\n\n   All castles destroyed are carried over to the next game...so it's\n   possible to start a game with the 6 castles already destroyed...and\n   only having to destroy one more to receive the replay and put your\n   initials up...\n\n   The game also consists of 6 \"rounds\"...to start a round the player\n   must light 3 shells...by hitting the spot targets or ramp shots where\n   the shells are lit....hitting the pop bumpers toggles the lights to\n   different shots.\n\n   Once the 3 shells are lit...the player must get the \"key\"...By getting\n   the ball in one of the 3 holes with the key lamp lit.\n\n   Once the key has been gathered...the player is given the option of\n   choosing a round with the flippers....2 rounds are picked randomly by\n   the machine...and the player must decide in a few secands...otherwise\n   the machine will pick the round on the left flipper and start\n   automatically.\n\n   Here's a description of all the  rounds.....\n\n   bomb round...\n   Light the fuse by hitting the left  ramp spot target while\n   flashing...after doing so....shoot the ball into  one of the holes to\n   score 30 million  points....also...the upper playfield  hole stays lit\n   to score 20 million points for the rest of the ball! \\p\n\n   Yoshi's countdown round\n   Hit Yoshi's spot target on the upper playfield to collect the\n   countdown value....it starts at 24 million....the value does not\n   countdown during multiball.\n\n   Luigi's cave countup round\n   Luigi's cave is located under the raised part of the playfield at the\n   top of the table...hit the cave spot  targets to collect the count up\n   value....(stops at 48 million)\n\n   Castle extra ball round\n   Enter the castle during this round to collect an extra ball\n\n   Exclamation round\n   Hit the \"!\" targets to collect increasingly higher scores...the scores\n   range from...1.2 3 5 and 10 million....the  best scoring round...\n\n   Mega bumper round\n   Hit each pop bumper to score 1  million\n\n   NOTE...Entering a round while  super mario doubles the value of the\n   round...including extra balls...\n\n   Multiball\n\n   Super Mario bros is a 3 ball game....to achieve multiball...you must\n   light \"1.2.3.4\" in sequence...\"1\" is the left ramp....\"2\" is the Yoshi\n   target...\"3\" is the right loop shot that feeds  the ball back into the\n   bumpers...\"4\" is the shot made from the upper left  flipper...into the\n   moulded ramp that feeds the ball into the right inlane......once\n   these shots are made...you have to hit the ball into the bottom left\n   hole....\n\n   There's 2 or 3 ball multiball...3  ball is gained by being\n   \"Super\"....the object of multiball is to get as many balls in the\n   castle as possible....each ball in the castle earns a\n   jackpot....jackpots start at 5 million....and progress to 10,20 and\n   finally 40 million\n\n\n   General gameplay\n\n   Below is a description of scoring  values and features for all the\n   targets/bumpers etc.....\n\n   Slingshots...score 90 points and toggle turtle shells when not in a\n   round.\n\n   Pop bumpers...score 3000  or 1 million if in mega bumpers\n   round....they also toggle turtle shells when not in a round.\n\n   Upper playfield hole...scores  200,000 or 20 million when\n   flashing...(after defeating bomb round)...also  scores \"!\" value when\n   in \"!\" round.....and finally awards \"quick pick\"  when key is\n   flashing.\n\n   Upper playfield spot target (Yoshi)...scores  3000 points...and adds\n   500,000 to Yoshi bonus....(Yoshi bonus is collected  when the ball is\n   drained...and carries over to the next ball)........flash  \"feather\"\n   target for a time if not in a round (feather target scores 5\n   million)........hitting the Yoshi target twice in a row when not in a\n   round  lights it for 3 million the next time it's hit.......also\n   hitting the Yoshi  target when in Yoshi countdown round collects the\n   displayed bonus....and  last of all...advance \"1.2.3.4\" when 2 is lit.\n\n   Right ramp...scores 100,000  when Mario is normal...or 500,000 when\n   Mario is \"Super\"........complete  \"1.2.3.4\" when 4 is\n   flashing.....score \"!\" value when in \"!\" round.....advance S-U-P-E-R\n   when lit.\n\n   Pop bumper spot targets...score  30,000 points....score \"!\" value when\n   in \"!\" round.....advance shells when  lit.\n\n   Left ramp...scores 3000 unlit....scores  \"quick shot\" value when\n   flashing (quickshot is activated when the ball  passes through the\n   right inlane....by shooting for the left ramp...an increasing bonus is\n   given...the bonus increases as such....1,2,5,7 million,extra ball,10\n   million).....advance \"1,2,3,4\" when 1 is flashing....score \"!\" value\n   when  in \"!\" round.\n\n   Left hole...scores 50,000......toggle  turtle shells when not in a\n   round....award bonus chance when lit....(bonus  chance is a 3 wheel\n   slot machine....and the bonus works like this....zilch  scores\n   200,000...\"? ? cherry\" scores 1 million...\"? cherry cherry\" scores  2\n   million...any 3 mushrooms scores 2 million....3 of a kind scores 5\n   million....and  three 7's scores 200 million!!)..........advance\n   S-U-P-E-R when flashing....award  quick pick when key is\n   flashing......award multiball when lit.\n\n   Left ramp spot target...score  100,000 or 5 million when\n   flashing....become super mario if fast flashing......light  fuse\n   during bomb round when flashing.\n\n   Cave spot targets...score  30,000 or award extra ball when\n   flashing.....collect Luigi's count up bonus  when in count up\n   round....light bonus chance if not in a round.\n\n   Left inlane...scores 50,000....advance bullet sequence....( the bullet\n   sequence is a set of 4 lamps in front of  the castle....by lighting\n   the 4 bullets...an easy shot to the castle will begin video mode...see\n   below for details)\n\n   Right inlane...scores 50,000.....flash  quick shot when lamp is lit.\n\n   Left outlane...scores 200,000  unlit....if Mario is super and kick\n   save has been used...go back to being normal mario.\n\n   Right outlane...scores 200,000.\n\n   Castle...scores 500,000  unlit....collect jackpot when in\n   multiball....collect extra ball when in  castle extra ball\n   round....collect special when flashing...(special is  gained by\n   completing all 6 rounds...and is lit for a limited time)......destroy\n   a castle when flashing.\n\n   Right hole...scores 50,000....award  mystery when lit.....(mystery\n   consists of such things as adding shells....extra balls....becoming\n   \"Super\"...and 3 bonus chances)....advance S-U-P-E-R when\n   flashing....award quick pick when key is flashing.\n\n   Right lane rollover...(under  right plastic ramp)...scores\n   50,000....light right hole mystery when  lit.....advance 1,2,3,4 when\n   3 is flashing....score \"!\" value when in \"!\"  round....advance shells\n   when lit.\n\n   Video mode....the video mode  is started when the bullet sequence is\n   completed and the ball has entered  the castle.....it's like a Mario\n   Bros game...where you have to run and jump the gaps in the ground by\n   pushing the right flipper to jump...and  the left flipper to run\n   faster.\n\n   Secret stuff!\n   there's a few little secrets in  the game to get more points...\n\n   (1) in video mode...hold the left  flipper button in so that Mario\n   runs across the screen instead of walking....that  way..if you make it\n   to the end...you'll get 30 million points instead of  10...\n\n   (2) when the last castle has been  destroyed and the ball has\n   drained....make Mario jump when he runs across the screen towards the\n   castle...and you'll receive 30 million points instead  of 10\n   million....\n   there's a couple of other little  tricks hidden away in the machine as\n   well...but i can't think of them off hand...*s*\n\n   ______________________________________________________________________\n  e-mail:  rod71@hotmail.com\n   ______________________________________________________________________\n\n

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Super Mario Brothers Mushroom World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Super Mario Brothers Mushroom World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten By: Chuck Cochems\nDate: 23 Jan 1994\n\n\nPlayfield:  very weird...  NO outlanes or inlanes to speak of.\nGottlieb-style sinkholes that return the ball BELOW slingshots, one left\nramp, jet bumpers at the upper right (3), will feed to a sinkhole leading\nto right slingshot kickout.  Upper center is whistle target (standup).  To\nright is a sinkhole leading to left slingshot kickout.  To left is VUK to\nbumpers.  The ramp feeds to trough leading to left flipper, where it is\nheld for video modes.  Also, there are two banks of drop targets fit\nwithin the remaining space.\n\nRules:  Well, there are two different rule sets: easy and hard.  Also, it\ncan give out tickets instead of points in some modes, if a dispenser is\ninstalled.\n\nHard Rules\nOnly ONE free game earnable per paid credit.  Period.\nNo matter what.\n\nWhen plunging the ball, it gets sent into the jets every time.  This\nstarts line up game.  Each jet bumper hit brings the pictures closer to\nlining up after initial scrambling.  Each picture is worth something...\n\nMushroom=extra ball\n\nAnchor,Music Box=token bonus points.\n\nand the other important one:\n\nStarman, which you should be very happy to get...  The object of game is\nto complete the drop target banks.  Each completion is called a world.\nThese world names are Super Mario Brothers 3 references..  Starman\ninstantly completes a world by dropping the actual drop targets (yes,\nthey fall by themselves!!).  If you get starman, shoot for what you\nwant.  But if not, you enter the current world.\n\nThe game will drop a certain number of drop targets inversely\nproportional to the world number (always the same ones!), then kick out\nthe ball.  You have 30 seconds to hit the remaining drop targets to\ncomplete a world.  If you fail this task, the flippers die on you!  If\nyou succeed, the timer goes away, and you can play the field at your\nleisure, until you hit the VUK.  When not playing a world, this starts a\nnew line up game, and repeats the process just described.  When you ARE\nplaying a world, it does either a \"Tail Attack\" or \"Block buster\" round,\nwhich lasts as long as the ball is up there.  This also SHOULD stop the\ntimer.  If a jet bumper is hit in synch with certain display actions, you\net bonus points progressing up to 10M.  WARNING!  The Timer will NOT\nalways truly stop!  You may find that the timer is counting down at warp\nspeed when the ball kicks out!!!  This will usually happen only if you\nflail about on the flippers for no reason.\n\nClearing the targets has NO effect when NOT playing a world.\n\nBoom Boom:  this is the upper right sinkhole.  Hit three times to start\ntwo ball multiball.  This exists purely for it's own sake!  Should you do\nit?  NO!!!  If you do start it, then the timer will NOT stop when playing\na world, even if they BOTH are in the jets.  Also, timer tends to screw\nup then.\n\nWhistle:  The non-drop target.  It lights ramp for secret, which can be\nmany things.\n\nThe first time, and on alternating shots after that, it is a video mode.\nOne is the one from SMB.  you make Mario jump over holes and ghosts\n(instead of bullets!).  The other is a Frog Mario one where you swim up\nand down to dodge crabs and other stuff.  Each is worth 30M upon\ncompletion, less if you die.\n\nEven shots to a lit ramp score another secret.  This can be Luigi's\nSurprise (complete the world), Mario's Countdown (hurry-up collected on\nramp), or a point bonus.  Maybe an extra ball can also be awarded, but it\nusually won't happen.  Consider this stuff as stuff between video modes,\nwhere the real points are.\n\nBut wait, I said the object was to clear the banks..  Clearing the first\nseven worlds and starting the eighth one awards you a special!  It also\nstarts the eighth world , Dark Land.  Here is where you can also nab\npoints by the millions, OR tickets if it is set up to dispense them.  If\nit dispenses tickets, I don't think you can get ANY free games, but I\nhaven't seen one that gave tickets.  The drop targets will be lit, but\nwill drop two by two of their own accord, with the 25M ones dropping\nfirst.  You must hit one BEFORE it drops to get the points.  However, you\ndo keep the special no matter what if you reach that far.\n\nReplays CAN be earned on points, but keep in mind that the replay score\nis usually higher than the top scores, due to the number of specials that\nget awarded.\n\nWith this in mind, basic strategy follows...\n\nGo for that special FIRST.  This is your insurance policy, should you not\nget that top score.  As long as you do this, you can play again.\n\nAfter you do that, lock on to the video modes.  Become an expert at\ngrazing the RIGHT side of the whistle.  This puts it in the boom boom\nsinkhole, and returns it to a flipper.  After you get your one special,\nSTART NO MORE WORLDS!  Avoid the VUK like the plague!  If you DO hit it,\nclear the targets.  On a properly aligned game, the ball should, when\ncoming out of a kickout, bounce off the opposite flipper and land neatly\non the other flipper to trap if you raise it up after if bounces.  If\nyour game does this, you are set.  Here is the routine:  master it:\n\n\n  Hit whistle and regain control of the ball (into boom boom.  if you\nstart multiball, sacrifice one ball and save the other.)\n  If it is on right flipper, shoot ramp.\n  If it is on left flipper, pass the ball. (this can be done by tipping\nthe ball into the other sinkhole from a trap!)\n  If you used the boom boom method of grazing the whistle, dead bounce\nto left flipper.  Shoot ball straight into right kickout.  Dead bounce to\nright flipper (trap it!).  Shoot ramp. (you can use any means you wish to\npass the ball.  just DON'T start worlds..)\n  After shooting ramp, return to step one.  Repeat, getting 30M every\nother ramp shot from the video modes until you have the top score.\n(needless to say, master the video modes!  The ordinary Mario one is a\npattern game.  The Frog Mario one is RANDOM!  Remember, your swim range\nis limited.  ALWAYS return to the center after passing an obstacle in this\ngame so you don't get trapped.\n\n\nThis takes patience, but it keeps control of the ball.  After all is said\nand done, you have top score, and one credit on the game.\n\nEasy Rules\nThere is one playfield modification.  A thick post is\nremoved from the jet bumper area, enabling a ball to sneak in and out\nof the jets around the boom-boom hole.  The Line Up game is only awarded\non plunge.  Worlds start by themselves each time you clear one.  AND.....\nthe timer is DISABLED!  Also, you can now gain as many free games as you\nwant!  You can earn four specials in one game, now.  This allows a few\nchanges to the game plan.\n\nChange #1:  Multiball is now a viable option, as there is no timer to\nscrew you over, and it helps you clear the drop targets faster.  Enter it\nas much as possible until you get your special.\n\nChange #2:  You can now graze the LEFT side of the whistle as well, and\nif the ball doesn't drift out through the new bumper hole, you don't have\nto pass it to the right flipper.  Again, the lack of a timer allows this\nplan.  However, the old game plan still keeps more ball control, and\nstill works..\n\nNow if the game is set up as a redemption machine, then the only strategy\nis go for the eighth world, and get your tickets.  Hit the ramp when it is\nlit, but otherwise go for the targets.\n\nUnlike most pinball games, SMW is totally masterable.  That is, you can\nessentially keep the ball under your control at ALL times.  There is no\nrandomness that isn't either in the video modes, or totally AVOIDABLE\nunder hard, or wizard, rules, as I call them!  But what about the drop\ntargets, you ask?  Well, there is no randomness there!!!  The ball will\nrebound off the drop targets in a predictable fashion!  You must learn how\nthe ball bounces off the drop targets.  Learn the bank shots, which hit\ntargets from BOTH banks.  Learn what the few drain shots are, then avoid\nthem.  Although it would seem this isn't so, you can keep the ball under\nyour control 100% of the time on hard rules.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Surf 'n' Safari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Surf 'n' Safari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MJK Guide\nto Surf 'N Safari\nLast updated: 29/6/93 (6/29/93 if you're American :).\n\n\nOk, you all know the routine: This rules sheet is as public domain as it can\nbe, considering that Premier Technology or Gottlieb or someone owns most of the\nsubject matter. Except \"Multiball\", of course.\n\"Surf 'N Safari\" is probably a trade-mark of Premier Technology.\n\nThe abbreviations \"K\" for one thousand points and \"M\" for one million points are\nused relentlessly and mercilessly throughout this rules sheet.\n\nObject of the Game\nRide all the slides to complete the bonus grid for various special rounds.\nAnd then do it again. Yes.\n\nYour Host\nYour host is Rodney the crocodile, who sits in the middle of the playfield\n(although he doesn't move). Any text contained in \"\" marks is spoken by Rodney.\nRodney is accompanied by various other animals, including a Toucan.\nRodney occasionally laughs at you during play (where've we seen that before?),\nand the Toucan says \"Surf 'N Safari, ahrark-ahrark\" (well, how would you spell\nit?) for no absolutely no reason whatsoever.\n\nOh, and if you think that I've rather arbitrarily decided that Rodney is a\ncrocodile, my evidence is the quote \"Later, Gater!\" at the end of the game. The\ncorrect response is obviously \"In a while, crocodile\" (or maybe: \"While\nDile!\" :) so therefore Rodney is a croc.  Thus proved.\n\nThe Playfield\nThis is a list of the major playfield items.\n\nFrom left to right:\n\n\nSouvenirs targetOn the bottom left, just above the outlane. Spring loaded, so\nthe ball is bounced back with force from it. It has a line of three purple\nlights pointing to it, marked '1', '2', 'Extra Ball'.\nPipelineSaucer, feeds to left inlane through a metal 'pipe'. It is labelled\n'The Pipeline' and has two lights marked 'Adv. Double' and 'Lock'.\nRapidsRamp around back of playfield, feeds to right inlane. There is a bridge\nacross the entrance labelled 'The Rapids', 'Go For Record', 'Special',\n'Million Whirlpool' and 'Jackpot'. The entrance is labelled 'The Rapids', has\na picture of the Toucan, and a circle containing three arrows forming a\nsmaller circle (this is the Go For The Record light).\nThree Million targetSmall target on the right side of the rapids entrance,\nlabelled '3 Million'.\nBoomerangSpinner lane. Sort of a left orbit shot, with the ball coming out to\nthe right of the splash targets. It has lights marked 50K, 50K, 250K and one\nwith an elephant in the lane leading to the spinner. It is labelled 'The\nBoomerang'.\nSplash targetsThree drop targets in the centre of the playfield. They are\nlabelled 'Slippery When Wet' and 'The Splash' and has a light marked 500K.\nRodney the crocodile sits atop these targets.\nWhirlpoolOne of those whirlpool/cup/Ken things with two optical sensors. Just\nbehind the Splash targets. Feeds to the pop bumpers via a hole in at the\nbottom.\nPop bumpersThree of 'em. Behind the Splash and beneath the Whirlpool.\nPlungeMystery award saucer beneath Whirlpool. Feeds (via Rapids ramp) to\nright inlane.\nBoomerang return laneImpossible to shoot directly from the flippers (although\nthe ball sometimes rebounds up it).\nWhirlpool rampFeeds to the Whirlpool. It has a bridge across the entrance\nlabelled 'The Whirlpool' and lights marked 50K, 100K, 200K and 'Million'.\nThe entrance is labelled with a picture of a Monkey, and 'Adv. Arcade'.\nSnack Attack targetsThree drop targets on right side of playfield, facing\nleft. 'Yummy good junk food' is written on the target bank (oh dear), and the\nlights in front of the targets are marked 5K, 50K, and 500K.\nArcade targetOn the bottom right, just above the outlane. Spring loaded like\nthe Souvenirs target. It has three lights marked 100K, 200K, and 300K. There\nis also a rather neat picture of a S'NS pin.\nExit awardsThese are the outlane drain roll-overs.\nAdvance Random Slide targetsThese are the inlane roll-overs.\nFlippersTwo, usual places.\nSlingshotsTwo, usual places.\nBonus GridA five by five grid of lights just above the flippers, marked with\nthe various bonus rounds and awards. Beneath the grid are two lights marked\nSpecial and Extra Special. Beneath these lights is a white light marked\n'Double Everything'.\n\n\nSkill Shot\n\"Shoot gently, man\". Plunge into the Plunge on your first attempt for a random\naward (see Plunge Awards).\n\nToo gently and the ball comes back to the plunger \"You shoot too softly\".\n\nToo hard and the ball goes into the pop bumpers \"You shot too hard\".\n\nIf you make the skill shot after plunging too gently at first then you will\nreceive \"Absoooluuuuutely nothing\".\n\nBall Saver\nIf you plunge too hard and the ball goes into the pop bumpers then the exit\naward lights will flash for a short time (about ten seconds). The exit award\nwill always be an extra ball when flashing.\n\n(Note: you get your end of ball bonus when this happens).\n\nBonus Grid\nHitting one of the Pipeline, Rapids, Boomerang, Splash (all three targets), or\nWhirlpool will advance one of the columns on the bonus grid.\n\nThe columns cannot be advanced during Multiball or any of the bonus rounds\n(except for Double Round).\n\nWhen only one light is left on a column Rodney will tell you \"One more for the\n\". He will also say this at the start of a ball.\n\nCompleting a row or column awards a bonus (see Grid Awards).\n\nAdvance Random Slide Targets\nThe Advance Random Slide roll-overs on the inlanes advance a column when lit.\nEach time you advance a column, Rodney tells you which one it was, e.g. \"You\nadvanced the splash\". The light will also go out until another playfield\ntarget has been hit (so you don't get two advances when the ball rolls up and\ndown the inlane).\n\nOn the first grid both roll-overs are lit except for when the ball is being\nreturned from the Pipeline, Rapids or Plunge.\n\nOn subsequent grids only one is lit. It is changed by the slingshots or by\nhitting the lit roll-over.\n\nWhen only the top row is incomplete (the top two rows during Double Round) the\nlights go out.\n\nGrid Awards\nRows\n\n\nBottom rowlight Exit award on outlanes. This gives a random point award for an\noutlane drain. This row is sometimes lit at the start of a game (and hence so\nare the Exit lights). This always gives a score between 5K and 5M except for\nwhen flashing at the start of a ball, when it awards an extra ball.\n\nThe Exit lights stay lit as long as the bottom row of the grid is lit, or until\nthe end of the ball.\n\nSecond rowlight Arcade target. \"The Arcade target is lit\".\n\nThe Arcade target is now worth 100K {+100K} to a limit of 600K. The value is\nadvanced by the Whirlpool when 'Adv. Arcade' is lit (after the Whirlpool has\nbeen completed). The Arcade target stays lit as long as the second row of the\ngrid is lit.\n\nThird rowlight Lock. \"Shoot the Pipeline for Multiball\". The Pipeline is lit\nfor Multiball (see Multiball). It remains lit until collected or until the end\nof the ball.\n\nFourth rowlight Souvenirs target. \"Advance the Souvenirs target for extra\nball\". The Souvenirs target is lit for extra ball. It must be hit three times to\nadvance the purple light to Extra Ball. Each light only stays lit for a short\ntime before needing to be relit.\n\nTop rowlight Super Score. The Arcade target is lit for 1M, increasing for\neach hit thereafter by 1M to some limit. It stays lit until the end of the\nball.\n\n\nColumns\nThese start bonus rounds. The lengths of these rounds may vary from machine to\nmachine. The time left is shown on the bonus grid. During a timed round no\nother feature can be advanced. When the timer gets to five, Rodney (and the\nToucan) count down out loud. When the round is over, Rodney says \"Your time is\nup\".\n\n\nPipelineThree Million target round. \"Hit the Three Million target\". Lights\nthe three million target (for 3M a hit, would you believe, and the quote \"Three\nMillion!\") for nine seconds.\n\nRapidslights Multiball at the Pipeline. \"Shoot the Pipeline for Multiball\".\nThis is a Hurry Up award, starting at 5M. The Multiball is lost if the Hurry Up\nscore times out \"Your time is up\". See Multiball.\n\nSplashstarts Safari. \"Shoot all the animals for special\". Lights the Rapids\n(Toucan), Boomerang (Elephant), Whirlpool (Monkey - wearing shades!) and Arcade\ntarget (Lion). These can be hit in any order for 1M, 2M, 3M then special.\nThe Safari lasts for nineteen seconds.\n\nBoomerang\"Shoot the spinner\". Lights the Boomerang for 250K or so a spin\nfor nine seconds.\n\nWhirlpoolextra ball round. \"Shoot all flashing lights for extra ball\". Two\n(random) slides are lit. Hitting both within twelve seconds awards extra ball.\n\n\nCompleted grid\nEach completed grid adds 5M to your end of ball bonus. At the start of any\nfurther grids the 'Special' light will be lit. After odd numbered grids have\nbeen completed the 'Extra Special' light will also be lit.\nExtra Special goes out if the grid is not completed before the ball is lost.\nCompleting a further grid awards Special, and if Extra Special is lit awards\na second Special.\n\nMultiball\nMultiball can be started by lighting and making the lock at the Pipeline (by\ncompleting the bottom three rows of the grid or the Rapids column) or by being\nawarded Instant Multiball by the Plunge.\n\nIf multiball is started by locking a ball at the pipeline then making the skill\nshot awards three ball multiball. Otherwise, multiball is two ball.\n\nAt the start of multiball, two random targets are lit \"Shoot all the flashing\nlights to light Jackpot\". The lights are two of: the Pipeline, the Rapids, the\nBoomerang, the Whirlpool and the Arcade, but not the Souvenirs target or the\nSplash. Shooting the lit shots lights the Rapids for Jackpot for 5M.\n\n\"Shoot the Rapids for Jackpot\" \"Jackpot!!\". Then, all five lights are lit.\n\n\"Hit all the flashing lights to light Super Jackpot\".\n\nHitting all of them lights the Rapids for 30M \"Shoot the Rapids for Super\nJackpot\" \"Super Jackpot!!!!\".\n\nThe five lights are then lit for relighting the Super Jackpot, and so on.\n\nThe Jackpot value may sometimes be 9M. The Super Jackpot is always 30M.\n\nScoring Super Jackpots is the quickest way to score really highly, especially\nduring Double round.\n\nAfter multiball has ended, the Rapids are lit to light the Whirlpool Million\n\"Shoot the Rapids to light the Whirlpool Million\" for a short time (see\nWhirlpool Million).\n\nPlunge Awards\nThese are awarded by hitting the Plunge saucer which is lit at any time, except\nduring multiball or a timed round.\n\nThe awards are:\n\n\n  points (5K to 5M)\n  extra ball\n  light Souvenirs target\n  special\n  catch-up score (or 5M if you are in first place)\n  advance random slide\n  advance random slide to top\n  advance D-O-U-B-L-E\n  complete D-O-U-B-L-E (very nice :)\n  award everything (also very nice. Awards special, extra ball and completes\nthe grid. Actually, it can be a bit annoying if you've done most of the\ngrid because you don't get the bonus rounds. It does award all the Row\nawards though. It does not complete D-O-U-B-L-E)\n  instant multiball\n  swirl Whirlpool (gives five swirls, and advances the Whirlpool value, but\ndoesn't advance the Whirlpool column on the grid)\n  absooooluuutely nothing\n\n\nThere may be some others.\n\nOther Stuff\nAs well as advancing the Bonus Grid, the slides/targets have other effects.\n\n\nPipeline  when completed, shots to the pipeline light 'Adv. Double' for a\nshort time. If collected this adds a letter to D-O-U-B-L-E.\n\nAfter collecting 'Adv. Double' another target must be hit before the pipeline\nwill relight it.\n\nD-O-U-B-L-E letters cannot be collected during Multiball, or the timed\nrounds.\n\nD-O-U-B-L-E  advanced by the Plunge and the Pipeline.  Completing\nD-O-U-B-L-E awards Double round. Everything is doubled until the ball is\nlost (all scores, extra balls, specials, bonus grid advances). Well, almost\neverything - you only get one Advance Arcade out of the Whirlpool.\n\nRapids  when completed, consecutive shots to the Rapids are counted for\n\nGo For The Record. Beating the current record gets your initials in, and\nlights Special on the Rapids.\n\nDuring D-O-U-B-L-E round, Go For The Record counts up in twos.\n\nBoomerang  lit for 50K a spin all the time.\n\nSplash  lit for 500K for all three targets all the time.\n\nWhirlpool  at the start of each ball, the Whirlpool is worth 50K per swirl.\n\nThis is incremented by 50K for each Whirlpool shot, to a limit of 350K. This\nresets to 50K at the start of each ball. The swirling can only add up to a\nmaximum of 9,999,990 (although this can be D-O-U-B-L-E'd).\n\nWhen it has been completed, shots to the Whirlpool advance the Arcade target\nvalue (if it is lit).\n\nWhirlpool million  lit by the Rapids or by the Plunge. Each swirl is worth\n1M \"Million!\" if the Whirlpool is hit quickly. This has no limit - as long as\nyou keep swirling, you keep getting millions (but your arms will hate you for\nit).\n\nSnack Attack targets  What do these do? Nobody knows. Probably the first hit\nis worth 5K, the second 50K and the third 500K. The value awarded flashes for\na second.\n\n\nEnd of Ball Bonus\nCalculated by 10K for each lit light on the bonus grid, plus 5M for each\ncompleted grid.\n\n'You are Sh*t' Award - er, sorry, the Pity Extra Ball\nIf your score is less than 10M or so at the start of the final ball, then the\nSouvenirs target will be lit and already advanced to the 'Extra Ball' light\n(so only one hit is needed for extra ball).\n\nAlso, if you have not had multiball by your last ball then the Plunge will\naward 'instant multiball'.\n\nDeath Saves\nDeath saves are possible from the left side on S'NS, by bouncing the ball off\nthe pin by the entrance to the ball trough (see the Bang-Back/Death-Save guide\non the archive if you don't know what I mean).\n\nAfter a death save any timed round that is running will stop (except for Double\nround) :(.\n\nAttract Mode Prose\nDuring attract mode you are treated to the following rhyme (written):\nMy name is Rodney and I'm your host,\nRide my slides to score the most.\n\nApparently there is a similar ditty on Class of 1812.\n\nThe End\nNot a feature of the game (unlike a certain other Gottlieb game I could mention)\nbut a feature of this rules sheet.\n\nAnd here it is.\n\nThanks to:\n\n Kevin Martin\n James Nakamura\n\n\nMartin Keates.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Surf 'n' Safari", "possible_shots": "Souvenirs target, Pipeline, Rapids, Three Million target, Boomerang, Splash targets, Whirlpool, Pop bumpers, Plunge, Boomerang return lane, Whirlpool ramp, Snack Attack targets, Arcade target, Exit awards, Advance Random Slide targets, Flippers, Slingshots, Bonus Grid", "manufacturer": "Premier Technology", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/surfnsafari.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Surf 'n' Safari", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Swords of Fury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Swords of Fury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten by: B. Elmore. Copyright \u00a9.\n\n\nObLegal: Swords Of Fury is undoubtedly \u00a9 Williams, etc. etc.\nI believe it was released in 1987, but I'm not 100% certain of that.\n\nPlayfield features: 2-level machine, 4 flippers, 2 ramps.  Kickback on\nleft side.  Normal inlanes and lower flipper setup.  No jet bumpers\nanywhere on the machine!  Upper playfield is small and in upper-left:\none right-side-type mini flipper and 5 drop targets of an unusual kind\nacross the top; more about this later.  Full-sized left flipper just\nto the left of center high up on the machine.\n\nLike most games of this era, it has 7-digit scoring, and a jackpot\nthat ranges in value from 500K to 4M, held over from game to game\nslowly building till collected.  When collected, the jackpot drops to\n500K and builds from there; when a game (or multiple games at once)\nfinish and credits are 0, the jackpot increases to a minimum of 1.5M.\nAgain, like other games of this era, scoring rolls over at 9,999,990,\nand any score that exceeds this is automatically given #1 on the high\nscoreboard and displayed as 9,999,999 no matter what the final score\nis or what the final scores of the other games on the high scoreboard\nwere.  Replay does not auto-increment after a game where replay is\nobtained, unlike newer machines.  In fact, replay will only adjust by\n100K at a time, no matter how badly it needs to be adjusted, and\nreplay is always xx00K points.  During the game, once 10M is reached,\nonly the rightmost 7 digits of the score are displayed.  If replay+10M\nis reached, another replay is awarded, similarly for replay+20M, and I\npresume for all further ones.\n\nHigh on the right side of the top half machine is a plastic gate\nsystem that can direct a ball sent into it down one of 3 paths; it's\nreached by the center ramp or by the plunger.  The mechanism is\nsimilar to that across the top of High Speed.  The first path sends\nthe ball across the machine on a habitrail into the upper playfield.\nThe second sends the ball across the playfield on a parallel habitrail\ninto the ball lock; if another ball is already there, it's ejected\nbefore the first lands (if the sensor is functioning properly), and if\nno ball is there, it's locked as Ball 1 locked.  The third path drops\nthe ball back onto the upper part of the lower playfield, above the\nupper flipper, and awards a bonus multiplier increment, if it is less\nthan 7x.\n\nThe algorithm for which gate is open at any given time is somewhat\ncomplicated to explain, but becomes intuitive after some play.  The\nfirst few times the ball is sent down path 1.  After this the ball is\nsent down path 2, and path 1 is lit briefly.  Path 2 is again lit\nafter path 1 is successfully shot or timed out.  After a few times of\nthis it's sent down path 3 a few times, then back to path 1, etc.\n\nThe upper playfield can be reached via the first path from the center\nramp (or plunger), or from the right ramp.  It consists of a\nmini-flipper and 5 drop targets across the top, with lights above\neach.  Unlike most drop targets, there's nothing immediately behind\nthem; a ball that goes through where a dropped target is falls off the\nback of the upper playfield and exits onto the lower playfield through\nthe same exit that locked balls exit, onto the upper flipper on the\nmain playfield.  Early in the game, dropped targets pop back up almost\nimmediately, and as the game progresses they come back less quickly.\nAll five need only be collected once to collect the value for the set,\nwhether they are up or down.  Once the final one is collected, all\nfive will again pop back up, no matter how long or short they've been\ndown.  A score from 50K to 250K is awarded via a scheme as follows:\nthe initial value is 150K (?), and drops by 50K whenever the ball\nleaves the upper playfield, and raises by 50K whenever the U-Turn is\nshot.  (is this right?)  A bonus multiplier is awarded, and if the\nmultiplier is to 7x, special is lit for the next one (on harder\nsettings, 2 more may have to be collected before special is lit).\n\nThe upper playfield is also used to collect jackpot in multiball.  Its\nnormal function is suspended until jackpot is collected or multiball\nends.\n\nThe center ramp is used to advance and collect Lionman.  It starts out\nat 100K, is advanced 25K by shooting it the first time, 50K the\nsecond, 75K the third, 100K the fourth, to a maximum of 1M.  Thus it\ncan have the values 100K, 125K, 175K, 250K, 350K, 475K, 625K, 800K,\nand 1M.  Lionman is lit by spelling AVENGER.  I forget whether\ncollecting Lionman resets its value to 100K, I believe it does.\n\nThe Lionman value is not multiplied by the playfield multiplier during\nmultiball.\n\nSeven round contact targets are scattered around the main playfield\nspelling AVENGER: two on the upper left above the upper flipper, three\nto the right of the upper flipper and above and to the left of the\nright ramp, and two below and to the right of the right ramp (and\nabove the right outlane area).  Hitting the appropriate one spots the\ncorresponding letter.  Making the return lanes (labeled with *) spots\nthe next letter in AVENGER and lights the right ramp to spell out\nAVENGER.  (Thus if the * gives you the last letter in AVENGER, making\nthe right ramp immediately afterwards can collect 2 AVENGERs quickly).\nMaking AVENGER scores 50K, 150K, 250K and then Extra Ball, resetting\nto 50K afterwards.  Multiple extra balls can be collected this way\nsimply by making sufficiently many AVENGERs.  AVENGER also lights the\ncenter ramp for Lionman.\n\nThe AVENGER value resets to 50K after each ball, unless it's on Extra\nBall, in which case it stays there until collected.  If ball 1 and 2\nare very low-scoring (score after ball 2 of around 400K or less), the\nAVENGER value is advanced to Extra Ball at the start of ball 3, as a\n\"pity\" award.\n\nThe left tunnel (Titan?) is shot to lock balls.  It is always lit to\nlock balls except during multiball itself.  Multiball starts after the\n3rd ball is locked.  At the start of multiball the drop targets are\nraised on the upper playfield, and all 3 balls are kicked out.  A\nroving light moves back and forth on the drop targets that are still\nup on the upper playfield; hitting this target awards jackpot.  While\n3 balls remain on the playfield, all playfield scores excluding the\njackpot and Lionman are multiplied by 3; after 1 ball drains and 2\nballs remain all scores are multiplied by 2 with the same exceptions.\nJackpot on the upper playfield goes away as soon as multiball ends.\n\nThere is a spinner at the entrance to the Titan tunnel, with lights\nunder it reading 1000, 1500 and 2000.  I don't know what controls its\nvalue, but I suspect it's tied to the bonus multiplier somehow.\n\nThe lower exit from the upper playfield underneath the mini-flipper\ndrops the ball halfway up the Titan tunnel, where it falls toward the\nlower flippers.\n\nStarting multiball also relights the kickback.  This is the only way\nkickback can be relit, except for draining the ball.\n\nAfter a player's score reaches 2M (this score seems to be fixed\nregardless of the replay value), the game does several things to\nincrease game difficulty.  Lionman on the center ramp times out very\nquickly (within about 3 seconds), as does scoring AVENGER on the right\nramp.  There are some other things that happen as well, I believe, but\nI can't remember what they are.\n\nLow on the left center of the machine is the U-turn.  It has two\nspinners, one in front of each entrance.  Unlike the U-turn in Black\nKnight 2000, it isn't buried back under anything.  Each spinner adds\n200 to your bonus, and can be lit for 3x for a little while (600 to\nbonus) by the star on the return lanes.  They also advance the clear\ndrop target value on the upper playfield.\n\nBehind the upper ramp, there's another u-turn with entrances on either\nside of the upper ramp named Ogres Alley.  One side is lit to advance\nits value, and the other side to collect.  The values are\nxx-xx-xx-xx-100K-500K; it can be collected at 500K only once per game.\nSince Ogres Alley values are multiplied by the playfield multiplier,\nit's often a good strategy to save collecting it at 500K until the\nstart of multiball, so it can be collected for 1.5M instead.  When\nit's at its maximum value, one side is lit to collect and the other is\nunlit.  The sides are exchanged by the slingshot kickers.  Both\noutlanes are also part of Ogres Alley, and mimic their upper-playfield\ncounterparts.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Swords of Fury", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/swordsoffury.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Swords of Fury", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I don't even have access to this machine\nlocally.  Any additional information, comments, or corrections are welcome, and\nshould be sent to me.\n\nThis rule compilation and tips sheet is, to the extent possible (in light\nof the subject matter being the property of Data East), public domain.\n\nAbbreviations and acronyms used in this rules sheet:\n\n\n    CF \t\tCreature Feature\n    DE \t\tData East\n    EB \t\tExtra Ball\n    IJ \t\tIndiana Jones\n    JP \t\tJurassic Park\n    K  \t\tThousand points\n    LAH \tLast Action Hero\n    M  \t\tMillion points\n    TAF \tThe Addams Family\n    TFTC\tTales from the Crypt\n    TZ \t\tTwilight Zone\n    VUK \tVertical upright kicker\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nTales from the Crypt (Commonly abbreviated TFTC in USENET posts) is a Data East\nmachine, released late in 1993. IMHO it is one of the best DE games. It is\nbased on the HBO T.V.  series of the same name, which I haven't seen, so I\ncan't give you any details on how well the theme has been used.\n\nThe pin is of standard (24\") width. Its playfield has two ramps, with the right\none being a 'vertical loopback'.  It has the standard triangular slingshots\nabove each flipper, one inlane and one outlane on each side, and a dot-matrix\ndisplay.  It has 3 flippers:  The two standard ones, and an upper right flipper\npositioned similarly to the one on Whirlwind.\n\nThere are no easy shots in this game, so I suspect that advanced players may\nlike this game more than novices (is that a change for DE machines?) The rule\nset is very well developed, and scoring is rather well balanced.  It is a\nmode-based game, and modes can run concurrently as in JP, TAF, and TZ.  Unlike\nJP, modes DO continue to run even if you start multiball; but they do run\nduring the opening multiball animations, and therefore you lose some time on\nthem.\n\nI don't know what ROM-level I played, but in comparing my notes with those of\nKevin, I would suspect that it was around 2.x, and Kevin's machines was 3.01.\nThere does seem to have been several changes in scoring between the versions.\nIn this rules sheet, I refer to 2.x and earlier as 'older ROMs', and 3.x and\nlater as 'newer ROMs'.\n\nPLAYFIELD LAYOUT\nThe game has standard inlane/outlane format, with a kickback on the left side.\nThe kickback is lit at the beginning of each ball.\n\nGoing from left to right, beginning at the flippers:\n\n\n Left inlane  Lights drop targets for a random door prize of 1M to 3M.\n\n Left outlane  has a kickback, called the 'crypt kicker'. When lit, the\nball is kicked back into play; the kickback flashes for about 2 seconds, so if\nthe ball returns there during that time it is also kicked back. The ball\nshould kick to the upper right spinner for a shot from the upper flipper, but\non the machine I played it rarely did that. The first time each ball the\nkicker is relit by hitting an unlit KEEPER target; subsequent times that ball\nyou must completely spell KEEPER. Note that if you do whatever you have to do\nto relight the kickback while it's still flashing its grace period, it doesn't\nrelight. The \"Super Crypt Kicker\" creature feature (abbreviated CF, which\nare the modes of the game, like the doors in TZ or mansion in TAF, and are\ndescribed in more detail later) causes the kickback to remain lit for the rest\nof the ball.\n\n K-E-E targets  to form the first half of the word KEEPER. The P-E-R targets\nare on the opposite side of the playfield. These are eyeball targets as on\nLAH. They usually require a direct hit to register.  Hitting a target lights\nit. Getting all of them advances the bonus multiplier (from 2x to 4x to 6x to\na max of 8x), or 1M each time after bonus multiplier has reached 8x, and\nrelights the kickback. Note that the first time each ball that the kickback\nneeds to be relit, you only need to hit one unlit target to relight it. These\ntargets are also used in the \"Super Keeper Targets\" CF.\n\n Captive ball  the captive ball only needs to travel a short distance to hit\nits target (like the lower left on LAH), but on the machine I played it only\nseemed to register with a very hard hit. This ball is used to add a ball during\nmultiball and in the \"Skull Cracking\" CF. When neither of those are in effect,\nmultiple hits of the ball results in points or EB:  5 hits for 5M, 10 hits for\nEB or 10M, 20 hits for 20M, 30 hits for 30M, etc.  [I personally think that you\nneed way too many hits to score; why would you want to shoot the captive ball\n30 times?]\n\n Left spinner  this is a left semi-orbit shot with a spinner at the entrance.\nA successful shot through the orbit directs the ball to the pop bumpers at the\ntop of the playfield. The spinner can be lit to relight the center scoop to\nstart a new CF, and changes the current selected CF if it is not locked in\n(more later).  The spinner advances the value of the single-jackpot during\nmultiball. The spinner is also used in the \"Frightmare\" and \"Werewolf\" CFs,\nand can be a significant point-getter when you shoot them during one of the\nfrenzy modes.\n\n Left ramp  A steep ramp which feeds the ball via habitrails to the right\ninlane. It has four lights: Rats, Goblins, Ghosts, and Bats, but I'm not sure\nwhy. From the display, they should be \"bat 1\", \"bat 2\", \"bat 3\", and \"bat 4\".\nTo start, Rats is flashing; shooting the ramp awards a bat, and makes it lit.\nShooting the ramp again lights the next one (Goblins), and the subsequent ramp\nawards the second bat.  Repeat this until you've collected 4 bats (i.e. every\nalternate ramp shot awards a bat), which advances or lights the right ramp\n(more later). I don't know the exact scoring, but a ramp shot which awards a\nbat is worth about 2M or 3M on older ROMs, and 5M on newer ROMs, while the\nother ramp shots scores only a few thousand points. The ramp scores the jackpot\nduring multiball. It is also used in the \"Thunder Storm\" CF.\n\n Electric Chair  (or Center scoop; well, actually it's the only scoop). The\norientation of the scoop is towards the area above the right slingshot, and\nnot the lower right flipper, making it a difficult shot from the lower right\nflipper.  It is an easier shot from the upper right flipper, as the scoop is\nopened at both the front and right side. When lit, this scoop starts the\n\"Creature Feature\", which are the games modes. More about the CFs is given\nlater. The scoop is also used in the \"Electric Chair\" CF.\n\n Tombstone and Crypt.  A tombstone (which is a huge target the size of the\ngreed target in TAF) blocks the Crypt. Each hit of the target spots the next\nletter in C-R-Y-P-T. When all letters have been spotted, the tombstone lowers\ninto the playfield making it possible to shoot the Crypt, which starts\nmultiball. I don't know if this was unique to the machine I played or not, but\nalthough the tombstone is large, hits to it often did not register, even with\nwhat seemed to be a good hit. The tombstone is partially blocked by the\nElectric Chair when shooting it from the lower right flipper, making it a tough\nshot.  It is an easier shot from the upper right flipper.  The Crypt must be\nshot from the upper right flipper, or requires a deflection off a post in order\nto shoot it directly from one of the lower flippers. The Crypt is an eject hold\nwith a VUK.  It sends the ball into another eject hole with VUK behind the\ncenter spinner, which in turn feeds the upper right flipper. The Tombstone and\nCrypt are also used during multiball and during the \"Robbing the Crypt\" CF.\n\n Pop Bumpers  this is a standard triangle configuration of 3 pop bumpers.\nThey are behind the drop targets, but you can shoot into them with a shot\nbetween the tombstone and drop targets. Balls in the pop bumpers often come out\nthis way. The pop bumpers can also be shot via the left spinner or a soft shot\nfrom the right spinner. Each pop is typically worth 100K a shot. Super pops can\nbe lit from the right inlane; it's a fairly long timer, and hitting a pop\nbumper resets half of it.  I haven't figured out the exact timings yet, but\nthey're quite liberal.  The pop bumpers are also used in the \"Psycho Pops\" CF.\n\n Guillotine Targets  these 3 drop targets form a bank in front of the pop\nbumpers.  Completing the three targets advances the end-of-ball bonus\nmultiplier (by 2x each time, up to 8x), or 1M a shot after the multiplier has\nreached 8x. A ball which passes through the left inlane lights the targets for\na short time period (about 5 seconds) to give a random award between 1M and 3M\nif they are hit within that time period.  When they are lit, the lights '1',\n'2', and '3' on the playfield are flashing. The targets are also used in the\n\"Super Guillotine Targets\" CF.\n\n Center spinner  a shot through this spinner sends the ball into a VUK which\nfeeds the upper right flipper by dropping the ball about an inch above the\nflipper. You collect the extra ball at this VUK, and you can start the first\nmultiball here too. The spinner is also used in the \"Frightmare\" CF.\n\n Right ramp  This ramp does a vertical U-turn to send the ball back to the\nleft inlane. A shot that only makes it up partially lands onto the habitrail\ncoming from the right ramp, and awards you a 5M 'trick shot' as well as a\nsuccessful right ramp shot. The ramp is used to start frenzy modes. The modes\nare 'Living Dead', 'Chainsaw Mode', 'Grave Digger', and 'Play the Organ' (which\nare lit in that order). If a frenzy mode is flashing, then the frenzy begins.\nThe frenzy lasts 15 seconds, and every target hit gives you points.  For the\nLiving Dead, it is 250K per hit; for Chainsaw Mode it is 500K per hit; Grave\nDigger is 750K per hit; and \"Play the Organ\" is 1M per hit.  The bonus from\nyour frenzy is awarded with your end-of-ball bonus, and is called the \"Fast\nGoring\" (pun on Fast Scoring) bonus. If a frenzy mode is not flashing, then a\nright ramp shot lights the next one. Also, if you get 4 bats on the right ramp,\nthen it lights the next frenzy.  If a frenzy is already lit, then it makes that\nlight solid (as though it was awarded, but doesn't actually award it) and makes\nthe next one flashing (which is a good thing, since the next one is a higher\nvalued frenzy). Note that frenzys (or is that frenzies :-)) can be started\nanytime, even during multiball. The Double Jackpot is scored on the right ramp\nduring multiball. The ramp is also used during the \"Thunder Storm\" CF.\n\n Right spinner  this is a right orbit shot with a spinner at the entrance,\nwhich generally feeds all the way around back through the left orbit, so that\nrepeated orbit shots can be made. The first orbit is worth 500K, the next\nconsecutive orbit is 1M, followed by 1.5M, 2M, and a max of 2.5M.  (On older\nROMs it's 500K, 1M, 2M, 4M ...)  If you hit any other targets other than the\nspinners on the orbit, then you go back to the 500K value.  There is a diverter\nin this lane which sends the ball into the VUK of the center spinner, which in\nturn returns the ball to the upper right flipper (note, however, that if\nthe extra ball is lit here, it is *not* awarded, you must send the ball to\nthis hold via the center spinner to collect an EB).  The diverter is active\nduring Multiball Ready, Multiball Restart, Electric Chair CF, Robbing The Crypt\nCF, and Crypt Jam.  As with the left spinner, it can be used to relight the\nelectric chair when lit, or to alternate the selected CF. The spinner advances\nthe value of the Double Jackpot during multiball when that jackpot is lit. It\nis also used in the \"Frightmare\" CF.\n\n P-E-R targets  of KEEPER. Like the K-E-E targets; see above for description.\n\n Right Outlane  scores 3M points.\n\n Right Inlane  lights Chop Pops (i.e. super pops).\n\n Plunger   this game has an auto-plunger. The button is in the form of a fancy\ndoor handle with the Cryptkeeper's head. Press the door handle as if you wanted\nto open the door, and that launches the ball. There is a skill shot; see\nbelow.\n\n\nCREATURE FEATURES\nThe Creature Features (abbreviated CF) are the modes of this game. Instead of a\nmansion (as in TAF) or door (as in TZ) on the playfield, you get a well!  It's\nmade up to look like a well, but because it just happens to have twelve values\nit looks like a clock.  So because it looks like a clock, I'll call it that\n:-).  Each hour of the clock is a different CF.\n\nA CF is started by shooting the electric chair (center scoop) when lit. After\nstarting a CF, the scoop can be relit by a shot to the lit spinner (either\nleft or right, and alternates with each slingshot hit). Note that in general\nshooting the right spinner brings the ball back down the left orbit, and hence\nscores both spinners and relights the CF.\n\nMost CF's can run concurrently. The only exceptions are the \"Electric Chair\"\nand \"Skull Cracking\" CFs, which are multiball CFs.  The CF relite sometimes\nmesses up during the Skull Cracking CF on some ROMs.\n\nThe CF that is awarded is the one that is flashing. Shooting any of the\nspinners changes which one is flashing, unless that CF is 'locked in'.  You\ncan lock-in a CF by pressing the door handle (which you use to launch the\nball).  You can also unlock the feature by pressing the door handle again.\n\nThe CFs, in order on the clock, are as follows (the number in brackets is the\nclock position on the playfield).\n\nI think that most of the modes have been very well thought out; much better\nthan IJ where many of the modes make use of the same shots (ramps & orbits).\nEach mode concentrates on a different target or set of targets.\n\n\n [1] Thunder Storm  Hit the ramps; doesn't matter if it's left or right ramp.\nFirst ramp is 1M, and each subsequent ramp is 3M more (i.e. 1M, 4M, 7M, 10M,\n13M and a max of 15M.). The mode lasts for 20 seconds.\n\n [2] Lite Skull Cracking  You have 20 seconds to hit the captive ball for 5M and\nadd-a-ball.  You can add up to five balls this way.  Once you have 2 balls in\nplay, then each captive ball hit is 5M per hit with 2 balls in play, 10M for 3\nballs in play, 15M for 4, and 20M for 5 _or_ 6 balls in play.\n\n [3] Door Prize Select  This is the only video mode in the game.  You are given\nthree doors: left, center, and right. Use the flippers to select which door,\nthen press the door handle (which you also use to launch a ball) to open it.\nBehind it is either 5M, 10M on older ROMs, or 5M, 10M, 15M or 20M on newer\nROMs, or the picture of a person being hung.  If you get the points, you get\nanother set of 3 doors.  Supposedly there could also be an extra ball or\nspecial behind a door, but I haven't seen that yet.  If you get the door with\nthe person being hung, then the video mode is over. Older ROMs had a pattern,\nbut newer ROMs (3.01 and later) have a random sequence.  The farthest I've\ngotten (on older ROMs) is to level 6.  In the newer ROMs, Special seems to be\nawarded if you make it through three levels; but the random sequence makes it\nharder and harder to get.\n\n [4] Frightmare  Shoot 25 spinners in 25 seconds to score 25M. Note that a\nhard shot through a spinner can score as many as 10 spins, so you can usually\nscore the points with 3 spinner shots. (Hint: shoot the right spinner, as the\nball loops around and comes through the left spinner giving you even more\nspins for your shot!)\n\n [5] Psycho Pops  Get 25 pop bumper hits in 25 seconds for 25M. As with the\nsimilar mode in JP where you try to save Tommy, in the older ROMs, this mode is\nhardly worth shooting for. I shot the pop bumpers 6 times in one game during\nthis mode, and still only managed 19 pop-bumper hits.  In the newer ROMs,\nhitting any pop bumper resets the counter to a minimum of 9 seconds.\n\n [6] Robbing the Crypt   The tombstone is lowered; shoot the crypt to score\npoints.  Each shot scores 10M and spots the next letter in CRYPT.  Completing\nthe last letter T scores 25M instead of 10M, and ends the round.  The timer\nresets to 4 seconds on each successful hit, giving you long enough (hopefully)\nto loop the shot continuously.\n\n [7] Lite Extra Ball  Quite Obvious. Collect the EB by shooting the center\nspinner.  You can only light one EB at a time; if you light it more than once,\nonly one is awarded (i.e. they do not stack like in IJ or TZ).  Any EB\ncollected after the max/game (default is 3, Kevin thinks :-)) is worth 50M.\n\n [8] Super Guillotine Targets  You have 25 seconds to shoot the drop targets as\noften as you can. Initially each drop target is worth 3M. If you hit the\ntarget, you are awarded that value, and the value for that target only\nincreases to 4M. The value of each target is shown on the dot-matrix display.\nIf you hit 2 targets at once, then you are awarded the value for both targets,\nand the value of both those targets is increased by 1M. The targets reset\nimmediately each time you hit any one of them.  The maximum value of any one\ntarget is 7M.  I've been able to average 20M to 30M in this mode.\n\n [9] Lite Werewolf Countdown  This is a hurry-up shot to the left spinner.\nThe value begins at 30M and counts down (quickly enough). Shooting the left\nspinner once awards the value.\n\n [10] Lite Super Crypt Kicker  Lights the left kickback for the remainder of\nthe ball. Even if a ball drains down the left and the kickback is activated,\nthe kickback remains lit, and therefore you don't have relight it. This is a\ngreat thing to have lit during multiball!\n\n [11] Electric Chair  This is a 6-ball multiball mode, where you aim for the\nelectric chair (i.e. center scoop). Each ball to the scoop scores\n1M*balls_in_play. The mode ends when you have only 1 ball left. Since the\ncenter scoop is tough to hit from the lower flippers, I haven't been able to\nscore very high on this mode. I think it should have been 2M*balls_in_play like\non IJ.\n\n [12] Super Keeper Targets  This mode is similar to the super guillotine\ntargets, except that you shoot the eyeball KEEPER targets instead.  Each\ntarget starts at 2M, and increases by 1M for each hit. Since it is really\ndifficult to hit more than one target at once, I haven't found this mode to be\nvery worthwhile, rarely getting scores about 10M or 15M.  Each target\nmaxes out at 5M.  If you make all six then you get a 99M bonus.\n\n [all] Crypt Jam  After you have started all 12 CFs, the electric chair is lit\nfor the Crypt Jam. See the spoilers below if you want to know what you get\n(but considering the current trend of mode-based games, it is probably\nnot hard to guess).\n\n\nCRYPT MULTIBALL\nCRYPT multiball is started by shooting the Crypt, which can only be done after\nthe tombstone in front of it has been lowered. Each hit of the tombstone\nspots the next letter in CRYPT. The 'C' is spotted at the beginning of the\ngame, and two letters are spotted before the start of each ball until the\nfirst multiball has been obtained.\n\nAfter getting CRYPT the first time, both the Crypt and center spinner are lit;\nshoot either one to start multiball. For subsequent multiballs, only the\nCrypt is lit to start it.\n\nWhen you start multiball, two balls are automatically launched, and the third\none is ejected to the upper right flipper for a shot to the Crypt.  The Crypt\nscores 1M*balls-in-play and adds that value to the base Jackpot value as well.\n\nDuring multiball, hit the left ramp to score the Jackpot, which has an initial\nbase value of 25M (20M in older ROMs), and increases with shots to the left\nspinner (130K per spin) and Crypt (1M*balls-in-play).\n\nOnce that Jackpot is collected, shoot the right ramp for a Double Jackpot,\nwhich has a base value of double the value of the right-ramp Jackpot you\ncollected (thus minimum of 50M, or 40M in older ROMs) and increases with the\nright spinner (260K per spin) and Crypt (2M*balls-in-play).\n\nNote that getting the Double Jackpot may also start a frenzy mode if the next\nfrenzy mode is flashing; this is a great time to get frenzy.\n\nAfter collecting the Double Jackpot, the tombstone raises.  You must hit the\nTombstone 5 times to spell C-R-Y-P-T, at which time the Monster Jackpot is\nlit.  Each letter adds a ball but isn't worth any points.  The Monster Jackpot\nis 50M plus the Double Jackpot value when it was collected, for a minimum of\n100M.  Subsequent Monster Jackpots are each 50M more (you must spell CRYPT\nagain each time), increasing without limit.\n\nWhen you hit the Tombstone to spell CRYPT and it's adding a ball (the first\ntime through and you don't already have all six balls), you have to wait\nuntil that ball is in play before hitting it again will count.  Also,\nhitting the Tombstone will in that case reset the drop targets.\n\nAfter collecting the Monster Jackpot, the Tombstone comes back up and you spell\nCRYPT again, but it no longer adds balls into play.\n\nUntil the point where you collect the Double Jackpot, Hitting the captive ball\nduring multiball adds another ball to your play.\n\nMultiball Restart:  If you fail to collect the jackpot, the center spinner and\nCrypt are lit for 12 seconds to restart Multiball.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\nAs with most DE games, Death saves are possible. The game awards you 3M for\neach Death Save.\n\nThere is no smart missile equivalent in this game.\n\nSkill shot: The 3 guillotine drop targets light up in order (similar to\nLAH).  The ball is launched into that drop target bank (and on our machine\nalways hit the center target). You simply time your shot so that it hits the\ntarget when it is lit. The speed of the rotating light does not change from\nball to ball, so it is quite easy to hit every time. You score 2M for a\nsuccessful skill shot on ball 1, 3M on ball 2, etc.\n\nBall Saver: This game has the standard DE couple of seconds ball saver.  If\nthe ball drains immediately on the skill shot, the ball will be relaunched.  If\nit drains again, then it will be launched again.  But if it drains again, you\nare doomed, since the ball saver is activated a maximum of twice.  If you are\nhaving trouble with Insta-Drain(tm), hold up the upper right flipper.  The\nautoplunged ball will hit the tip of it and bounce down to the lower right\nflipper without hitting the drop targets at all.  [Since the ball saver\nis activated to start, first go for the skill shot, let the ball drain, and\nhold up the flipper only when the ball is re-launched.]\n\nEnd-of-ball bonus is a function of ball time (actually number of switches to\nbe precise), and maxes out at 5M.  With an 8x multiplier, that can give you up\nto 40M.  The Fast Goring bonus obtained from the frenzies is also added to the\nend-of-ball bonus, but that value is not multiplied by the bonus multiplier.\n\nExtra-ball buy-in. Like many recent games, this game has an EB buy-in.  It\nworks like the Williams/Bally buy-in on games like TZ and IJ, and not like the\nprevious DE buy-in on JP, where you start a new game, but continuing with your\nmodes from the previous games. The buy-in button is below the start button.\n\nHINTS, TIPS, and STRATEGIES\nBased on which shots you can hit consistently and which you cannot, some CFs\nare easier to score with than others (e.g. for me it is much easier to score\n25M in Frightmare than in Psycho Pops, and Guillotine Targets generally score\nmuch higher than KEEPER targets). If one of the CFs that is high scoring for\nyou is flashing, then lock it in with the door handle.\n\nIf you haven't yet collected the EB, and your arcade doesn't have too many\nwizards playing the machine, then the Lite EB CF will be flashing at the start\nof each ball after the first ball. About a second after you launch the ball,\nhit the door handle to lock-in that CF before you hit any spinner, making it\nrather easy to get at least one EB during the game.\n\nDuring any multiball, shoot the right ramp to start frenzies.  You can\neasily double or triple your frenzy value by having 2 or 3 balls going.\n\nHit the captive ball during multiball to get extra balls, before all but one\nball drains. It will give you longer multiballs.\n\nShoot the spinners during frenzies; they generally score better than the pop\nbumpers. Note that the entrance to ramps are also switches, so a failed ramp\nshot scores 2 switches.\n\n- The Crypt Jam can be a big scorer, so it is worth going for all the CFs.\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\nKevin Martin (of course :-)).\n\nSPOILERS\n\n Crypt Jam  This is the award after completing all Creature Features. It is\na 6-ball multiball with the ball-saver active for 25 seconds.  Every switch\nis worth 1M for as long as you have 2 or more balls in play.

The difficulty level is about the\nsame; even though it is much easier to progress through the modes and reach\nthe final mode, the playfield is more difficult.  The game is based on the\nArabian Nights, of course, with a Lamp, a Genie, and a flying carpet ramp.\nIt has a beautiful and detailed backglass, which reminds me of a Magic card\n- can you guess which expansion it would be from? :-)\n\nSurprisingly, it is a very low scoring game.  Williams seems to have done\nwhat Mexico did a few year ago, and chop three zeroes off their \"currency\".\nScores are about one thousand times less than Attack from Mars.  Replay is\nusually around 10-20 million, high scores around 40 million or so, anything\nover 100 million is a world-class score.  Highest score I've ever seen is\nover one billion!  The font for the high scores is the same as AFM,\nthere's a lot of empty space where the billions would have been.  The game\nrolls over at one billion, good luck getting there...\n\nAnother unique thing about Tales from the Arabian Nights (TOTAN) is that it\ngoes out of its way to tell players free games are available.  Instead of\n\"Replay at...\" it flashes \"Free game at...\" at the start of the last ball.\nDuring Match, it tells the players that a free game is possible if they\nmatch.  This is a good feature for people new to pinball, who might not know\nabout the Match feature.\n\nI would like to thank the people who helped me with this.  Their names and\nemail addresses are listed at the end of this Rule Sheet.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nGoing in the standard order, clockwise from bottom left to bottom right, we\nhave:\n\n\nFlippers  two of them.  Know them.  Use them well.\n\nSlingshots and Feeder Lanes (Inlanes)  standard shape.  The Shooting Stars\nare right above the inlane entrances.\n\nOutlanes  the drains here are of medium difficulty, neither easy nor hard.\nCan be lit for a big red Special!  The outlane switches are buttons, not\nrollovers.  I wish they would have played the \"Bing\" sound from WCS when the\nbuttons are hit.  That would have been a perfect sound effect.  There's not\na lot of rubber around the outlanes, so saving will be difficult, but the\nShooting Stars will save the ball for you....\n\nShooting Stars  near both outlane entrances are spikes which shoot up out\nof the playfield and grab the ball!  They are similar to Freddy's claw in\nFreddy, but done a lot better.  If Shooting Star is lit (the white lightning\nbolt near each inlane), they will activate and try to stop the ball from\ndraining.  There is an opto on top of each of them, which is triggered\nwhenever the ball rolls near the outlanes, like the automatic Magna-Save in\nTheatre of Magic.  They work a lot better, and (finally) the software will\ncompensate when they fail to catch the ball!  This compensation is turned\noff during Multiball, unfortunately.  Also, if the opto does not register,\nthere will be no compensation -- even if the outlane button switch is hit!\nThis looks like an oversight to me.\n\nLeft Standup Targets  like the M-A-R Martian targets from AFM, they are\nright above the left inlane.  They look like red squares.  There are three\nof them, in a line vertically.  They're easy to hit with a shot off the tip\nof the right flipper, although it is a tight angle.  Hitting any one of\nthese targets will light the Shooting Star on the left.  There is a Golden\nSymbol here (only one of the three targets needs to be hit to score the\nSymbol).\n\nLeft Orbit  can be lit for Lock, Harem, or Tiger Loop.  There is a\ndiverter that will send the ball to the Jet Bumpers, otherwise the ball\nwill loop around (passing over the Lock Magnet) and come out the Right\nOrbit.  There is a Golden Symbol here.\n\nLeft Orb and Saucer  a captive ball that is behind another \"ball\" that is\nin a fixed position on the playfield.  The captive ball is hit by hitting\nthis fixed ball, which will transfer momentum to the captive ball behind it.\nIt's exactly like the Tigersaw shot in Theatre of Magic, except much lower\non the playfield (about halfway back on the playfield, \"northeast\" of the\nstandup targets).  There is a saucer in front of the fixed ball.  A shot\nthat's too weak to trigger the captive ball will land perfectly in the\nsaucer!  Ingenious!  Now if only they had thought of this on Indiana\nJones...\n\n(unnamed) Lane  this is a small lane just under the diverter in the Left\nOrbit.  If it wasn't for the diverter, the Right Orbit would exit via this\nlane.  Sometimes the ball goes into this lane anyway from the Right Orbit,\nregardless of the diverter, especially on a weak Right Orbit shot.  This\nlane is a small, tight vertical lane, kind of like the feeder to the far\nleft flipper on Road Show.  It is behind the captive ball area of the Left\nOrb.  This lane doesn't have any scoring targets on it, it's just \"there\",\nlike the lane above the top right flipper on TZ.  This lane is not directly\nshootable from the flippers.  The ball enters the top of it when a right\norbit shot is missed, and doesn't have enough momentum to come out the left\norbit.  The bottom of this lane curves sharply around to the right, and\ncomes out just below the ramp entrance.  Watch out for SDTM drains from\nhere-the ball goes slow enough exiting from here that you will have enough\ntime to prepare for a slap save.\n\nRamp  there's only one ramp on this game, but you wouldn't know it from\nplaying!  About three miles of habitrail is accessible from this ramp, which\nis explained in its own section below.  It's like the left ramp in Road\nShow- easy to hit, but to successfully make it up there requires a powerful\nflipper shot.  Can be lit for Fireball and Magic Carpet.  There is a Golden\nSymbol here.\n\n(unnamed) Standup Target  to the right of the Ramp entrance is a small\nyellow standup target.  It spots a Bazaar letter when hit.\n\nLamp  the main toy of the game.  This is ingenious.  A large Golden lamp\nis suspended on two posts, dead center in the playfield.  The posts are\nattached to opposite sides of a rotating disc.  (Think of a clock with\ntwelve numbers on it.  The lamp posts are at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock.) The\ndisc does not move on its own -- but has very low friction so that it can be\nmoved when the ball hits it!  A good shot to the posts will send the lamp\nspinning wildly, around and around!  This is explained more in its own\nsection.\n\nGenie  a big blue plastic genie, with mean-looking glowing turquoise eyes,\nis horizontally hinged in the middle so it can swing (slightly) forward and\nback.  When it is pushed back, it will register a hit.  The Genie is behind\nthe Lamp, making it a challenge to hit, even though the target itself is\nvery wide.\n\nGenie Magnet  this is a magnet just below the Genie.  When the Genie is\nhit and the game has some reason to stop the ball (such as starting a Tale),\nthis magnet will activate.  This magnet is small, though, and doesn't always\ncatch the ball.  There is rubber around the Genie which helps to deflect the\nball to this magnet.  When starting Multiball, the magnet will lower itself\ninto the playfield, taking the ball with it!\n\nHidden Treasure  offset to the right of the Genie, buried behind the Lamp,\nis a very small and obscure standup target.  It's almost impossible to see\nfrom the player's viewpoint.  I didn't know it was there until I looked\naround from the left side of the game.  When this target is hit, it\nregisters as a Genie hit.  This gives the game some slight built-in\ncompensation in case of a broken Genie.\n\nRight Standup Targets  like the Left Standup Targets, there are three of\nthem.  They are hidden behind the Lamp; I didn't even know they were there\nuntil I looked at the game from a different angle!  The targets are arranged\nin an outward curve, similar to a convex lens.  Hitting any one of these\nthree targets will light the shooting star on the right.  There is a Golden\nSymbol here!  The light for the Golden Symbol is hidden by the Lamp, making\nit very difficult to see.  It's a good idea to sometimes step over to the\nleft when playing, so you can see if this symbol is lit.\n\nLock  a difficult shot to hit, not only is it very narrow, it's also\nobscured by the Lamp.  It's a small lane that quickly bends to the left and\nmerges with the Harem Lane.  Very similar to the Lock mechanism on Twilight\nZone.  If you hit the ball in here but Lock is not lit, you will enter the\nHarem-the girls will laugh at you while giving you a small random bonus,\nbetween 7K and 50K (but usually around 20K).\n\nHarem Lane  a small vertical lane that drops down to the Lock saucer.\nBalls that are held because of Lock will stack up in this lane.\n\nLock Magnet  just above the back entrance to the Harem Lane.  The magnet\nwill intercept shots going around the Left Orbit or Right Orbit, when Lock\nis lit on them.  The magnet will then drop the ball through the Harem Lane,\nright down into the Lock saucer.  This is by far the easiest way to get a\nball locked.  When the magnet is not on, it is difficult to enter the Harem\nLane from the top, as the lane entrance is very narrow and won't stop a ball\nthat's screaming around the orbits.\n\nBazaar  a scoop, in the same position as Final Draw on WCS (but\nthankfully, it's easier to hit).  When B-A-Z-A-A-R has been spelled out on\nthe lights in front of it, the Bazaar becomes lit for a random award.  The\nBazaar can also be lit for Make A Wish.  Watch out for SDTM drains from\nhere; like Twilight Zone's Slot Machine, the Bazaar gets knocked out of\nadjustment quite easily.\n\n(unnamed) Standup Target  another small yellow standup target, to the\nright of the Bazaar entrance.  It's like that target next to the Slot\nMachine on TZ.  It spots a Bazaar letter when hit.\n\nJet Bumpers  way, way back in the far upper right corner of the game sit\nthree Jet Bumpers, lonely and neglected.  If these bumpers were any more\nseparated from the rest of the playfield, they would be outside the cabinet.\nThe diverter on the Left Orbit will allow the ball to roll there instead of\ncoming down the Right Orbit.  Also, a weak ramp shot will drop off the ramp\nand into this area.  Each bumper hit will add 1K to the Harem Jackpot\nvalue.  The game will turn off the bumpers when a timed shot is running,\nso you won't have to worry about the ball bouncing around in the bumpers\nand taking up valuable time.\n\nHarem Sneak-In  this is a small trough, close to the back edge of the\nplayfield, in the center.  It's just below the lane that leads into the Jet\nBumpers from the Right Orbit.  A lucky bounce from the Jet Bumpers will send\nthe ball here.  This will score one Harem Sneak-In, and the ball will be\nkicked out the Bazaar entrance.\n\nRight Orbit  similar to the Left Orbit, although there is no diverter\nhere.  Lock and Tiger Loop can be lit here, in addition to Extra Ball!  When\nthe Extra Ball is collected, the Lock Magnet will activate so the animation\ncan be displayed, regardless of whether or not Lock is lit (this is \"just\nfor show\" and will not count as a Lock).  When the Right Orbit is made, the\ndiverter in the Left Orbit will close, allowing the ball to come down\nthrough the Left Orbit.  There is a Golden Symbol here.\n\nRight Orb  another captive ball with a fixed ball in front of it, just\nlike the Left Orb.  There is no saucer here, though.  This shot is lower on\nthe playfield and closer to the edge of the playfield than the Left Orb.\n\n(unnamed) Lane  a lane at the far right edge of the playfield, leading\ndown from the Jet Bumpers.  Balls hit into the area with the Jet Bumpers\nwill exit via this lane (unless they go into the Harem Entrance).  This lane\nis not easily shootable by the flippers, and there are no scoring targets in\nthis lane, so ignore it.  The ball will roll down this lane, curve sharply\nto the left, and exit just below the Right Orb.\n\nPlunger and Skill Shot  the plunger is manual, like Theatre of Magic.  Now\nwe all get to see what the original prototype design for the ToM skill shot\nwas!  Instead of one hole you can shoot through to enter the playfield,\nthere are three.  They are lined up lengthwise (front to back), separated\nfrom each other by about two inches.  The plunger lane is curved upward and\nsuddenly ends, which will launch the ball slightly in the air.  The ball can\njump over holes to reach other holes that are farther back, so by carefully\nshooting the plunger, you can choose which hole you want the ball to go\nthrough.  After going through the holes, the ball will drop onto the\nhabitrail (from the Ramp) that feeds the right flipper.\n\n\nThat's it!  The playfield isn't that complicated, but it looks crowded\nbecause of the Lamp and all the Ramp habitrails.\n\nThe Ramp\nThere's only one ramp in this game, but with ramps like this, one is all you\nneed.  There are at least five possible paths the ball can take.  There's\nabout three miles of habitrail the ball can go on (I'm only exaggerating\nslightly here).\n\nWhen the ball is hit up the Ramp (on the left side of the game), it will\ncurve around the back of the game.  It will go around the Genie, loop all\nthe way around to the upper right, and pass through a diverter.  If the\ndiverter is closed, the ball will enter a spiral (like on Pin-Bot).  Unlike\nPin-Bot, the spiral is clockwise.  The spiral is one huge plastic, suspended\nabove the Jet Bumpers.  It's transparent, so it doesn't obscure the\nplayfield below it.\n\nIf the ball doesn't have enough power to clear this spiral, it will drop\ndown into the Jet Bumpers, in one of two places.  There's a high place,\nwhich will usually get some bumper action, and a low place, which will just\ntrickle down the lane below the bumpers most of the time.  If the ball makes\nit through the spiral, it will drop down onto another habitrail, which will\nreturn the ball to the right flipper.\n\nThe diverter will prevent the ball from even entering the spiral, when it is\nactive.  (It activates when there's something useful on the left side, such\nas collecting a Jewel or starting Fireball.) When the ball goes through the\nactive diverter, it is being sent back up the playfield, so considerable\nflipper power is needed to get through (the ball has looped all the way\naround and to the right by this time, so it will have lost a lot of its\nenergy).  If the ball gets through, the lane it enters will send the ball\nback around the way it came, arriving back at the upper left side of the\nplayfield.  There, it will meet up with another diverter!  It's the Spirit\nRing from Theatre of Magic, turned on its side.  (It looks like a tire.)\n\nIf a Jewel is being collected or Fireball is being started, the Spirit Ring\n(or whatever it is called now) will activate and hold the ball while the\nanimation is being played.  The ball will then be released onto another\nhabitrail, which will turn into a wireframe that crosses over the playfield\nand meets up with the habitrail that feeds the right flipper.  If the Spirit\nRing is not active, the ball will continue on the habitrail it was on, going\ndown to the left flipper.  This is one of the few ways to feed the left\nflipper in this game.\n\nSometimes, the ball will fall off the plastic spiral ramp.  This is good,\nthough, because the game will award a Secret Ball Lock!  Just like Theatre\nof Magic, a weak shot will fall into the Lock area, and the game will\nautomatically light all Locks and credit you with one!  However, on this\ngame, the animation isn't as good as ToM.  The edges of the spiral are\npositioned just over the Harem Lane, so the ball should roll down into the\nLock saucer if it falls off.  Also unlike ToM, you can get only one Secret\nBall Lock per game.\n\nThe Lamp\nThe Lamp can be spun around, and a lot of strategy in this game revolves\naround the Lamp.  Every time the lamp turns by about 180 degrees, a Lamp\nSpin is counted.  A good powerful shot to the lamp posts can score a dozen\nspins at a time on a well-maintained machine with little friction.\n\nThere are lights on the playfield which will tell you how many Lamp Spins\nyou have.  There is a winding path of fourteen blue lights.  Each spin turns\non one light.  When all fourteen are lit, spin the lamp once more and\nLightning Lamp will start (you can tell by the sound effects).  When this\nhappens, Make A Wish will light, and one Wish will be added (up to a maximum\nof three Wishes).\n\nOne of the best features of this game is that it has an actual Bonus Count\nthat counts up one by one!  Each Lamp Spin is counted, and scores 10,000\nbonus (multiplied by the bonus multiplier).  In addition to the fourteen\nlights for Lamp Spins, there are lights for \"15\", \"30\", and \"60\".  The bonus\ncount maxes out at 119, when all of these lights are lit.\n\nThe count of Lamp Spins is reset with each ball, but if you have \"15\", \"30\",\nor \"60\" lit, they will remain lit (like Centaur).  Completing the path of\nblue lights will add 15 to these numbered lights, so if you are close to\nfinishing the path, it is a good idea to try and complete it, lest you lose\nyour progress when you drain.\n\nDuring Lightning Lamp, no additional Lamp Spins will be counted.  You can\ncomplete a mode or Wish it away during Lightning Lamp, but you cannot start\na new mode during this time.\n\nLightning Lamp is a timed feature, starting at around ten seconds and\ncounting down. Each spin of the lamp will award points and reset the\nLightning Lamp timer.  Hitting the lamp really hard, for multiple spins,\nwill score a large amount of points, more so than if each spin had been\ncounted individually.  You'll know this has happened when bolts of lightning\nlight up the scoreboard, sound effects start playing, and the Lamp becomes\na spinning blur!\n\nAfter Lightning Lamp times out, the lamp returns to normal and you can work\non building up the path of blue lights again.  Every 15 Lamp Spins,\nLightning Lamp will start again.  When you max out the bonus count, you\nwon't be able to see your progress on the blue lights anymore (because they\nare all already lit), but you will still get Lightning Lamp every 15 spins.\n\nScoring for Lightning Lamp starts at a base of 250K per Lamp Spin.  Each\nadditional Lightning Lamp you start awards higher values per Lamp Spin [what\nexactly is it?  is there an upper limit?  do values still increase after\nmaxing out the bonus count?]\n\nMultiball\nTo light the Locks for Multiball, hit the Genie five times to spell out\nG-E-N-I-E.  When this is done, Lock will light up in three different\nplaces: left orbit, right orbit, and the center Lock lane.  After locking\nthe ball, the Locks will remain lit (if this is your first time playing\nMultiball during this game).  Another ball will be served to the plunger.\nLock the ball a second time and the Locks will no longer be lit, but the\nGenie will.\n\nWhen the Genie is lit, hit the Genie to activate the Genie Magnet.  After it\ncatches the ball, it will lower into the playfield, taking the ball with it.\n(If compensation is active, you can also start Multiball by hitting the\nBazaar scoop.)  The animation for the start of Multiball is neat: a gigantic\nGenie rises over a medieval Middle Eastern cityscape, and starts \"digging\"\nthrough the city, smashing buildings to bits!\n\nUnfortunately, if the Genie Magnet fails to catch the ball, the game will\nnot give you credit for hitting the Genie, and you will have to hit the\nGenie again before you can start Multiball.\n\nWhen Multiball starts, three balls will be kicked out of the Lock saucer.\nThe Genie will be lit for Jackpot!  Spinning the Lamp will increase the\nJackpot value with each spin.  If you hit the Genie, you will collect the\nJackpot, and \"Lock\" will be lit on one of the orbits.  It's either the left\norbit or the right orbit (it's random, to my knowledge).  If you make the\nlit orbit, it will relight Jackpot.  It's quite easy to hit multiple\nJackpots in this game.  I haven't discovered a Super Jackpot yet, though.\n\nThere is no compensation for missed Shooting Stars during Multiball, and no\nball saver timer at the start of Multiball, so be careful.  If you lose all\nbut one ball during Multiball, without scoring a single Jackpot, the Bazaar\nwill be lit for Rematch.  Hit the Bazaar before the timer runs out, and\nanother ball will be served to the plunger.  Multiball will then restart.\n(There are no animation or sound effects for this, it just says \"Rematch\nGranted\" in plain-looking generic text.  Seems that this wasn't finished.\nIt's so easy to score Jackpots that Rematch is almost never seen, though.)\n\nFeatures\nSkill Shot \nat the start of each ball and after each Lock, you get to take\na Skill Shot.  A snake charmer will appear on the display, and in front of\nhim there will be three baskets.  These represent the three holes.  As the\ninstruction card says, \"hit the basket with snake in it\" to collect the\nSkill Shot.  This value starts at 50K, and goes up by 25K each time the\nSkill Shot is made.  It maxes out at 125K.  You don't get to take a\nSkill Shot if you are re-shooting the ball because it was saved (because\nof Shooting Star compensation, or otherwise).\n\nNote that the Skill Shot targets are not very reliable.  They will\nfrequently fail to register hits.  Sometimes they will even credit you for a\nhit when you miss!  Assuming they work, here is how to consistently hit each\nbasket:\n\n\nTop basket  Pull the plunger all the way back, and launch the ball at full\nstrength.  (Not too hard, though, or the ball will rebound off the back\nguardrail and you will miss)\n\nMiddle basket  Once you have memorized the plunger strength necessary to hit\nthe top and bottom baskets, try to average their strength and go for the\nmiddle.  This is by far the most difficult basket to hit.\n\nBottom basket  This is the easiest basket to hit.  You have unlimited\nchances to retry the shot if it is too weak.  Take advantage of this by\nlaunching the ball very gently, so that it fails to clear the launch ramp.\nGradually increase the force until the ball just barely clears the ramp,\nentering the bottom basket.\n\n\nSuper Skill Shot\nif the Skill Shot is made, the Super Skill Shot will\nbecome available.  As the ball rolls to the flipper, the Ramp will light.\nHit the Ramp immediately.  The display will show \"Super Skill Shot\" and\naward twice the value of the Skill Shot.  This is in addition to the Skill\nShot award that already been collected.  (Thus, making the Super Skill Shot\neffectively triples your Skill Shot.)\n\nTiger Loops/Extra Ball\nthere are two ways to light an Extra Ball that I\nhave found.  After making a certain number of Tiger Loops (usually six), the\nExtra Ball will light.  The second way to light it is to collect a certain\nnumber of Jewels (usually four).  It's a good idea to choose the Jewels\nduring Make A Wish, just so you can light this Extra Ball.\n\nEach inlane lights the opposite Tiger Loop orbit shot, like the Freeways on\nHigh Speed.  They are an easy shot when the ball is fed to the flipper.\nEach orbit will continue to remain lit if it is repeatedly hit (like the\nright orbit on Terminator 2).  On some machines, it is very easy to\nrepeatedly loop the orbits, scoring Tiger Loops each time.  If you can do\nthis, definitely do it, as it is easy to light the Extra Ball this way.\nA second Extra Ball will light if you can get 20 Tiger Loops!  (Rumor has\nit there is yet another Extra Ball at 40 or 50 Tiger Loops?)\n\nTiger Loops may not be lit during a Mode that uses the orbits.\nUnfortunately, this is also true of a lot of other shots as well; Modes\nprevent many features from being scored.\n\nHarem Multiball \nthe Jet Bumpers will sometimes send the ball into the\nHarem Sneak-In, as described earlier.  If you do this three times, Harem\nMultiball will be started.  Another ball will be served to the plunger.\nDuring this Multiball, every shot will score the Harem \"Jackpot\"!  Since\nthe \"Jackpot\" starts at a very small value (10,000, or 25,000 if your\nmachine is on easier settings), it is a good idea to boost it up in\nthe Jet Bumpers before starting Harem Multiball.\n\nHarem \nHarem Multiball can also be started by spelling H-A-R-E-M.  When\nHarem is lit at the Left Orbit, one of the letters in this word will be\nadded when that shot is made.  The diverter will also open, sending the ball\ninto the Jet Bumpers area.  Make five Harem shots to start Harem Multiball.\nHarem will always be lit at the start of each ball.  The Harem shot is\nstrange: it will relight on its own, but not until every other possible\nshot (Tiger Loops, Jet Bumpers, etc.) at the Left Orbit has timed out.\nCradling the ball on the flipper is a good way to light Harem.\n\nBonus \nAfter so many games without it, the bonus count finally makes a\ncomeback!  Watch as the game plays music in time with each Lamp Spin you\nhave accumulated, up to 119!  It's not quite Swords Of Fury, but the\nbonus music is still neat to hear, especially when you watch the blue path\ncount down your bonus on the playfield.  The bonus count is very important\nin this game!  Here are the scoring totals:\n\n\n Each Lamp Spin (max 119) -- 10,000\n Each Genie hit -- 10,000\n Each Jewel collected -- 50,000\n\n\nall times the Bonus X (max 12X[?]).\n\nTo increase the Bonus X, fully hit the lit captive ball.  Each full captive\nball hit adds 1 to the Bonus X.  The maximum is 12X [operator adjustable?\npossibly as high as 28X?].  Even if it is maxed, it still may be possible\nto increase it via the \"3 multipliers\" Bazaar award.  Bonus X resets to 1X\nwith each ball (unless held by the \"Hold Bonus X\" Bazaar award).  Some\nmodes (like Cyclops), unfortunately, preempt the awarding of Bonus X when\nthe captive balls are hit.  (If your game is set to hard settings, only\none captive ball will be lit at a time, alternating between left and right\nas the slingshots are hit.)\n\nNotice that hitting the Genie when he isn't lit for anything else will add\n10K to your bonus.  This is not worth going for, the Lamp is much more\nlucrative and easier to hit. The Jewel bonus is also insignificant, except\nafter getting many Jewels, but by then your score will be so high that the\nJewels won't make an impact.  The maximum bonus possible through the Lamp is\n14,280,000 (119 * 12X), higher than the replay score on most machines! So\nspinning the Lamp and cranking up that Bonus is very important.\n\nBazaar \nThis is a small random award, like Stroke of Luck on AFM.  There\nare six huge, brightly lit lights on the playfield which spell B-A-Z-A-A-R.\nWhen all six letters are lit, the Bazaar scoop will award a random award.\nAt game start, Bazaar will be lit automatically [operator adjustable?].\nAfter Bazaar is collected, you will need to spell it to light it again.\nLetters are lit by hitting the Bazaar scoop when it is unlit, or by hitting\na Standup Target: 3 letters per hit until Bazaar is lit again, then\nthen 2 letters per hit until Bazaar is lit yet another time, then only 1\nletter per hit thereafter.\n\nHere are the Bazaar awards I have seen:\n\n\n Light Extra Ball (very rare, only seen during a \"poor\" game)\n Extra Ball (outright award, also very rare)\n 3 Multipliers (adds 3 to your Bonus X)\n 15 Lamp Spins (also adds a Wish, but does not start Lightning Lamp)\n 250K\n 500K (\"Big points\".  Hah.)\n Hold Bonus X\n Light Locks\n Start Multiball (only if 2 balls are already locked)\n Light Make A Wish\n Light Shooting Stars\n\n\nAfter collecting a Bazaar award, the lights will reset.  When Make A Wish is\nlit at the Bazaar scoop, the Bazaar award cannot be collected.\n\nMake A Wish \nThe Bazaar scoop is also used for Make A Wish, which is much\nmore valuable than any Bazaar award (except Light Extra Ball).  When Make A\nWish is hit, you will be given two choices: Jewels, or a random award.\nThe left flipper will be lit for one Jewel, or two Jewels if the Ruby is lit.\nThe right flipper will be lit for a random award.  The Ruby will turn off\nafter making your Wish, so definitely use it to grab the two Jewels when you\nhave the chance!  (If you have already collected all Jewels, the left flipper\nwill be lit for Start Genie Battle!)\n\nThe random awards I have seen are more valuable than Bazaar awards, but\nmost are still not as important as getting Jewels:\n\n\n Collect Bonus\n 3X Fireball Value (usually appears during the Fireball countdown)\n 3X Lamp Scoring (usually appears when Lightning Lamp is running)\n Lightning Lamp\n 3 Tiger Loops\n Extra Ball (also very rare and seen only during a \"poor\" game)\n\n\nIf Make A Wish is hit during a feature (such as Lightning Lamp), the\n\"random\" award will be something related to the feature (such as 3X Lamp\nScoring).\n\n[I don't know much about these awards, because I rarely choose them.  I\nalways pick the Jewels, unless I'm 3 Tiger Loops away from an Extra Ball!\nI know there must be more awards than this.  Is is possible for the Extra\nBall award to be lit on the left side, instead of a Jewel?]\n\nFireball \nA countdown award.  When the purple light is lit on the Ramp,\nhitting the Ramp will start Fireball.  The award for Fireball will be shown,\nquickly dropping down (like Thing Multiball on TAF).  You will have about 20\nseconds to hit the Genie, before the countdown drops to zero.  It can be\ndifficult, especially if the Lamp gets in the way.  Fireball is lit by\nlanding in the saucers a number of times, usually one or two (indicated on\nthe display).  After each Fireball, the number of saucer hits necessary to\nlight it again goes up by one.\n\nThe base value for each Fireball is 400K.  Another 200K will be added each\ntime you land in the saucers, so the later Fireballs (which require many\nsaucer hits) can be worth big points.  Hitting the Ramp again during\nFireball will add 200K to the countdown, but will not raise the countdown\nabove its starting value.\n\nMake A Wish will always give a choice of \"3X Fireball Value\" if Make A Wish\nis hit during the Fireball countdown.  Other Make A Wish awards may also be\nkeyed to whatever is running at the time.\n\nShooting Stars \nthe Shooting Stars are your FRIENDS.  They will save the\nball from draining down the outlanes!\n\nWhen lit, the Shooting Stars will shoot out of the playfield and capture the\nball!  A circular arrangement of metal pins will shoot out of the area just\nabove the outlanes and inlanes.  They will attempt to catch the ball,\nreleasing it to the inlane if they succeed.  If they fail to catch the ball,\nthe game will compensate by letting you reshoot the drained ball!  This\ncompensation is turned off during Multiball, unfortunately.  Watch out for\nairballs caused by the metal pins lifting the ball as they shoot upward.\n\nHit the left bank of Standup Targets to light the left Shooting Star.  Hit\nthe right bank of Standup Targets, behind and to the right of the Lamp, to\nlight the right Shooting Star.  The right one is much harder to light than\nthe left, because of the placement of the targets.  Beware of this, since\nright drains are common in this game.\n\nThe Shooting Stars are almost exactly like Hocus Pocus in Theatre Of Magic.\nThey are timed, and you can't reset this timer until the time runs out. When\nthe Shooting Stars are used, surprisingly, they will remain lit!  So, get in\nthe habit of relighting them every so often, to protect you from drains.\n\nRuby \nalso known as the Necklace, it will cause Make A Wish to award _two_\njewels instead of just one!  To light the Ruby, you must have Make A Wish\nalready lit, and one of the Shooting Stars already lit, at the time you\nlight the other Shooting Star.\n\nWhen these three things have all been lit, a female voice will say \"My ruby\nis yours!\".  The Ruby is a small vertical red light, just above the Mode\nlights, between the woman's two breasts.  When it is lit, it will flicker\nsporadically -- it looks like the bulb is loose, but this is just a display\neffect.  The Ruby will go away at the end of each ball, and is also used up\nwhen you collect the two Jewels during Make A Wish.\n\nTales (Modes)\nThere are seven Modes in this game, representing seven Tales of the Arabian\nNights.  There is one Jewel associated with each Mode.  To collect the Jewel\nfor each mode, you must complete whatever is required for the Mode, then hit\nthe Ramp.  The red \"Flying Carpet\" light at the Ramp entrance will become\nlit, to let you know the Jewel is ready to be collected.  Only one Mode can\nbe running at a time.  Modes are not timed, and are carried over from ball\nto ball!  If you lose the ball, the Mode will continue off where it was, on\nyour next ball.  When you finally do complete the Mode, you can not start\nthe next one until you have collected its Jewel.\n\nLike many recent games, there is one generic symbol that can be lit on all\nmajor shots (e.g. ST:TNG's Starfleet emblems) that tells you what to aim for\nwhen playing a Mode.  On this game, this symbol is a yellow circle\ncontaining a strange-looking figure (that reminds me of the Running Man from\nthat old movie).\n\nThere are five of these Golden Symbols throughout the playfield, on these\nshots:\n\n\n The Left bank of Standup Targets\n The Left Orbit\n The Ramp\n The Right Orbit\n The Right bank of Standup Targets (the ones hidden behind the Lamp, this\n Symbol is very difficult to see)\n\n\nThe \"Mode Start\" light is difficult to see.  Just below and to the left of\nthe Genie Magnet, there is a picture of the Princess trapped in a bottle.\nThere are lights below this picture, which will make it slowly pulsate on\nand off.  When this is going on, you can hit the Genie to start a Mode.\nMode Start is lit at the start of the game.  To light it again after\nstarting a mode, you must first collect that mode's Jewel (by hitting the\nRamp).\n\nAt the start of each ball, you may choose which Mode is lit, if no mode is\nalready running.  Hit the left flipper to cycle through the modes and choose\nwhich one you want.  (This also works on Theatre of Magic!) The Mode that is\nlit will change when the slingshots are hit, so if you want to start the\nMode you have chosen, you should hit the Genie as quickly as possible after\nstarting the ball.\n\nMake A Wish is very important in progressing through the game.  It spots\nmodes for you!  One of the choices in Make A Wish will always be \"Collect A\nJewel\".  IMHO, you should always choose this, especially when the Ruby\nchanges it to \"Collect Two Jewels\"!  If a mode is in progress, that mode\nwill be automatically ended and you will be given the Jewel for that mode\n(and the next mode as well, if you are collecting two jewels).  Otherwise,\nthe currently selected Mode will be awarded.  Whenever you collect a Jewel,\neither by Make A Wish or by hitting the Ramp, everything that was lit\nbecause of that mode will become unlit.\n\nThe seven Modes are, from left to right:\n\n\nSinbad (and the Rocs)  The Jet Bumpers come alive in this Mode.  The left\norbit will light, and the diverter will open, always sending the ball to the\nJet Bumpers.  Each bumper hit will smash one Roc (a bird of unusual size),\nsending feathers flying all over the display and making a very satisfying\nsound effect.  You only need to hit one bumper to light the Jewel, the\nadditional Rocs are just for fun (and points)!\n\nAli Baba  What's the magic word to open the cave?  Both banks of standup\ntargets will become lit.  Hitting any of these targets will spot one letter\nin S-E-S-A-M-E.    This is a hard mode, you might want to Wish it away.\nWhen the word is spelled, a great voice firmly yells \"OPEN SESAME!\".  The\ncave opens, revealing the Jewel inside.\n\nFlying Horse  Five statues will appear on the screen.  Each of the five\nGolden Symbols represents one statue.  Smash the statues by hitting them.\nThe prize you need to complete the Mode is randomly hidden inside one of the\nstatues (usually it is the last statue you hit, unfortunately).  Find the\nstatue to light the Jewel.  This is also a hard mode, another one to\nWish away.\n\nScheherazade  The most difficult thing about this Mode is spelling its\nname.  All Symbols will light, and all you need to do is hit one of them.\nAfter this, you can either keep hitting the Symbols for points, or end\nthe mode by collecting the Jewel.\n\nCamel Race  To win the tale of the great camel race, \"hit yellow shots to\nget ahead\".  All five Golden Symbols will become lit.  Hit them enough\ntimes [usually 4 or 5, operator adjustable?] to complete the mode.  It\ndoesn't matter which Symbol you hit; repeated hits to one Symbol are OK.\nDon't stand behind the camels after they've just eaten :-)\n\nFlying Carpet (Forty Thieves)  \"FLY... on your magic carpet!\"  This mode\nis my favorite one, and it's easy.  The Flying Carpet becomes lit on the\nRamp.  Hit the Ramp, and that's it!  The next Ramp shot will collect your\nJewel.\n\nCyclops  \"Into the orbs!\"  Strangely enough, the Golden Symbols aren't\nused in this mode.  Hit one of the Captive Balls, or land in the saucer next\nto the left Captive Ball, to launch an Orb at the Cyclops and hit him in the\nhead with it (ouch!).  Like the Rocs, you only need to do this once, but it\nwill remain lit so you can get extra points from it.  The points for hitting\neach Cyclops advance with each Cyclops hit during the mode: starting at 10K,\nthey increase by 10K each time (to 20K, 30K, etc.).\n\nGenie Battle  This is the wizard mode in the game.  You can't get this\nuntil you have all seven Jewels in your hot little hands.  This is a\ntwo-stage event, like Wet Willie's in Whitewater.  When you get the seventh\nJewel, the Genie will become lit, to start the first stage.  The red \"Genie\nBattle\" light between the flippers will start to eerily flicker, just like\nthe Ruby.\n\nWhen you start this mode, you get a really cool animation.  The Princess\ncries out to you, trapped in her bottle, but the Genie pulls a dirty trick:\nhe takes her away and summons many Skeletons to fight you.  The Golden\nSymbols will become lit.  Hitting each Golden Symbol will kill one Skeleton.\nHitting the Orbs will also kill a Skeleton.\n\nThe Genie will summon more Skeletons to replace the ones you have killed.\nIf you drain during this stage, you will continue where you left off, on\nyour next ball.  After defeating many Skeletons (typically somewhere around\n6 to 8), the game will lock the ball and serve another one to the plunger.\nThe final Skeleton will always be a shot that the game can use to lock the\nball, typically the orbits.  [Hitting the Genie may also sometimes spot a\nSkeleton, early on in the battle?]\n\nAfter locking the ball, the game will display \"Unlimited Balls Until Someone\nWins\".  Shoot the ball, and the final Genie Battle will start!  More balls\nwill be served to the plunger, even while you have these two in play, up to\nthe maximum number of balls the game holds (four).  The Shooting Stars\nwill always be active during the Battle [operator adjustable?].\n\nIf you drain during this stage, the ball will be instantly sent back to the\nplunger.  Immediately launch all of these balls, you will be penalized\nif you don't!  It helps to have a friend launch the balls for you, so you\ncan concentrate on playing.  (This is like the final mode in World Cup\nSoccer.)\n\nThe scoreboard will be locked on only one thing during this final multiball\nmode: your epic struggle to rescue the Princess from the evil Genie!  The\nGenie appears on the left, you on the right, and spinning in the space\nbetween them is the bottle containing the trapped Princess.  All five shots\nwill light.  Keep hitting these shots to pull the Princess slightly closer\nto you.  [The Genie, and other targets, might also have an effect?] The\nGenie will steadily pull the Princess closer to him.  Do not keep a ball\nresting in the plunger lane, or the Genie will pull the Princess over\nfaster.  Balls will frequently drain, because the Shooting Stars are\ncompletely disabled during this final battle.\n\nWhen either you or the Genie finally grab hold of the Princess, the mode\nwill stop and the flippers will go dead.  Every ball on the playfield will\ndrain, just like TZ resetting itself after Lost In The Zone.  If you have\nrescued the Princess, you've won!  You will be awarded 20,000,000 points!\n(This is a huge amount on this game.  Think of getting 20 billion on AFM.) I\nwon't spoil the beautiful ending sequence here...  If you weren't this lucky\n(and even if you were), you get to try again: another ball will be served to\nthe plunger.  (If a ball has been left in the plunger lane, you get to use\nthat one, another ball won't be launched.) Now, all you have to do is get\nthe seven Jewels again... You'll probably get another game in which to do\nit, because the Specials will now be lit!\n\n\nStrategies\nThe key to this game is BONUS.  Spinning the Lamp (racking up Lamp Spins) is\nthe best way to get a lot of bonus.  Since the count of Lamp Spins drops\ndown to the nearest multiple of 15 when you drain, concentrate on hitting\nthe Lamp when you notice your Lamp Spins are getting close to one of these\n15-count thresholds.  The blue path is helpful for this, but it maxes at 14,\nnot 15... you will know you have crossed a 15-count threshold when the\nthunderclap sound effect starts for Lightning Lamp.\n\nMake A Wish also lights at the same time Lightning Lamp starts (every 15\nLamp Spins).  Go for this!  The Bazaar shot is dangerous, often rebounding\ndown the drain if you miss, so shooting for the Bazaar is only worthwhile\nwhen Make A Wish is lit.\n\nYou can store up to three Wishes.  Try to save your Wishes until they will\ndo the most good (e.g. when you have lit the Ruby).  If you are on your last\nball, however, definitely collect your Wishes as soon as possible!\n(Especially if you haven't lit the Extra Ball from the fourth Jewel yet!)\nAlways choose to collect Jewels from Make A Wish, unless you are getting\nclose to an Extra Ball and need those 3 Tiger Loops.  The other random\nawards just aren't worth it, compared to Jewels (and the Genie Battle\nthey lead to).\n\nDon't shoot Make A Wish if you already have a Jewel lit at the Ramp.  Make A\nWish will collect that Jewel, which is a waste, because the Ramp is much\neasier to hit than the Bazaar scoop.  Go for Make A Wish right after you\nget that Jewel on the ramp.\n\nIf you shoot Make A Wish when no Mode is running, you will not have to play\nthe Mode, you will immediately be given the Jewel for it!  This is the best\ntime to shoot Make A Wish.  During the Wish animation, you can quickly hit\nthe left flipper to change the lit Mode, so you can choose which Mode you\nwant to Wish away!\n\nTry to get into a \"groove\" where you can consistently hit the Genie (to\nstart modes), the Ramp (to finish modes and collect Jewels), and the\nBazaar scoop (Make A Wish).  Like that old Daffy Duck cartoon, you'll\nsoon be hauling away mounds of Jewels from Ali Baba's cave!\n\nWhen you're playing Modes, you might want to avoid Make A Wish if you are in\nan easy mode (e.g. Flying Carpet), so you can save your Wishes for when you\nreally need them.  When you're in a hard mode (Rocs, for instance, on a\nmachine with weak Jet Bumpers), just close your eyes and Wish that mode\naway! (you might need to open your eyes to hit the Bazaar scoop, unless your\nname is Tommy)\n\nOccasionally, it may be worthwhile to not collect the Jewel from Make\nA Wish.  If \"3 Tiger Loops\" is lit and you are close to an Extra Ball, get\nthat.  If \"Collect Bonus\" is lit, get it if you have racked up a large\nBonus and a high Bonus X.  Getting \"3X Lamp Scoring\" is very helpful if\nMultiball is lit, because of all the Lamp activity during Multiball.\n\nThe bonus count is held over from ball to ball, like the classic KISS\nmachine.  Because of this, try especially hard to \"rub the lamp\" during your\nfirst ball(s)!  The bonus count will stick with you for every ball you have\nafter that, so you will be effectively multiplying your bonus count, because\nyou get to collect it at the end of each ball.\n\nIf bonus count is important, Bonus X is even more important.  On your last\nball(s), do everything in your power to crank up the Bonus X!  Because bonus\ncount has been building up over the course of the entire game, getting a\nhigh Bonus X on the last ball is very lucrative.  \"Hold Bonus X\" from the\nBazaar is too random an award to count on, unfortunately.  Bonus X maxes out\nat 12X [or more? operator adjustable?], and the game does not tell you when\nyou've maxed it out, so if the captive balls suddenly stop responding (and\nyou're not in any Mode that would cause this), assume you've maxed it out\nand work on the Lamp (if you haven't already maxed that too).  Trap the\nball and hold the flipper for a Status Report if you aren't sure.  Also, on\nyour last ball, check the Replay score in the Status Report to see if you're\ngetting close...  (or GC score, or rollover score, or whatever)\n\nWhen Lightning Lamp is running, you can not collect any more Lamp Spins,\neven if you spin the Lamp!  You have to wait for Lightning Lamp to time out,\nand the blue path to reset.  The points awarded for Lightning Lamp are worth\na lot, but if your bonus is greater than around 7X or so, you might want to\njust trap the ball and wait for Lightning Lamp to end.  Also, keep in mind\nthat bonus count is held over from ball to ball, when deciding whether to\ncollect points now (Lightning Lamp) or later (Bonus/Lamp Spins).\n\nThe position of the Lamp's posts will determine what happens when they are\nhit:\n\nWhen the two posts are aligned vertically (e.g. at \"12:00\" and \"6:00\", if\nthe Lamp was a clock, facing the player), it will be very difficult to get\ngood Lamp action (and lots of Lamp Spins) out of it.  It's difficult to\nknock the Lamp back into the (better) horizontal position using the\nflippers, it's best to wait for a lucky rebound from the Genie and other\ntargets to hit the Lamp.  Those other targets will also be much easier to\nhit, because the Lamp won't be blocking them as much!  The right bank of\nStandup Targets, the Lock, and the Genie all become easy shots when the Lamp\nis in this position.  Do not aim for the Lamp when it is aligned vertically,\nit becomes an immobile SDTM drain monster.\n\nWhen the two posts are aligned horizontally (at \"9:00\" and \"3:00\"), the\nGenie (and all those other back-playfield shots) are almost completely\nblocked, but the Lamp is ripe for a good solid whacking!  Hit one of the\nposts as hard as you can, with a good firm shot from the flippers.  If the\nLamp doesn't have a lot of friction and the flippers are strong, you can\ncomplete the blue path in a single shot...  If you're feeling lucky, you can\nalso try to send the ball right between the two posts; it will go directly\ninto the Genie!  If one of these horizontally-aligned posts is slightly\nfarther back from the other (e.g. \"10:00\"), aim for the post that's farthest\nback.  This will help ensure that the ball doesn't take a bad hop from the\npost and drain.\n\nDuring Multiball, the Lamp is very easy to hit.  Use this to your advantage\nby starting Multiball when the blue path isn't lit very much.  By the time\nMultiball ends, it should have been fully completed at least once!  In\nMultiball, all the rebounds of the balls help to push the Lamp around into\nconvenient positions, often completing several Lamp Spins in the process.\n\nHarem Multiball might be good for a few extra points, especially if you have\na game with good Jet Bumpers.  Trapping the ball and waiting will cause\nHarem to light after a while, most of the time.  Use this to your advantage,\nby hitting Harem when it lights.\n\nIn the final Genie Battle multiball, with unlimited balls, whack the Genie!\nIt will hurt him and cause him to loosen his grip on the bottle if you whack\nhim enough, allowing the bottle to slide over to your side where you can\ngrab it and win.  Also, you don't need to worry about the Lamp deflecting\nyour ball down the drain, you have unlimited balls!  You can also hit the\nleft bank of Standup Targets, they are another easy shot during this battle,\nand they also will rebound into other useful stuff like the right Standup\nTargets and the Lamp!\n\nMany of the features in the game are not collectible if another feature is\nalready lit on the same shot.  The game gives out only one award at a time,\nit seems.  Watch out for this when planning shots.  Shooting the Orbs during\nCyclops mode will not give Bonus X.  Bazaar will not be awarded if Make A\nWish is lit there.  Tiger Loops will be ignored when Harem is lit [and\npossibly also during the Fireball countdown].  Many other items are like\nthis.  I wish this game was like IJ and AFM, where you can hit one shot and\nwatch multiple awards pile up!  Can't have it all, I guess...\n\nMiscellaneous\nCows?  When you are getting Bazaar awards, quickly hit both flippers to\nstop the animations.  Do this for three Bazaar awards, and the fourth one\nwill then award A New Cow, worth one million points!\n\nThere may also be another way to get A New Cow: if you start the Great\nCamel Race while Bazaar is lit, and make the first Symbol shot, you will\nhear a \"moo\".  Immediately shoot the Bazaar, hit both flippers to stop\nthe animation, and get A New Cow.\n\nIf you are an operator of this machine, and your Genie magnet is dropping\nballs SDTM instead of deflecting them as it should, you can make an\nadjustment on your machine's settings to enable compensation.  Change\nFeature Adjustment A2.22 (GENIE BALL SAVE) to YES.  It defaults to a setting\nof NO compensation, unfortunately.\n\nThe game has some compensation on the Ramp for weak flippers.  If\ncompensation is active, you can score Super SKill Shot merely by hitting\nthe ramp entry switch (without needing to go all the way around the Ramp).\nIf a diverter is not registering, the game will know what to do and\nstart the correct feature, even if the ball is in the \"wrong\" place.\n\nIn you are playing a beta game, there are a few differences between it\nand the released game.  You can recognize a beta by the Skill Shot: on\na beta, it will have two snakes in it, and you are trying to hit\nthe one empty basket!  The Ruby will also be much harder (perhaps\nimpossible?) to light.  You should ask your operator to upgrade\nthe ROM's to the released version.\n\nIt's possible to get a lucky airball during Multiball, and bounce the\nball back into the plunger lane.  If this happens, you get to play a\none-ball Multiball, and save the other ball for later!  (This trick\nalso works in Corvette and Theatre Of Magic!)\n\nIn case it's too loud in your arcade to hear it, this is what the Genie\nis saying at game start: \"In ancient Baghdad, a most beautiful\nPrincess was imprisoned by the evil genie Saleem Bagazi...\"\n\nDuring a multiplayer game, if one player starts Multiball, all other players\nwill lose their locked balls!  They will have to be relocked again, there\nis no compensation for this.  So, if you're in a multiplayer game and you\nlock a ball, concentrate on locking the others before you drain!\n\nChanges\nI neglected this Rule Sheet for almost a year before finally updating\nit.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Taxi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Taxi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAXI is copyright Williams 1988.\n This rulesheet is released to\nthe public domain by Mark Valentine.\n\n\nIt's my first shot at a rulesheet, so picking a simple game\nseemed like a good idea...\n\nThe rules specified here assume 'medium' difficulty settings\n(the default).\n\nPlayfield Description\nTAXI comes in a standard-sized cabinet painted New York taxi\nyellow. As with just about every table, the art is great if you\nactually take the time to inspect it in detail.\n\n\nPlunger  A manual plunger feeds the ball into the SPINOUT\nsaucer. The strength of the plunge will affect how many times\nthe ball spins around. Point awards, based on the number of\nrevolutions are: 1k, 5k, 10k, 25k + pickup passenger, 50k, 75k,\n100k. Beyond that it wraps around and starts at 1k again. This\nvalue is multiplied by the number of the ball in play (not on\nhard settings [or on my machine]). I find this an unbalancing\nfeature, particularly on 5-ball play where it's possible to\nscore most of a replay just on this skill shot.\n\nRollovers  There are 3 rollover lanes at the top centre,\nlabeled C A B. Lighting all 3 letters advances bonus multiplier\n(up to max. 5x, after which C A B awards 50k 'CAB Bonus') and\nalso lights 'Raise Jackpot' for 10 seconds.\n\nJOYRIDE eject hole  To the left of the rollover lanes is the\nJOYRIDE hole. It is accessible from both above and below. Above\nby a right 'semi-orbit' shot, below directly from the flippers.\n>From above it counts as GORBY pickup and 'collect jackpot'; from\nbelow it's SANTA pickup and collects JOYRIDE when lit (by right\ninlane). Finally it collects the AIRPORT MILLION when lit.\n\nCarry Passengers target  Immediately to the right of the JOYRIDE\nhole. Lit for about 10 seconds by making all three LOLA or the\nPINBOT drop banks (whether lit or not). Available from both\nflippers, but much easier from a left backhand.\n\nLeft Ramp  The entrance is halfway down the playfield. If lit\n(done by right inlane), scores current AIRPORT value and\nadvances it. Also starts multiball if a ball is locked. A weak\nshot may roll back and drain.\n\nRight Ramp  The entrance is halfway down the playfield. If lit\n(done by left inlane), scores current AIRPORT value and advances\nit.\n\nLOLA drop targets  Bank of three located centre of the\nplayfield. All three have to be hit within 10 seconds or they\nreset. Pickup LOLA when lit. Lights 'Carry Passengers'.\n\nPINBOT drop targets  Bank of three located centre right. All\nthree have to be hit within 15 seconds or they reset. Pickup\nPINBOT when lit. Lights 'Carry Passengers'.\n\nDRAC hole  Located centre left at the end of a U-loop. Pickup\nDRAC when lit. Collect extra ball when lit (by 3 x C A B).\nCatapult shoots the ball to the right ramp> This will score the\nAIRPORT value if lit, but if DRAC is lit (and collected) the\nAIRPORT award will time out before the eject.\n\nLock hole  Centre right, above the PINBOT bank. A simple shot to\nlock a ball. After the first multiball, any passenger must be\ncollected to relight it for lock.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nPickup all 5 passengers to light JACKPOT. Collect JACKPOT. Drop\noff all 5 passengers to light outlanes for SPECIAL.\n\nAt the start of the game PINBOT and GORBY are lit for pickup.\nWhen a passenger is picked up, the next one lights. The order is\nGORBY, PINBOT, DRAC, LOLA, SANTA. Each pickup awards a tip of\n20k and also gives an end of ball bonus of 20k.\n\nJACKPOT starts at 500k. Each time C A B is scored, 'Raise\nJackpot' lights for 10 seconds, during which time every switch\nadds 2k to the jackpot value. The jackpot value is held over\nfrom player to player, ball to ball and game to game until\ncollected. Maximum value is 4M. The jackpot must be collected\nwithin 15 seconds or LOLA get out and has to be picked up again\nto relight the jackpot.\n\nOnce the jackpot is collected, drop off passengers in the order\nSANTA, PINBOT, DRAC, LOLA, GORBY. This will relight the jackpot\n(although it probably won't have been raised much over 600k) and\none (alternating) outlane for SPECIAL.\n\nAfter collecting the drop-off jackpot, it starts over with GORBY\n(only one passenger lit at once for second and subsequent\ntimes). A second complete pickup/drop off sequence does not\nlight the second outlane for special.\n\nAIRPORT\nLeft inlane lights right ramp, right inlane lights left ramp for\nAIRPORT. Shooting a lit ramp awards the current airport value\nand advances it. Values are 20k, 40k, 60k, 80k and finally 100k\n+ light airport million (collected at JOYRIDE hole). No time\nlimit to collect the million (20 seconds on 'hard', 15 seconds\non 'extra hard').\n\nJOYRIDE\nRight inlane lights the JOYRIDE hole for about 10 seconds.\nShooting it awards one of the awards shown on the backglass: 10k\n(bleah!); Spot Passenger; Mystery (points between 60k and 290k);\nExtra Ball (awarded immediately); Special.\n\nMultiball\nAchieved by locking one ball in the right lock hole and shooting\nthe left ramp with a subsequent ball. This carries over from\nplayer to player, so it is possible to steal someone else's\nlocked ball! When multiball starts, the objective is to relock\nboth balls in the 'Express' lanes. First lock must be back into\nthe right lock hole (Express lane 1). Second ball must be shot\ninto DRAC (Express lane 2). Locking the second ball scores 300k.\nBoth balls are then ejected and both ramps are lit for 100k\n'Airport Ride'.\n\nExtra Ball\n2 possibilities; JOYRIDE extra ball or C A B extra ball. C A B\nextra ball requires 3 C A B's during the same ball (2 on 'extra\neasy, 6 on 'hard', 7 on 'extra hard'). Collected at DRAC. If the\nball is lost before collecting it, tough!\n\nCARRY PASSENGERS\nHitting this small target (lit by LOLA or PINBOT banks) holds\nany passengers for the next ball. Subsequent 'carry passenger'\nshots on the same ball award 20k, 30k, 50k (max.) 'Carry Bonus'.\nIf you 'carry passengers' on the final ball, you get a extra end\nof ball bonus ('Passenger Payoff') of 20k per passenger.\n\nEnd of Ball Bonus\nThe ball bonus is displayed on the backglass. Most shots (ramps,\nholes, inlanes) add a few k to the bonus. Maximum is 99k. E-O-B\nbonus is calculated as bonus * bonus multiplier + 20k per\npassenger. Therefore the maximum possible bonus is 99k * 5 + 20k\n* 5 = 595k. Note that if you are not credited for passengers\npicked up in a previous sequence; if you pickup all 5, collect\nthe jackpot, drop off Santa and drain you are credited with one\npassenger (SANTA), not 6 passengers. This seems a bit mean,\nconsidering the passenger bonus isn't huge anyway.\n\nTACTICS\nGet the jackpot. Nothing else scores anything like as many\npoints. Always aim for Carry Passengers to make life easier.\nMultiball is easy to get, but difficult to milk for many points\nas the ramps are quite difficult; anything less than a perfect\nshot will roll back down dangerously. Multiball is a good time\nto pickup PINBOT (and LOLA) with two balls flying around.\nIf you can master the ramps, the airport million is well worth\ngoing for. If the left ramp is difficult, shoot DRAC instead as\nthat awards a left ramp airport advance.\n\nBragging\nThis section seems obligatory in rulesheets, although I don't\nhave much to brag about. I have covered the high score board on\nmy, hem, local Taxi, #1 being a scrappy 6.6M.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Tee'd Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Tee'd Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiled by Robert Macauley\n\nVersion 1.1\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe following is a rough guide to playing the Gottlieb Premier pinball\nTee'd Off. If all goes to plan and this gets posted on the net at a later\ndate, some people may wonder why the hell anyone would bother doing a rule\nsheet for a game that is over 5 years old. The simple answer is that this\nwas done as an assessment for a course I was doing and my mind went blank\nwith regard to something to write. Now for the legal stuff. Tee'd Off is\na trademark of Gottlieb Premier and I guess they would still worry about\ncopyright, despite the fact that they are now out of business. This guide\nis released as freeware. Use it however you like just as long as I still\nget credit for it's existence and no profit is made from it's use.\nPlayfield Layout\nStarting from the drain and moving clockwise around the playfield:\nInlanes/Outlanes: The usual. The outlanes are always lit for Hole In\nOne. The left inlane lights dogleg and the Right inlane lights Cheat Shot.\nSlingshots: Normal.\nFlippers: Two normal Gottlieb \"Catch All\" flippers in the usual place.\nTargets: Three targets whose name escapes me at the moment. No known\nuse unless lit during Skins Game.\nSpecial Lane: A lane running behind the targets fed directly from the\ntop flippers. Awards a special when lit.\nHook Shot: A single stand up target which awards the hook shot value\nwhen lit. Can also be lit for a jackpot.\nVolcano: A vertical up kicker with a plastic volcano above it. Spots\nHoles 1, 6 and 9, starts modes when lit and can award a jackpot or a cheat\nshot when lit.\nMean Hole: A saucer in an enclosed area to the right of the volcano.\nAwards Mystery when lit.\nHurry Up 20 Million: A small standup target which awards 20M when lit.\nTop Flipper: A small flipper angled to shoot the volcano, hurry up target\nor a ramp leading to the mean hole. Balls can be caught by a small post\nif required.\nCoconut Targets: Four drop targets in front of a lane in the center\nof the playfield. Hitting them adds 1M to the end of ball bonus.\nCenter Lane: A lane leading to a vertical up kicker. The shot can be\nmade through a gap between the coconut targets but it's a fairly precise\nshot. Shooting the lane with all targets up awards a hole in one. If any\ntargets are down shooting the lane spins the Gopher wheel.\nCaptive Ball: A ball trapped in the top right corner. Hitting the ball\ncauses it to bounce around in it's little area hitting a bumper and some\nswitches. Each hit adds to the end of ball bonus.\nRight Ramp: A ramp leading around the back of the captive ball and feeding\nto the top flipper. Spots holes 2, 4 and 8 and relights the mode start\nat the volcano. Can be lit for jackpot.\nRight Orbit: Feeds around to the mean hole. Awards a dogleg , mystery\nor hole in one when lit.\nSlice Target: A single stand up target. Each hit adds a letter to Slice.\nSpelling slice lights a hurry up 50M. Can also be lit for an extra ball.\nSaucer: A typical Gottlieb saucer. Spots holes 3, 5 and 7 and can award\na jackpot.\nGopher Wheel: A roulette wheel sunk into the lower playfield. The wheel\nhas 12 holes representing the letters in the word Gopher. Lighting all\nletters starts Go-Fore-Par-Tee.\nRules:\nThe main object of the game is to play all 9 holes. Each hole must be\nhit in numerical order. After all holes are lit the 9th hole\nstarts an award depending on how many times the 9 holes have been completed.\nThe awards are:\n\n1st 9 Holes---Multiball\n2nd 9 holes---Raining Cats and Dogs\n3rd 9 holes---Multiball\n4th 9 holes---Anything Goes\nAfter anything goes, the sequence starts over again.\n\nMultiball\nMultiball can be either 2 or 3 balls. A second ball is served to the\nplunger and if it is successfully launched into the mean hole a third ball\nis given, otherwise multiball is a two ball affair. The object is to collect\nall the strobing jackpots. The jackpot is worth around 5M and hitting the\ncaptive ball increases this value. When only one jackpot is left hitting\nit awards a super jackpot of 300M. Collecting the super jackpot relights\nall the jackpots and the sequence repeats until only one ball remains in\nplay.\nRaining Cats & Dogs\nRaining cats & dogs is a 3 ball multiball, which is also known as\nthe Lightning Storm. All jackpot shots and the center lane are strobing\nand each hit awards 25M to the lightning storm total. The total is awarded\nat the end of the ball so tilting is not a good idea.\nAnything Goes\nAnything goes is lit at the mean hole. Shooting the mean hole starts\nthe mode. Anything goes is simply a lightning storm with each shot scoring\n50M. Normal lightning storm rules apply.\nGo-Fore-Par-Tee\nStarted by spelling gopher on the roulette wheel. This is another 3\nball multiball in which shooting either the center lane or the volcano\nawards an immediate 20M points, no questions asked.\nModes\nThere are 5 modes, which are started by shooting the volcano when lit.\nFor the first time through the modes, shooting the volcano lights it for\nstart mode. On all subsequent times the ramp lights start mode.\nSkins Game: Shoot the volcano to add a letter to skins. Spelling skins\ngive the choice of taking 10M points and being called a chicken by the\nmachine, or playing for double or nothing. The game chooses a shot at random\nand you need to hit that shot within 20 seconds to double your score. If\nyou miss you lose your score and start again from zero. For the rest of\nthat ball recover score is lit at the dogleg. Shooting recover score restores\nyour points to their former glory.\nFind the Gopher: 15 seconds to shoot any hole. If you are lucky you\nfind the gopher for 30M, otherwise you get insulted.\nExtra Ball: Extra ball is lit at the slice target for 15 seconds.\nTee'd Off: Shoot the center lane for an increasing point value starting\nat 5M.\nPitch and Putt: Each shot to the mean hole scores 10M. The post in the\nlane leading to the top flipper traps the ball to allow a clean shot at\nthe hole. The mode ends in 15 seconds.\nCompleting all 5 modes lights the big score target. No more modes can\nbe started on that ball.\nHole in One\nHoles in one is awarded by either a successful skill shot, a shot up\nthe middle lane with all targets up or a shot to the mean hole when lit.\n7 holes in one awards an extra ball and 9 lights the mean hole for Quickpick.\nQuickpick is simply a choice of either light special or start lightning\nstorm.\nStrategy\nThe main strategy for this game is to start any multiball except the\nnormal one, trap 2 balls on the right flipper, and continually loop the\ncenter lane for big points. With the catch all flippers it is dead easy\nto catch any ball coming from the volcano and the center lane, so with\npractice big scores should come easily. This is really a one shot game.\nBragging\nI can't remember what my highest score is on a 3 ball game, as I haven't\nseen one for a while.\nHighest score on a 5 ball game: 11B. Lightning Storm Maxed out at 6.375B.\nIf you have anything to add send it to me via chrisb@enternet.com.au\nand I will add it to the next version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Tee'd Off", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb Premier", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/teedoff.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Tee'd Off", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrules by Phaedrus\ngame by Data East\n\n\nThis is another one of my patented Fact-Free(TM) Rule Sheets,\nconstructed from memory, using Brent Earl's sheet as a memory-jogger.\nPlease send corrections to phaedrus@halcyon.com, or just embarrass me\nin r.g.p. :)\n\nOBJECT:\nScore points.  What did you expect?\n\nPLAYFIELD LAYOUT\n\n     Ramps   Two of 'em, the entrances of both of which are right next\nto each other, at the back-left-center of the machine.  (Sort of like\nthe ramps on Twilight Zones, but without any target in between them.)\nThe left ramp leads back to the right flipper; the right back to the\nleft.  Either ramp can be shot from either flipper, but shooting the\nleft ramp from the left flipper is a difficult backhand on most machines.\n\n     Turtle Targets   Four banks of three touch targets each, with each\none representing one of the four turtles.  Two on the left side of the\nplayfield, one in the middle, and one on the right.\n\n     Splinter   A captive ball at the far top left of the machine.\n\n     Bumpers   Three of them, at the top center of the machine, just\nabove one of the banks of touch targets.\n\n     April Lane   A spinner lane running up the right hand side of the\nmachine, to a touch target (April) just above the bumpers.\n\n     Sewer   A sinkhole shot, with an entrance just to the right of the\nbumper area and to the left of the April lane.  Balls shot in here kick\nout through a pop-up \"manhole\" near the center of the playfield.\n\n     Pizza   A Whirlwind-like spinning disk in the lower center of the\nplayfield.\n\n\nPLUNGER/SKILL SHOT\nThis game has a curious combination of manual and automatic plunger.\nThe ball is kicked into the plunger lane, and a manual plunger lets you\nplunge it into play.  But during multiball, or if your manual plunge\nfalls back into the plunger lane, then an automatic kicker kicks the\nball back up into play.  The plunger lane feeds down one of the ramp\nreturns to the right flipper.\n\nWhen you plunge a ball into play, the left ramp is lit for 250K*ball\nin play.  If you successfully shoot it before hitting another playfield\ntarget, the right ramp is lit for the same amount.\n\nSPOTTING TURTLES\nAt the start of the game, one target in each of the four turtle banks\nis flashing; the flashing target in each bank changes regularly.  Shooting\nthe flashing target gives you credit for that turtle (lighting the whole\nbank).  Shooting one of the other two targets instead solidly lights that\ntarget and turns off the flashing target; you must now hit the two targets\nyou didn't hit, lighting them as well, to get credit for the turtle.  On\nmost machines, collecting three turtles lights the Sewer for multiball;\nafter the first multiball, all four turtles must be collected to light the\nSewer again for subsequent multiballs.\n\nSPLINTER\nThe Splinter captive ball lane has five rollover sensors in it; the\nhigher up the lane you knock the ball, the more points you score.  Knocking\nthe ball all the way to the top of the lane scores a Splinter value.  The\nSplinter value to be scored is randomly determined, but one of six lights\non the backglass always indicates the next value to be scored; so at least\nyou know what you're shooting at.\n\nSplinter values include:\n\n\n     Mystery Score   Pretty self-explanatory.\n\n     Instant 3-Ball   Starts multiball.\n\n     Looping   Lights the left ramp.  Shooting the lit ramp awards 250K(?),\nand the ramp stays lit for 7 second; each subsequent hit increases the loop\nvalue by 25K(?).  A single \"Loop Record\" is kept of the greatest number of\nramp hits in this mode.\n\n     Ramp Millions   Spots all remaining letters in TURTLES, and starts the\nTURTLES Millions mode (see below).\n\n     Bonus X   Raises the bonus multiplier to some random value between 2x\nand 8x.\n\n     Extra Ball Lit   At the Sewer.\n\n\nCollecting a Splinter value does not \"mark it off the list\"; you can\ncollect the same Splinter value multiple times.\n\nIn addition, going through the right inlane momentarily lights\nSplinter.\n\nShooting Splinter while lit awards an increasing value displayed just above\nthe flippers, sort of like Freeway loops in High Speed.  My memory of these\nvalues is very foggy, but I believe they're something along the lines of\n25K, 50K, 75K, 100K, 150K+GInsu Scoring (all switches worth 50K for 20\nseconds), 200K+Super Ginsu Scoring (all switches worth 100K for 20\nseconds).\n\nSAVING APRIL\nIf a ball goes through the left inlane, the April lane is lit for a\nfew seconds.  Shooting the ball up this lane, and hitting the April target\nat the end, scores some fairly large value (150K?).\n\nTHE SEWER\nShooting a ball into the Sewer sinkhole when it is not lit for\nsomething else awards a random value:\n\n\n     Mystery Score, Bonus X   Same as on Splinter.\n\n     Spot Turtle   One of the turtle target banks is completed.  (This will\nnot start multiball, even if you now have enough banks to light multiball;\nmultiball will now be lit, but you must shoot the Sewer again to start it.)\n\n     Special Lit   The spinner in the April lane is lit for a special.\n\n     Bonus Held   Self-explanatory.\n\n\nTURTLES MILLIONS\nEvery time you hit one of the two ramps during regular play (when the\nramp isn't lit for anything else), a letter in TURTLES on the backglass is\nlit up.  These letters carry over from player to player and from game to\ngame.  Hitting a ramp when all seven letters are already lit starts the\nMillions round.  Both ramps are lit for 1M; you must hit one within 10\nseconds to collect.  If you collect one, the other remains lit for 1M, and\nthe timer resets to 10 seconds.  If you collect that one as well, the Sewer\nbecomes lit for 10M (a big chunk of points on this machine) for 10\nseconds.\n\nSo the ideal is to hit the left ramp first, since this sets up an easy\nright ramp shot, which in turn feeds to the right flipper for the Sewer shot.\n\nMULTIBALL\nCollecting enough turtles lights the Sewer shot for multiball.\nHitting this shot, or getting Instant 3-Ball from Splinter, launches all 3 balls\ninto play.  Your object at this point is to shoot the Sewer hole, before you\nlose two of the three balls.  If you do, an animation of the original turtles\nmutating into the TMNT is displayed, one ball is launched back into play if\nyou've lost one (putting you back to 3 balls), and both ramps are lit for\njackpot.  The jackpots each start at 1M, and the value slowly increases\nover time.  Hitting a ramp collects that ramp's jackpot; the other jackpot\nremains available, and its value continues to increase.  I don't remember what\nhappens after you collect both jackpots on the same multiball.\n\nIf you blow multiball badly, the Sewer is lit for a brief period to\nrestart it.\n\nLAST CHANCE\nOn Ball 3, the outlanes are lit for Last Chance, ala Black Knight.\nLosing a ball out a lit outlane autoplunges one back into play.  You only\nget one Last Chance, and this doesn't work during multiball.\n\nVICTORY LAP\nWhen you reach the replay score, the right ramp is lit for Victory Lap\nfor 20 seconds.  Shooting it in that time gives 3M points.  (\"Gimme\nthree!\")\n\nYou can only score this once.\n\nTURBO GINSU\nIn a multi-player game, the highest-scoring player gets a timed bonus\nperiod at the end of the game, again ala Black Knight.  For 30 seconds,\nballs are plunged into play as fast as they drain.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "possible_shots": "Ramps, Turtle Targets, Splinter, Bumpers, April Lane, Sewer, Pizza", "manufacturer": "Data East", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/teenagemutantninjaturtles.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

All rights reserved.\n\nNOTE: These rules are compiled from hours on end of continuous\nplay of \"Terminator 2\" and are as accurate as possible to the\nauthor's best knowledge.  If there are any discrepancies, please\nnotify the author.\n\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\nThis game does not have one single objective, it revolves\naround many different objectives.  Any one objective can be\nsingled out and concentrated on to get a good score.  Scores over\n200 million require using more than one, possibly all objectives.\n\nSTARTING THE GAME\nOne to four players can play.  New players can enter the game\nby inserting coins and pressing Start until the end of the first\nball; after that, pressing Start aborts the current game for all\nplayers and begins a new one.\n\nTRIGGER SKILL SHOT \n(formerly plunger skill shot)\n\nThe plunger has been replaced with a heavy duty gun grip.\nYou must pull the trigger at the right time to hit the moving\ntarget on the 5 bank.  Successful hit scores 1 million points.\nEach successful hit after that is worth 1 million more than the\nlast hit. (on a 3 ball game w/7 extra balls won, the 10th\ntrigger shot would net you 10 million)\n\nRAMPS\nCyberdyne Systems Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Cyberdyne\nSystems Skynet Command Center are hereafter referred to as Left\nand Right ramps respectively.\n\nAUTO-FIRE\nAt the start of a ball or when multi-ball is started auto-\nfire will light for a short time (operator adjustable).  When lit\nauto-fire is a feature that automatically saves a player's\ndrained balls by throwing them back onto the playfield. This is\nto prevent 5 second ball times from occurring.  It is especially\nimportant during multi-ball when balls will be lost in just a\nfew seconds typically.\n\nThe operator has the option of also lighting auto-fire when the\ndrop target is knocked down to prevent center drains when\nshooting at this key shot.\n\nRAMP SHOTS AND PAYBACK TIME\nShooting ramp shots with red arrows lit advances \"Security\nlevels\" lights (yellow circles).  Originally both lights are lit\nbut after either ramp has been made the first time, you must then\nalternate ramps to light more security circles.  Consecutive ramp\nshooting will award you with a MILLION for each consecutive shot.\nWhen all ten Security circles are completed you advance into a high\nscoring \"PAYBACK TIME\" mode for 20 seconds. (operator adjustable\ntime) During payback time there are 6 shots worth 5 million.\nTheses 6 shots can be made repeatedly and there is no required\norder that you have to hit them in.\n\n\n Up the left escape route and into the cup at the top.\n Up the left ramp shot.\n Up the right ramp shot.\n Up and around the chase loop on the right side.\n Hit the drop target under the endoskeleton.\n Complete the 3 green times lights above the bumpers.\n\n\nMULTI-BALL\nShoot and knock down the drop target, then shoot the ball\ninto the ball popper, the ball popper will fire the ball to load\nthe cannon.  When the cannon is loaded with a ball, the cannon\nswings out from its \"Home\" position.  Fire Cannon by pulling\ntrigger on gun grip when the cannon passes the lit white stand\nup target.  Hitting lit target scores Multi-ball.\n\nWhen Multi-ball is scored (by hitting lit target with an\naccurate cannon shot), two balls are shot out onto the playfield\nautomatically.  For a short duration \"Autofire\" will be on.\n\nJACKPOT and SUPER JACKPOT\nDuring Multi-Ball, the object of the game is to achieve\nJackpot and SUPER Jackpot, (50,000 points).  The player must\nload the cannon by shooting a ball into the ball popper hole,\nbehind the drop target. At this point the player is guaranteed\nan opportunity to shoot for a 1X Jackpot with the moving cannon,\nbut the cannon will NOT be loaded until the other balls are\ndrained or locked in the lock holes.  If the player can manage\nto get another ball into one of the remaining two lock holes he\nwill be guaranteed a 2X Jackpot shot.  If all three balls are\nlocked the cannon will load for a 3X Jackpot shot.  Maximum\npoints for Jackpot 1X, 2X, and 3X is 10, 20, and 30 million\nrespectively.\n\nRegardless of the number of balls locked, the player must\nhave 1 ball in the ball popper to qualify for a Jackpot.  When\nthe other 2 balls are either locked or drained, the game says\n\"Get the Jackpot\" the ball popper then loads the cannon and the\ncannon swings out to shoot at the targets.  If the player shoots\na lit target, then the player receives a 1X, 2X, or 3X Jackpot\ndepending on the number of locked balls as explained above.\n\nIf the player hits a 2X or 3X Jackpot, he may then shoot\nfor the SUPER Jackpot.  While at least 2 balls are in play, the\nplayer must reload the cannon with one of the balls in play.\nThe game then says \"Get the Super Jackpot\" and the ball is\npopped to load the cannon.  During the firing of the cannon for\nSUPER Jackpot the lit target is no longer a stationary target.\nIt is moving up and down while the cannon is also in motion.\nIt's a very tough shot but well worth mastering for the 50\nmillion points received for a direct hit.  If you managed to\nkeep the other ball(s) in play you may repeat this last step\nfor multiple SUPER Jackpots. Truly one of the best Super\nJackpot sequences to date, my hat is off to the people\nresponsible for this master of confusion.\n\nCHASE LOOP FEATURE\nThe game starts with the chase loop score value lights (red\nrectangles on the right side of the playfield) at the lowest\nvalue (250,000 points) flashing.  When the player shoots the\nball around the chase loop once, he receives 250,000 points,\nthe next rectangle in the line begins flashing (500,000 points)\nand the chase loop million light is flashing.  If the player\nmakes another consecutive chase loop shot re receives 1 MILLION\nconsecutive bonus points in addition to the 500,000 points lit.\nIf the player should make another chase loop shot immediately\nafter the second, he scores 2 MILLION consecutive bonus points\nand 750,000 points lit.  The player can continue consecutively\nin this fashion to light the 5 MILLION value.  Once the 5\nMILLION light is lit, it remains lit and continues to award 5\nMILLION points for chase loop shots for the remainder of that\nball.  With each new ball the chase loop value resets to the\noriginal starting value of 250,000 points.\n\nWith the glass off I tested the limits of this millions plus\nfeature of consecutively scoring the chase loop.. it did not seem\nto have a limit as my 101st shot netted a whopping 101 MILLION\npoints.  However I doubt anyone would be able to hit this shot\nmore than 20 times in a row no matter how good they are.\n\nESCAPE ROUTE FEATURE\nThe escape route feature consists of a row of six rectangular\ninserts on the left lower side of the playfield, the kickout\nhole at the top right of the playfield, and the red 3 bank of\nstand up targets in the middle of the playfield.  Each time\nthe player completes the red 3 bank targets, the rectangle\nfeatures advance in an upward direction and are lit in a\nflashing mode.  The player shoots the ball in the top kickout\nhole to collect the bottom-most flashing feature.  It is\npossible to have all or some of the rectangles flashing, but\nthe player must shoot for the top kickout hole to collect the\nvalues in an upward consecutive fashion\n\nThe player has the entire game to light and collect these\nfeatures because the game recalls the let features from ball to\nball.  At the 4th escape route feature (extra ball), the 3 bank\nof stand up targets go to a liberal timer mode, forcing the\nplayer to complete the 3-bank before the time runs out, and all\ntarget arrows go out.  When the top value, or \"10 million\" is\ncollected, the feature starts over at the \"security pass\" level\nwith a much more aggressive timer.  Lights in order they are\ncollected are:\n\n\n Security Pass - lights 1 security level.\n Hold Bonus - holds over bonus and Multiplier.\n Light Flipper Lanes - lights flipper return lanes to\nqualify Hurry-up (on left) and Video Mode (on right).\n Multi-Ball - begin standard multi-ball.\n Extra Ball - Scores and extra ball.\n 10 MILLION - 10 million when lit.\n\n\nDATABASE FEATURE\nDatabase is a random feature that contains a possible 16\nvalues that a player may collect \"randomly\" [computer overrides\nnot withstanding].  When the Database is lit, the player shoots\nthe ball into the lower left kickout hole; the game pauses\nbriefly for a display of \"Terminator thought\" and selects on of\nthe 8 displayed values.  The possible values are:\n\n\n1) Extra Ball  9) 500,000 \n2) Light Extra Ball  10) Video Mode \n3) Light Hurry-up  11) Chase Loop Advance \n4) Auto-fire  12) Security Level \n5) Special  13) Bonus X \n6) Light Kickback  14) Light Special \n7) 3,000,000  15) 1,000,000 \n8) Multi-ball  16) Hurry-up \n\n\nMy main gripe here is that the game really messes with you if\nyour score is getting to high... anything over 80 million and\nyer damn lucky if you get anything other than number 9 or 11.\nAnd not even listed you can get the real ripper of 100,000\n\"big points\".   The computer is also told to help the weaker\nplayer out so it wont be such a romp and discourage the guy\nfrom playing again. Extra ball is the most common help to a\nplayer not doing good against a better person.  If you're going\nto have a random element in a game KEEP IT RANDOM!\n\nBONUS MULTIPLIER\nA bonus is scored and stored in \"Terminator 2's memory\".\nThe longer a ball is in play the more bonus points he receives.\nEach time the three lanes at the top are completed, the bonus X\nis advanced from 2x to 8X.  Somewhere depending on the scores\nbeing placed on the machines as a whole, the game will light up\nthe \"skill extra ball\" for completing 6X or 8X.  The drop target\nscores this extra ball.  When \"Hold Bonus\" is lit, all Bonus and\nBonus Multipliers are carried over to the next ball.  If Hold\nBonus is achieved on the 3rd ball, Bonus is added twice.\n\nHURRY-UP (can you tell this is a Ritchie game yet?)\nHurry-up is a big-points feature that consists of a \"points\ntime down\" starting at a value of 15 million points and ends at\n3 million for the last 3 seconds of the 15 second count down.\nThe sooner the player collects Hurry-Up (by shooting around the\nchase loop when lit), the more points he collects.  The feature\ncan be lit by scoring the 3rd level of the \"escape route\", or lit\nrandomly by the database feature.\n\nVIDEO MODE \n(give it a chance before condemning video in a pinball!)\n\nSince Terminator 2 incorporates a Dot Matrix Display with\ngood resolution, a playable though short \"Video Game\" is offered\nto the player.  It consists of Terminators which must be scored\n(killed) by moving a cross hair target sight on the display.  The\ncross hair can be moved left and right with the left and right\nflipper buttons.  The video game is over when the terminators\nshoot the players 3 times or all the terminators are eliminated\nby the player.  If they are all eliminated you get a bonus.\nSpecial items in the video game:\n\n\n Endoskeleton Head - worth bonus points\n Flying terminator plane from the future - worth bonus pts.\n Extra Ball box - hit this fast falling item for an extra\nball.   Note: it doesn't always show up and mostly when\nit does you are not close enough to take it out, but it is\nreally nice when you do score it!\n\n\nMECHANICAL FAILURES\nThere is only a couple of problems with balls getting stuck.\nThe major problem is during multi-ball when you have a ball in\nthe popper and the drop target is hit and is supposed to reset\nfast enough to not allow another ball into the popper area. Quite\noften the ball will make it past the target in the split second it\ntakes to reset and you're stuck with 2 balls behind the target. This\nreally isn't a major problem as the game will shortly find that\nnothing is going and load the cannon for you.  The major drawback\nis that if this happens during payback time your timer will expire\nbefore it realizes that you are in this situation.  So either don't\ntake that final shot to start payback time during a multiball or\nbe very accurate with your multiball and keep them away from the\ndrop target.\n\nSETTINGS\n\nReplay start:  15 mil to 250 mil (factory 30 million) \nReplay Boost:  1 mil to 50 mil or OFF (factory 5 mil) \nReplay Percent:  5% to 50% (factory 10%) \nMatch Feature:  1% to 50% or OFF (factory 8%) \nSpecial Percent:  1% to 10% or OFF (factory 3%) \nExtra ball percent:  1% to 35% or OFF (factory 10%) \nMillions Plus:  ON or OFF (factory ON) \nDrop Target Autofire:  ON or OFF (factory OFF)  very nice when on  \nFlipper Trigger:  ON or OFF (factory OFF)  make'em use the grip!  \nChampion H.S.T.D.:  ON or OFF (factory ON)  LEAVE IT ON YOU FOOL!  \nTimed plunger:  ON or OFF (factory OFF)  On kicks ball out of plunger lane if players doesn't within 1 1/2 mins.  \n\n\nNOTE that was just SOME of the settings I thought would be\ngood reading.\n\nSUMMARY\nThis game is sure to be a hit of the year!  The only real\ndrawback on this masterpiece is that it didn't have a worldwide\nrelease date to coincide with the movie release. (pre-production\nmodels were out, but on the whole the game didn't start on the\nassembly line until mid august).  Steve Ritchie AND TEAM deserve\nlots of credit for giving us a simple playfield with the best\nset of rules to go with it!  Operators will be glad to have an\neasy to clean game and players will love the rules that make\nthis game so good.  First impressions of this game were low, but\nonce I got behind the flippers the game really sucks you in. The\nmovie tie in was nice but this game stands up to the if you\nwashed all the graphics off it rule it would still be a great\nfun to play. (was that a Yeager rule of thumb?)  Anyway hope\neveryone gets a chance to play a well-maintained version of this\nand as always if anything in this file is wrong, speak up and\nI will make the corrections.  This reflects a game set up on\nFACTORY settings but high scores DO make the game play harder.\n\nScore that took the game home in a tournament: 172 million\n\nMy current high score on factory:             508 million\n\nI have played about 10 games in the over 300 million range, and\nthe key is jackpots 1x 2x 3x Super and PAYBACK TIME! Don't\nforget to cash in on the extra balls that can be obtained in\nfour count them (4) different ways.  Good luck!\n\nHasta la veesta BABY!\n\nWritten by:  Dean St.Antoine\nP.O.

Calculation of scores and awards of more modern games is difficult because there are many stacking strategies and multipliers but I hope to have captured the main points of the game.  \n\nStern's T3 marked the return of Steve Ritchie to Pinball design after a 7 year break. The game has much in common with his earlier, highly successful Terminator 2, which was built by Williams in the early 90s. T3 is an all action movie and the pinball is also action packed. It also has a unique back-box gun game called the RPG, which stands for Rocket Propelled Grenade.\n\nDesign by: Steve Ritchie\nArt by: Kevin O'Connor\nDots/Animation by: Mark Galvez, Kurt Andersen\nMechanics by: John Rotharmel, Ray Tanzer, Steve Ritchie\nMusic by: Chris Granner, Steve Ritchie\nSound by: Chris Granner\nSoftware by: Dwight Sullivan\n\nGeneral Appearance\n\nT3 has a dominant robust metal appearance. The cabinet has a gun metal grey plate finish, it has the gun handle attached to the front of the cabinet. The playfield and back box are dominated by the colour red. The playfield also has a metal plate finish, the metallic terminator models and all metal ramps. \n\nPlayfield Description\n\nThe playfield is standard width a 2-flipper fan layout. \n\nThe lower playing area is pretty standard and looks very much like one of Steve Ritchie's previous game The Getaway, High Speed 2. It has two flippers and the usual in-lanes and out-lanes and a bank of 3 stand-up targets left and right just above the respective out-lanes. The left target bank is the Kick Back targets and the RPG targets are on the right. Hitting each target scores 10K and hitting all three lights the relevant feature.\n\nJust above and between the flippers are the usual \"shoot again\" lamp and 5 additional clear indicator lamps labelled Payback Time, Assault, Super Jackpot, Max Escape and RPG. These all need to be lit to start the 6th, the Final Battle.\n\nThe auto ball launch is activated at the start of each ball using a gun on the front of the cabinet. By timing the ball launch you can pick from a number of useful awards (see rules). It also fires the RPG back box toy and \"kills terminators\" when fired as instructed during Quick fire.\n\nThe upper playfield is interesting as the entrances to the shots are pretty much in a line about halfway down the playfield. Two of the ramps turn sharply and feed the ball at speed back to the flippers. The shots are all pretty tight so this is a game of accuracy and speed. \n\nMoving from left to right:\n\nCommand Centre is a partial loop around the back of the playfield and awards: Spot Weapon, Security Level, Hurry up (5m), Video Mode, Extra Ball, Assault and final Battle. Command Centre awards once lit carry over to the next ball if not collected.\n\nA thin Stand-up target that lights the RPG when lit is between the command Centre and the entrance to the Left Ramp.\n\nLeft .A. Ramp loops back to the left flipper and is one of two ramps used to advance security levels up to level 5 (also see combo.s)\n\nThe Jackpot/ball lock is a long lane just left of centre. This is a tricky shot because balls that don.t make the lock the ball heads back straight down the middle. There is a drop target in the lane that must be downed before locking the ball that can catch out unwary players.\n\nAt the back of the playfield is a nice shiny chrome model of the TX Terminator (the TX is a terminator terminator according to the movie). Its left arm is part of a wire form and fed from a VUK. This shoots the ball down the middle towards the right flipper and is used in TX Challenge mode and others.\n\nA Captive Ball lane is just to the right of centre and 3 hits spell R E D for Red mode.\n\nRight of centre is the middle .B. ramp that loops back to the right flipper. It is one of the tightest shots on the playfield and awards Bullet Hole, EB, Mystery, Hurry-up, Weapons and Special \n\nThe right .C. Ramp is next and also leads back to the right flipper\n\nThe .Escape. Loop travels up the right and around the back of the playfield although it has a diverter that means it only becomes a full loop at certain times during the game. Balls can be diverted to the rollovers and bumpers, right ramp or TX VUK, depending on your progress during the game. This shot is also used to start the RPG and Mystery awards when lit. \n\nThe top right area of the playfield contains, 3 rollovers, which in turn feed 3 bumpers. There is also a battle damaged Arnold terminator head complete with flashing red eye.\n\nThe RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade): It is a large back box toy and not on the playfield. A gun on the left moves up and down and fires a ball at a series of targets on the right and is fired using the gun handle to the right of the coin door. It is well integrated into play and comes to life ant various times during the game.\n\nPlaying the Game (Rules):\n\nNote: This game seeks to encourage new players and shows where to shoot at the start of each ball.\n\nSkill shot: by timing your ball launch you get to choose between your awards. Odd ball launches give choices of: Mystery (see mystery awards), Bonus Multiplier (4x-6x) and TX Challenge. Even ball launches add options of a ball lock and play RPG, to the awards you didn.t choose on the previous ball.\n\nBall saver: On factory settings at the start of the game this is very short although it does kick in occasionally as part of various modes later in the game. It is worth noting that selecting the Multiplier option at the start of the game is the only selection that gives you a reasonable ball saver on factory settings.\n\nTX Challenge: A shot around the back of the playfield can begin TX challenge. A ball is then shot out of the TX.s arm and the game counts down from 5 with scores reducing by 500,000 each second. That means you can get a possible 2.5M max for any shot made + a bonus challenge if you hit the TX.\n\nRollovers: The rollovers are unusual in that all 7, the in lanes, out lanes and top rollovers are connected and circulate via the flipper buttons. They are an important part of the game because they are used to light the Command Centre awards. Note: more are needed to light them 2nd time around.\n\nCommand Centre Awards: In order these are a Weapon, +1 Security Level, Hurry Up, Video Mode, Extra Ball and Assault. \n\nVideo Mode: This is similar to the classic video mode on T2. You move crosshairs using the flipper buttons and fire at robots, fliers and weapons using the gun grip. Scores for completion depend on the enemies shot. Scores of 6m+ are possible.\n\nHurry ups: These can occur at either orbit lane during the game and are worth 5m\n\nMystery: is lit at the right orbit (not sure how). Awards include Red Bullet Holes, Command Centre, Big Points, Video Mode, MB, EB, Lock a ball, Bonus Multiplier, RPG, and Escape. There are some very good awards that are worth collecting though and you also advance Escape wards during the process.\n\nAssault: All balls are launched into play with a long ball save. Most balls are delivered to the right flipper and your objective to hit the TX lane 3 times. You then need to hit a ball up either side of the playfield as indicated. That 4th ball is then kept locked for a few seconds, along with any other locked balls and the game offers you a RPG shot, the RPG moves up and down and you shoot at a lit target. During this process any balls still on the playfield remain in play. All of this is then repeated without additional ball saves until only 1 ball is left in play (also see Weapons).  \n\nWeapons: are available at the middle ramp and though awards such as command centre and mystery. Collecting 5 increases the Assault value.\n\nPayback Time: In T2 tradition this lights the ramps and loops for 1m for a set time of 30 seconds. \n\nRed: Red is earned by registering a hit on the captive ball 3 times. This is very distinctive as the playfield lamps shine red. All shots are worth 1m??. Once RED has begun you can.t start other modes or advance towards Payback Time but it is possible to start red on top of other modes.\n\nEscape Awards: Start at 100,000 and increase up to 1m. If the ball drains any progress on the Escape awards ladder is lost and you must start all over again. Also see Final Battle.\n\nMultiball: is started by locking 3 balls in the TX lane. The first time round this consists of two shots per ball, one to knock down the drop target blocking the lane and the other to lock the ball. After the first time the drop target resets if the ball isn.t locked within a few seconds. \n\nMultiball starts with some nice sounds and animation of a Terminator stamping on skulls and some menacing terminator action. Balls are then shot into play; one from the TX weapon, while others are auto plunged into play. Your objective is to hit the TX lane 3 times for jackpots and then again for super jackpot. There is a very short ball save but balls can drain quickly from this shot but it is an important objective as without it you can.t start the Final Battle.\n\nQuick fire & Combo awards: The gun, to the right of the coin door has several uses in the game. It fires balls into play, picks objectives at the start of each ball, fires the RPG and can be used when Quick fire is indicated to shoot Terminators in the display. Quick fire scores 1m points and is triggered by 4 consecutive indicated ramp shots e.g. ramps A, B, C, A. The ramp awards also increase during a sequence of up to 3 consecutive ramp shots.\n\nRPG: This can provide good points during a game. You get bigger points for both speed and accuracy. Awards count down from 10m and flawless performance gets you a bonus of 3 or 4m. The first time all the targets are lit and you get a bonus for hitting them in order. A 5m bonus is available if you complete the 5 targets in 3 shots. In subsequent activations you need to hit a moving target 3 as quickly as in as few shots as possible. You need to complete RPG 3 times to qualify for Final Battle.  \n\nStacking multiballs: Multiball, Red, Assault and payback can be stacked in various ways. It is useful to know that isn.t possible to pick up Command Centre awards during multiball so you can.t pick up useful things like extra ball or start Assault and if Red is started first certain other modes can.t be started. Some stacked combinations start a special mode called Blitz.\n\nBlitz: Is a wild mode that starts during certain combinations of 3 other modes. The one I know is MB, Red and Payback time but there may be others. The display show an image of closing steel shutters close is followed by the word BLITZ and shots are lit for higher scores, although it is difficult to put figures on it due to the stacking. This is accompanied by great dot matrix images and a robotic voice shouting out .SCREAM, TERROR, APOCYLIPSE. etc. It is very loud and exciting.\n\nFinal Battle: To start you must have completed Payback Time, Assault, Super Jackpot in MB, Max Escape and 3x RPG.s, as indicated by the lights at the bottom of the playfield. The Final Battle lamp is then at the left loop. Once started this has several stages.\n\nIt begins with multiball and the TX taunting you with comments such as .is that the best you can do?. You then hit the TX lane until you silence her.  The ramps and loops become lit and you need to complete these shots. During this process the game has a long ball save where it maintains at least a 2 ball multiball but if you don.t make all the shots in a set time you get a vocal count down from 5 and then they relight. Assuming you complete, the game pays tribute to some of designer Steve Ritchie.s video game work and you receive the Mortal Combat quote .Finish Her.. You then shoot the TX lane until she/it is dies. \n\nCompleting Final Battle and despatching the TX starts what is essentially the wizard mode. I won.t go into too much detail but almost everything is lit and you get a decent ball save. A skilled player with a good Final Battle can add 100m or more to their score. \n\nGame Tactics:\n\nThere are different approaches to this game. You can hit the ball around the flowing ramps, try and stack high scoring features or aim to complete the elements necessary for the Final Battle. \n\nIn T3 Final Battle is a realistic objective but you need to play tactically to get all the qualifying elements. In that case it is very easy to fail because you missed out on something such as getting Super Jackpot in MB or an Escape award. My advice is grabbing these when you can.\n\nIf you.re playing in a free flowing way the game opens up in a most rewarding way, with opportunities such as MB, Red and Blitz. It is always worth bearing Blitz in mind and remember that when stacking start RED last!\n\nIf you.re playing it competitively it is best to minimize the risk of drains SDTM and avoid the centre TX lane and captive ball until you get some points on the board. It is safer to start with Security Levels and Payback Time and to pick up mystery, RPG and Command Centre awards when lit. \n\nT3 doesn.t let you settle, many of the features intense and timed and ball saves soon expire. Passing the ball from flipper to flipper is tricky so it is much better to use the ramps to pass the ball. On most games that I have played it is safer to shoot the TX drop target from the left flipper.\n\nBEWARE, THIS GAME PUNISHES LOOSE PLAY! \n\nSummary\n\nT3 has great software and sounds and a fine rule set. In comparison to T2, T3 is both deeper and more challenging. \n\nIt is a schizophrenic game that can be cruel if you miss with fast drains and virtually no ball saves. Once in the game it is littered with highlights, such as RED, Assault, Blitz, Final Battle and nice touches, such as the video intro to multiball, the lighting effects and the gun games. You will be back!\n\nEddie Mole 2011-09-01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines", "possible_shots": "Command Centre, Left Ramp, Jackpot/ball lock, TX Terminator, Captive Ball lane, Middle Ramp, Right Ramp, Escape Loop", "manufacturer": "Stern", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/terminator3.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

If you have\nplayed Theatre of Magic, you can safely skip this section, and not miss much.\n\n\nLeft Inlane/Outlane  standard;\nSometimes a magnet above the inlane automatically can keep\nthe ball out of the outlane. The magnet works by a proximity sensor\nwhich senses magnetical objects.\n\nHocus Pocus Targets  Two standups a short distance above the left inlane.\n\nLeft Lane  Roughly in the same position as World Cup's Travel Lane.  Normally,\nballs through the lane pass around the back, past the top rollovers, and\nup a short ramp onto a habitrail back to the right flipper, so that the\nshot can be repeated [the setup is similar to Getaway's lock ramp].\nWeaker shots that don't make the ramp fall to the Bonus X Rollovers.\nAlso, a post diverter [like Tommy] can stop the ball on its way to the\nbumpers, pushing it into the Vanish Lock.\n\nVanish Lock  About 2/3 of the way around the Left Lane, the Vanish Lock can\nhold one ball.  The ball locks on a shot through the Left Lane, and the\nkickout pushes the ball out the Left Lane entrance.  The lock releases at\nthe start of any multiball, or at the end of the game.\n\nTiger Saw Captive Ball  Just to the right of the Left Lane, the Captive Ball\nis actually two.  A first ball is stuck [nailed?] to the playfield, and\nmost of the ball can be hit [unlike traditional captive balls].  Hitting\nthe first ball propels a second, moving ball, and pushing that ball to the\ntop of a short lane scores the shot.\n\nLeft Inner Loop  This short loop goes around the back of the Trunk, and out the\nRight Inner Loop entrance [through the spinner].  A post diverter behind\nthe Trunk can push the ball into the Rear Trunk Entrance, or a weak shot\nup the Left Loop may fall into it.\n\nMagic Trunk  The biggest \"gimmick\" on the game is left of center, about halfway\nup the playfield.  It rotates to four faces, and has a Hall-effect sensor\nin front [like Road Show's bulldozer] to judge hits.\n\n\n Face 1: nothing special, just a trunk.\n Face 2: like Face 1, with a hole in the center large enough for a shot.\n Face 3: like Face 1, with a green light near the top.\n Face 4: A bulls-eye target, with a magnet in the center that takes the\nball off the playfield when activated.\n\n\nAll four faces are used often; later rules describe when.\n\nRear Trunk Entrance  behind the Trunk, this opening leads to the Trapdoor\nKickout.  The Rear Trunk Entrance also serves as the lock for Theatre\nMultiball.\n\nCenter Staircase Ramp  halfway up the playfield, this ramp feeds the Left\nInlane.\n\nTrap Door Targets  Two targets to the left and right of the Center Ramp.\n\nRight Inner Loop  This loop goes directly through the Spinner, past the Rear\nTrunk Entrance, and out the Left Inner loop entrance.  Like the Left Inner\nLoop, the ball can be diverted to the Rear Trunk Entrance, or may fall\ninto it.  Beware that a full Loop shot may send the ball straight down\nthe middle, and plan accordingly.\n\nSpinner  within the Right Inner Loop.\n\nRight Staircase Ramp  This longer ramp travels around the back of the machine,\nall the way to the Right Inlane.  A shot that doesn't make it up the ramp\nfalls behind the Spinner and comes out the Right Inner Loop entrance.\n\nSpirit Ring  associated with the Right Ramp, the Spirit Ring pulls the ball off\nthe Right Ramp habitrail, holds it briefly, then drops it on the Center\nRamp habitrail [to the Left Inlane].  The Ring itself is on the left side,\nabove the Tiger Saw Captive Ball.\n\nTrap Door  a Slot Machine-like hole comes out from under the playfield at\ncertain times, blocking the Right Ramp.  This also serves as the kickout\nfrom the Magic Trunk.\n\nRight Orbit  Normally, this orbit travels all the way around the back of the\nmachine, coming out the Left Lane entrance.  A diverter can stop the ball\nalong the orbit, keeping it above the Bonus X Rollovers.\n\nPoof Target  Single standup above the Right Inlane.\n\nRight Inlane/Outlane  Identical to Left Inlane/Outlane [reversed, obviously].\n\nBonus X Rollovers  Two rollovers at the top.  Lane-Change is active with either\nflipper.\n\nMirror  behind the Bonus X Rollovers, the Mirror allows you to see the rollover\narea without craning your neck.\n\nPop Bumpers  Three, in standard pattern, below Rollovers.  The only bumper exit\nis out the entrance to the Right Orbit.\n\nFlippers/Slingshots  Standard two at the bottom.  No upper flippers or non-\nstandard kickers or slingshots.\n\nManual Plunger  Woo hoo!  The plunger drops the ball on the diverter from the\nLeft Lane's ramp, leading to the Right Inlane.\n\n\n Basic Rules \n[using names and descriptions above, again left to right]\n\n\nLeft Inlane/Outlane  The outlane lights for Special by random award or by\nbeginning Grand Finale.  Nothing special on the inlane.\n\nHocus Pocus Targets  When either is hit, outlane magnets light for\n15 seconds (default).  No effect during any multiball.\n\nLeft Lane  Collects letter in THEATRE anytime in single-ball play.  Normally,\nthe diverters allow the ball onto the small ramp; if Vanish is lit, the\nball will divert to the Vanish Lock, and during Strait Jacket Illusion,\nthe ball will divert to the Bonus X Rollovers.  Also collects Extra Ball\nwhen lit.\n\nVanish Lock  The Lock releases at the start of any multiball.\n\nTiger Saw Captive Ball  Advances count to light Vanish Lock [starts at 3, then\n6, then 6 and so on]; if Vanish Lock or Tiger Saw Multiball is lit, does nothing.\nWhen the third Vanish Lock is lit the Extra Ball will also be lit.\nAlso a Skill Shot [see\nindividual section], the scoring shot in Tiger Saw Illusion, and the\nJackpot in Tiger Saw Multiball.  Unlit ball hit scores 2M.\n\nLeft Inner Loop  Lights for Theatre Multiball lock and Grand Finale.  Also one\nof the scoring shots in Safe Escape Illusion, and usually a scoring shot\nin Spirit Cards Illusion [if Lock or Grand Finale is not lit].\n\nMagic Trunk  Since there are so many rules involving the Trunk, they don't\nreally fit well in this section.  The few \"basic\" rules to give here are\nthe Trunk's activity when nothing major is going on: shoot the Trunk three\ntimes to light an Illusion [the Trunk rotates], then shoot the Trunk's\nhole to start the Illusion.  The Magic Trunk is a scoring shot in every\nIllusion, but is the only scoring shot in Hat Magic and Trunk Escape\nIllusions.  The Trunk is also a Skill Shot [see individual section].\n\nRear Trunk Entrance  scores a Lock whenever hit in single-ball play,\nregardless of whether the lock was lit or not.   [See Theatre Multiball\nsection.]  Lock scores 20 million.\n\nCenter Staircase Ramp  Lights to spell MAGIC for the first two multiballs.\nAlso can be lit to Raise Trap Door, and is the scoring shot in Levitate\nWoman Illusion.  Unlit ramp scores 500K.\n\nTrap Door Targets  Hit these targets four times to light Raise Trap Door at\nthe Center Ramp.  If the Trap Door shot is not collected, one or more\ntarget hits may be necessary to light Raise Trap Door again.  The number\nof target hits registered resets at the start of each ball.\n\nRight Inner Loop  Lights for Theatre Multiball lock.  Also one of the scoring\nshots in Safe Escape Illusion, and a scoring shot in Spirit Cards\nIllusion.\n\nSpinner  Scores 100K/spin.  Scoring shot in Spirit Cards Illusion; each spin is\nthen worth at least 500K.\n\nRight Staircase Ramp  Lights to spell MAGIC.  If Spirit Ring is not lit, the\nRight Ramp lights it until collected.  Also the scoring shot in\nMetamorphosis Illusion.\n\nSpirit Ring  If Spirit Ring is lit on the Right Ramp, the Ring activates,\npulling the ball off the Right Ramp habitrail and onto the Center Ramp\nhabitrail.  The first Spirit Ring shot scores 10M, then lights Spirit\nRing for 20M for a brief period.  If the 20M is collected, it is lit again\nfor 30M for a brief period.  If the 30M is collected, Spirit Ring is not\nlit again.  The Spirit Ring will also activate [but not necessarily score]\nduring Metamorphosis Illusion.\n\nTrap Door  Shooting lit Raise Trap Door on the Center Ramp raises the Trap Door\nfor a very brief period.  Entering the Trap Door scores 15M and earns a\ntrip to the Basement [see individual section] for a random award.  The\nTrap Door serves as kickout from the Trunk, and when all balls have been\nlocked; pay attention, as there is no ball saver.\n\nRight Orbit  advances Clock [see section] by one hour in single-ball play and during Tiger Saw Multiball.\nBegins Tiger Saw Multiball when lit.  Normal diverter action sends the\nball around out the Left Lane entrance; in Strait Jacket Illusion, the\nball diverts to the Bonus X Rollovers.\n\nPoof Target \nScores 100K, that's it. On prototype machines, hitting the Poof Target\nwould raise a drain shield between the flippers but this feature was\nremoved when the game went into production.\n\nRight Inlane/Outlane  Identical to Left Inlane/Outlane [reversed, obviously].\n\nBonus X Rollovers  completing both rollovers advances Bonus X, to a maximum of 8x.\nAfter that, completion will score 5M. The Bonus X value resets after each\nball.\n\nPop Bumpers  add 101,320 to THEATRE value, and advance the lit Illusion.  Also\nthe scoring method in Strait Jacket Illusion.\n\nFlippers/Slingshots  Flippers are controlled by buttons at side of cabinet.\nSlingshots act of their own accord, score some random number equal to\nepsilon times the replay level, and advance the lit Illusion.\n\nManual Plunger  plunge, then go for a Skill Shot.  Or not.  It's your life.\nIt's your choice.\n\n\n Skill Shot \nWhenever a ball is plunged, the player has an opportunity for a Skill\nShot.  If it is the first plunge of the ball, the Skill Shot will be located\nat the Trunk, for one of three awards.  Plunge when the award you want is on\nthe dot display.  The three awards are selected among four possibilities:\n\n\n  10 Million OR 20 Million\n  2x Bonus [Multiplier]\n  Advance Clock [2 hours]\n  Begin Illusion OR 2x Combo\n\n\nBegin Illusion is always a choice if Illusion is not already lit;\notherwise, 2x Combo is always a choice.  Both are never lit at the same time.\n\n2x Combo doubles all Combo scores for the ball [see individual section].\n\nIf Illusion is lit, you must make the Trunk's hole to get credit for the\nSkill Shot.\n\nIf it is not the first plunge of the ball, the Skill Shot will be located\nat the Captive Ball, and is always Advance Clock [1 hour].\n\nSkill Shots count toward End-of-Ball Bonus [see individual section].\n\"Amazing skill!\"\n\n Illusions \nThere are eight illusions, listed in a book in front of the flippers.  The\nlit Illusion is flashing; Illusions already complete are solidly lit.  The lit\nIllusion is advanced by the slingshots and bumpers.\n\nThere are three ways to begin an Illusion: by Skill Shot, by Basement\naward [see section], and by shooting the Trunk.  To begin the Illusion by\nshooting the Trunk, you must first light the Illusion by shooting the Trunk\nthree times [lights in front of the trunk indicate the number of shots made].\nThe Trunk then rotates to reveal a hole, and shooting the hole begins the\nIllusion.  If you manage to hit the Trunk a fourth time while it is still\nrotating into position, the game will give you the benefit of the doubt and\nstart the Illusion immediately.\n\nGenerally during Illusions, you are encouraged to complete the task at\nhand: \"You must concentrate.\"  \"You must hurry up!\"\n\nA list of the Illusions, and their scoring level:\n\n Illusion 1: Tiger Saw \nDuring this round, shoot the Captive Ball for 15 million, and animation of\na tiger... sawing.  The first hit shows the tiger sawing a woman in half,\nand the second shows the tiger pulling a Fiorello LaGuardia, sawing a\npinball machine in half.  Presumably it is a Popeye.  The two animations\nalternate for later hits.\n\n Illusion 2: Levitate Woman \nShoot the Center Ramp for an increasing award: 11 million, 12 million, no\nlimit.  Each shot shows an animation of a levitating woman, who winks at\nyou, and the female voice says \"Levitate!\"\n\n Illusion 3: Trunk Escape \nThe trunk has been thrown underwater!  As the pressure climbs, shoot the\nstandard side of the Trunk four times to break the chains.  Each shot is\n17 million; completing the round gives a good animation.  \"You must break\nfree!\"  \"The pressure is building!\"\n\n Illusion 4: Spirit Cards \nShoot the spinner to collect points, and watch the cards fly between\nhands.  The first spinner shots gives 800K/spin, then 1.1M/spin, 1.4M/spin\nand so on without limit.\nIf Lock or Grand Finale is lit on the Left\nInner Loop, you must shoot the Right Inner Loop to collect.\n\n Illusion 5: Safe Escape \nThe assistant is locked in a safe, held by a rope.  Shoot either Inner\nLoop to get part of the safe's combination [the combination is 11-04-69,\nprobably someone's birthday].  The first two shots score 20M\neach and the final third scores 30M. When the round is completed the\ndisplay says \"Total: 60M\" for some strange reason. Again, a very\ngood-looking animation is yours for completing the round. \"The rope is\nbreaking!\" \"She's in danger!\" \"You are amazing.\" [completion]\n\n Illusion 6: Metamorphosis \nThe assistant is holding up a cape.  \"I am only an illusion.\"  Shoot the\nRight Ramp to score; the Spirit Ring will activate, giving you a chance to\nloop the ramp.  The first shot is 12 million, then 16, then 20...  The\nfirst shot shows the assistant transforming into a dove.  The second shows\nher transform into a tiger.  The third... well...\n\n Illusion 7: Strait Jacket \nThe assistant is in a strait jacket, and spikes are closing in.  Shooting\nthe bumpers pushes her hand closer to the freeing buckle.  Either the Left\nLoop [if Vanish is not lit] or the Right Orbit will deposit the ball in\nthe bumpers.  6 million is scored for each bumper, 60 million [10 bumpers]\ncompletes the round.  \"I knew you could do it!\"\n\nThis round is also useful if you want to build up your Bonus X.\n\n Illusion 8: Hat Magic \nThe trunk remains on the side with the hole; shoot the hole for 15\nmillion and some magic.  With the first shot, a rabbit comes out of the\nhat; doves come out the second time; the third time, a telephone.  A\ntelephone?  [Try the Easter Egg section if you must...]  Later shots just\ngive the rabbit again.\n\nEach Illusion has around a 20-second time limit.  Timers freeze while the\nball is in the pop bumpers or underneath the playfield.\n\nIn addition to the points particular to each Illusion, extra points are\nawarded for Trunk hits during rounds which do not involve the Trunk [all but\nTrunk Escape and Hat Magic].  The Trunk scores an increasing amount for each\nhit: the first hit is 2 million, then 3 million, 4, etc.  The value resets each\nball, but carries between Illusions.  In low-scoring Illusions [such as Spirit\nCards] it may be more worthwhile to shoot for the Trunk.\n\nBeginning all eight Illusions awards one-fourth of the items necessary to\nlight the Grand Finale [see individual section].  Note that this award is given\nas soon as the eighth Illusion is begun, and not as soon as it ends.\n\nIllusions count toward End-of-Ball Bonus [see individual section].\n\"The next performance is about to begin!\"\n\n Vanish / Tiger Saw Multiball \nVanish lights at the Left Lane after a set number of hits on the Tiger Saw\nCaptive Ball [hits during any Illusion count as well].  The default is to start\nat three Captive Ball hits to light Vanish.  \"Make the ball vanish!\"\n\nVanish scores 40 million, then qualifies the Right Orbit to start Tiger\nSaw Multiball.  Upon making the Orbit, the second ball is kicked down the Left\nLane, and the Jackpot is the Tiger Saw Captive Ball.  The first shot to the\nCaptive Ball is 30 million, then 40 million, then 50 million up to a limit of 70M.  \"Tiger Saw\nJackpot!\"  You do not need to relight the Jackpot,\nand there is no ball saver on this multiball.\n\nUpon completion of Tiger Saw Multiball, the count of Captive Ball hits\nresets to zero, and the number of hits needed to light Vanish will be six instead of three.\n\nLighting the third Vanish will also lite Extra Ball.\n\nIf Theatre Multiball is started after Vanish has been collected, the ball\nwill be kicked out of the Vanish Lock for a four-ball multiball.  Upon\ncompletion of Theatre Multiball, the Left Lane will immediately be lit for\nVanish and another 40 million.\n\nTiger Saw Multiball does not count toward lighting Grand Finale.\n\nDuring multiball, other game functions are interrupted; you cannot advance\nTHEATRE, you cannot advance to Vanish Lock, you cannot advance Trunk Hits and\nyou cannot advance toward a Trap Door Award.  You can however\nadvance the Clock and build up your Bonus X.\n\n Theatre Multiball \nTo start Theatre Multiball, you must first qualify two locks.  Lock is lit\nby completing MAGIC on the ramps.  For the first two multiballs, either ramp\nwill spot a letter in MAGIC; for the third, only the Right Ramp will spot a\nletter.  Progress toward MAGIC is displayed in lights in the center of the\nplayfield.\n\nWhen MAGIC is complete, Lock becomes lit on either Inner Loop shot.  The\nfirst Lock is 20 million, and a new ball is served to the plunger or from the\nTrap Door Kickout [if three balls are already in the lock]; if the ball is\nserved to the plunger, an opportunity for a Skill Shot is given.  \"The first\nball is locked!\"  The second Lock is immediately lit at the Inner Loop.\n\nThere is another method for achieving the first Lock; shooting the Rear\nTrunk Entrance at any time will award a Secret Ball Lock, a great animation,\na free completion of MAGIC, and the first Lock.  \"Oh NOOoooo!!\"  After a Secret\nBall Lock, the second Lock is immediately lit at the Inner Loop.\nThe Secret Ball Lock is only valid for the\nfirst two multiballs. After that, a Rear Trunk Entrance will only\nscore 10M.\n\nThe second Lock is 20 million, and spins the Trunk to the side resembling\na bulls-eye target.  Hit the Trunk, and the ball is stuck to its side by a\nmagnet.  The trunk spins to drop the ball into the Rear Trunk Entrance, and\nmultiball begins.  Before the balls are kicked out, the Trunk spins to the\nside with the hole.\n\nAs balls are kicked out, a timer counts down immediately: 5... 4...\n\"Three\"... \"Two\"... \"One\".  Shooting the Trunk hole during the countdown scores\nan immediate 100 million points.  \"ONE hundred MILLION!\"  This counts as a\nTheatre Jackpot, and the trunk spins to the side; a green light flashes at the\ntop of the Trunk.\n\nNote: the countdown is aborted if any other major shot is hit in the\nmeantime.\n\nIf the 100 million shot is unsuccessful, Jackpot is lit at the Trunk, base\nvalue of 50 million [always].  Shoot the Trunk to collect the Theatre Jackpot.\n\"Theatre JACKPOT... jackpot... jackpot...\"  A nice echo effect on the Jackpot.\n\nSeveral shots will raise the Jackpot by 5 million.  They are: Left Lane,\nLeft Inner Loop, Right Inner Loop, Right Ramp, Right Orbit.  These\nshots raise the Jackpot value, whether the Theatre Jackpot is lit or not.\nThere is no apparent maximum to the Jackpot value; if there is one, it is at\nleast 115 million.\n\nAfter a Theatre Jackpot is collected, the Trunk spins to the side, and a\ngreen light flashes on the Trunk.  You must shoot the Trunk a number of times\nto relight the Theatre Jackpot; this number increases for each Jackpot you\nscore.  To relight the Jackpot the first time, only two Trunk hits are\nrequired; the second time, three; then four; then five.  I believe five is the\nmaximum.  When the required hits are complete, the Trunk spins back to reveal\nthe hole.\n\nA shot that falls into the Rear Trunk Entrance will also score the Jackpot\nwhen lit.  Nothing happens if the Jackpot isn't lit, though this would be a\nnice Easter Egg to include in future versions [if there are any].\n\nEntering Theatre Multiball qualifies one of the four items necessary to\nlight the Grand Finale [see individual section], but if Theatre Multiball is\nthe fourth item [unlikely], Grand Finale will not light until multiball is\nover.\n\nDuring multiball, other game functions are interrupted; you cannot advance\nTHEATRE, you cannot advance the Clock, you cannot advance to Vanish Lock, and\nyou cannot advance toward a Trap Door Award.  However,\nthe right Bonus X diverter is closed during multiball so a shot to the\nleft loop will always end up at the Bonus X lanes, helping you to\nadvance your Bonus multiplier.\n\nCollected letters in MAGIC count toward End-of-Ball Bonus [see individual\nsection]; this includes only letters collected from ramp shots, and not any\nletters added by a Secret Ball Lock.\n\n THEATRE Hurry-Up \nThe base value for the THEATRE Hurry-Up is 50 million; the value is\nadvanced with every bumper hit by about 100 thousand per bumper.  Piddly\npoints, basically.\n\nPick up a letter in THEATRE by shooting the Left Lane in single-ball play.\nThe letters in THEATRE are spelled out on the dot matrix after each shot, and\nare also in playfield lights in the front center.  When THEATRE is complete,\nthe THEATRE Hurry-Up is lit at the Trunk, which spins to the side with the\nhole.  You must shoot the hole within 10 seconds to collect, after which time\nthe Trunk spins back to whatever side it was on.  To collect the Hurry-Up, you\nmust shoot the Trunk hole before it spins away.  The Hurry-Up timer pauses\nwhile the ball is in the bumpers.\n\nWhether the Hurry-Up is collected or not, THEATRE resets.  If you collect\nthe Hurry-Up, the value resets to 50 million; otherwise it keeps its current\nvalue.\n\nYour spelled THEATRE letters are carried over ball-to-ball until you\ncollect the Hurry-Up. After that they will be reset at the end of each ball.\n\nSpelling THEATRE qualifies one of the four items necessary to light the\nGrand Finale [see individual section].  You do not need to collect the Hurry-\nUp.\n\nCollected THEATRE letters count toward End-of-Ball Bonus [see individual\nsection].\n\n Clock / Midnight Madness \nAdvancing the Clock can be done in three ways: by Skill Shot [either at\nthe Trunk (2 hours) or the Captive Ball (1 hour)], by Basement award [see section], or by shooting\nthe Right Orbit during single-ball play or Tiger Saw Multiball.  Note that the basement can award\nboth \"Adv. Clock\" [1 hour] and \"Midnight\" [immediate Midnight Madness].\n\nAdvancing the Clock yields a quote about the time, more frantic as the\nhours go by.  \"It's two o'clock.\"  \"ELEVEN O'CLOCK!\"\n\nAdvancing to 6:00 lights Extra Ball on the Left Lane for the first time\nthrough to Midnight; successive go-throughs score 40 million at 6:00.\n\nAdvancing to Midnight [12:00, of course] begins Midnight Madness\nimmediately.  All mattresses are 50% off... no, wait, that's not it.\n\nThe Trunk spins to reveal the bulls-eye target, and the Clock starts\nrewinding itself from 12:00.  Shots to the Trunk catch on the magnet, and score\ntwice the current hour on the Clock, or 10 million, whichever is larger.  Every\n5-7 seconds, a loud \"bong\" is heard, and the Clock goes back one hour.\n\nAn immediate shot to the Trunk after the ball drops from the magnet may\nnot catch on the Trunk's magnet, as it takes a few seconds to get ready for\nanother shot.  If this happens, there is no score compensation; you only get\ncredit for shots that activate the magnet.  Still, there is enough time for\ntwo shots per \"hour\" of time in Midnight Madness.\n\nGetting to Midnight qualifies one of the four items necessary to light the\nGrand Finale [see individual section].  You do not need to finish Midnight\nMadness; if this is the fourth item, Grand Finale will light immediately on the\nLeft Inner Loop.\n\nThe current Clock time counts toward End-of-Ball Bonus [see individual\nsection].  Unlike MAGIC and THEATRE letters, there is no carryover between\ncompletions.\n\n Trap Door / Basement Awards \nGetting a Basement award is done in three stages:\n\n\n Hit the Trap Door Targets four times to light Raise Trap Door on the\nCenter Ramp.\n Shoot the Center Ramp for Raise Trap Door; the Trap Door will block the\nRight Ramp entrance.\n Shoot the Trap Door for 15 million and a Basement Award.  The animation\nof walking down to the basement is very nice.\n\n\nThere are always 10 Basement Awards to choose from; the screen resembles\nCreature's Snackbar Menu and Road Show's Bunker Menu.  The selection is\napparently random, but surely has a lot to do with the game in progress and so\non.  The game rarely gives the same Basement Award twice in one game.\n\nThe selections:\n\n\n __ MILLIONS       SPELL MAGIC\n MIDNIGHT       PINBALL\n LITE EX. BALL TRUNK MAGIC\n ADV. CLOCK         LITE SPECIAL\n ILLUSION          BONUS X\n\n\nNotes on the selections...\n\n\n Random millions can be anywhere from 15M to 40M.\n\n Midnight advances the Clock to Midnight immediately; if 6:00 is passed,\nthe appropriate award [Light EB or 40M] is given automatically.\n\n Bonus X only awards if 8x is not the current multiplier.\n\n \"Pinball\" = Video Mode.  Shoot all six targets in 20 seconds for\nExtra Ball [usually] or 40 million.  [Also see Easter Eggs section.]\n\n Light Special at both Outlanes, lit continuously for the rest of the ball.\n\n Illusion starts the currently lit Illusion immediately; this -can- be\nawarded while an Illusion is already in progress, I believe.\n\n Trunk Magic spins the Trunk to reveal the hole; shoot it within about 5\nseconds for 40 million.\n\n\n Combo Shots \nA Combo is awarded for any two shots in a row, made from the following\nlist: Left Lane, Left Inner Loop, Center Ramp, Right Inner Loop, Right Ramp,\nRight Orbit.\n\nThe first Combo Shot is 2 million; successive [immediate] Combo Shots\nincrease by another 2 million.  So a 3-Way Combo would be 4 million, 4-Way is\n6 million, and so on.  There does not appear to be a limit to this behavior.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to make the \"2x Combo\" Skill Shot, it doubles\nevery Combo value for the ball.  2-Way Combos become 4M, then 8M, 12M, etc.\n\nSome of the Combo Shots are easily repeatable; the Left Lane and Center\nRamp are most obvious.  A decent way to build points is to continually loop the\nLeft Lane.\n\n3-Way and higher Combos also generate encouraging quotes from the game:\n\n\n 3-Way [4M]: \"Amazing!\"\n 4-Way [6M]: \"Marvelous!\"\n 5-Way [8M]: \"Magnificent!\"\n\n\nThere are definitely more.  Often, some other event [such as completing\nMAGIC or THEATRE] gets in the way of the Combo displays and quotes.\n\n The Grand Finale \nTo light the Grand Finale, you must complete four tasks.  Two are simple,\none is hard, and one is extremely difficult.  What you must do:\n\n\n \"Theatre\": Complete THEATRE [to light THEATRE Hurry-Up].  Collecting the\nHurry-Up is not necessary.\n \"Multiball\": Play Theatre Multiball.\n \"Midnight\": Get to Midnight on the Clock.\n \"Illusions\": Play all eight Illusions.\n\n\nCompleting THEATRE is a piece of cake.  Getting to multiball is pretty\neasy.  Getting to Midnight is difficult, but can be done when you put it at a\nhigh priority.  But those Illusions are hard to come by, and eight... feh.\n\nAnyway, completing all four tasks will light \"Start Finale\" at the Left\nInner Loop anytime during single-ball play.  Shoot\neither left or\nright inner orbit to start a single-ball round where every ramp and\nloop are worth 50M and will give you a letter in \"MAGIC THEATRE\". You\nhave 60 seconds to complete these twelve shots for a rewarding 500M.\nShooting the left loop will divert the ball to the Bonus X lanes, a\ngood way to build your bonus and spell \"MAGIC THEATRE\" at the same time.\n\nExtra Balls\nExtra ball can be lit or collected doing the following:\n\n Getting the \"LITE EX. BALL\" Basement award when shooting into the\nTrap Door.\n Shoot down all six targets in Digital Pinball, another Basement\naward, will give you an EB.\n Advance The Clock to six o\\xb4clock will lite EB at the left loop.\n Lite the third Vanish lock (15 captive ball hits in total) will\nlite EB.\n\n\nTournament Mode\nIf the Tournament Mode Setting is set to \"yes\" most of the game play\nwill remain the same, the only thing that differ is that the random\nBasement Awards are turned off. A shot into the Trap Door will only\naward 15M.\n\nHolding left or right flipper button when starting a game (see \"Easter\nEggs\" section) will have no effect in Tournament Mode.\n\n End-of-Ball Bonus \nLike Flintstones, end-of-ball bonus is a combination of many awards.\nHere is a listing of the awards [in order, I hope].\n\n\n Magicianship: points based on the number of Grand Finale tasks complete.\n\n none: \"Novice\", 2M.\n one: \"Apprentice\", 4M.\n two: \"Journey Man\", 6M.\n three: \"Master\", 8M\n four: \"Master\", 10M\n\n\n MAGIC letters: 1 million x number of letters collected in the game.  This\ncounts only those letters collected in ramp shots, not \"free letters\" from\nthe start of the game or a Secret Ball Lock.\n\n THEATRE letters: 500 thousand x number of letters collected in the game.\n\n Clock Bonus: 1 million x current time on the clock.  12 noon = 0 points.\n\n Illusions: 4 million x number of Illusions played in the game.\n\n Skill Shots: 1 million x number of Skill Shots [Trunk or Captive Ball]\nmade in the game.\n\n\nALL this is multiplied by the current Bonus Multiplier, for the total End-\nof-Ball Bonus.  Bonus can sure be a lot; I've had it over 300 million.\n\nIf any of the six categories of Bonus are not applicable [no Illusions,\nno Theatre letters, etc.], then that category will be skipped in the Bonus\ncount.  The only category always listed is Magicianship.\n\n Miscellaneous \n Ball Saver \nA short ball saver is active at the beginning of each ball.  \"Stay right\nwhere you are!\"  There is no ball saver on any multiball, or any other game\nsituation.\nThe only exception is the operator adjustable\n(on/off) Trunk Ball Save where every hit on the Trunk side during\nsingle-ball play activates a short ball saver. The ball saver on a\nbuyin is much longer than the standard ball saver time.\n\n Extra Ball Buy-In \nDefault buyin costs 1 credit, and nothing special happens on the bought\nball other than an extended ball saver.  Default maximum number of buyins is\nthree.\n\nThe buyin can also be set to 1/2 credit, and the number of buyins can be\nset anywhere from 0 [off] to 4, or Unlimited.\n\nA game with any buyin is disqualified for the \"Master Magician\" [Grand\nChampion] score, as well as the first high score table.  A second table is\nreserved for buyin scores only.\n\n Game Credits \nDesign: John Popadiuk Jr. [World Cup Soccer]\nSoftware: Jeff Johnson [Creature, Judge Dredd, Flintstones]\nSound: Dan Forden [Star Trek TNG, many others]\nVoice Credits: wish I knew\n\nApologies that the credits are short; please send further credits.\n\n High Scores \nThe best score I've seen is around 4.5 billion.  My personal best is just\nover 3 billion.  Send me your scores, and I'll post them here.\n\n Beta Behavior \nThings different about the earliest Theatre beta versions:\n\n\n The Tiger Saw [plastic saw in top left of machine] worked!\n The Poof Target raised an up post between the flippers [like Fire or Big\nGuns] for a short time.\n Instead of something else [see Easter Eggs], holding in the right flipper\nwhen starting a game started \"Cube Mania\", a 20-second round where hits\nto the Trunk scores around 10-15 million.\n\n\n Easter Eggs \nDon't read this section unless you absolutely want to...\n\nOkay, you've been warned.\n\n Activate Digital Pinball \nHold in the left flipper button when starting a game.  \"Congratulations!\"\nDisplay reads: Digital Pinball Selected.  The first Basement Award will be\nPinball, and you play for 40 million.\n\nA bug here, possibly -- all players in the game will play the Pinball\nVideo Mode, but only the first player will play for 40 million.  All other\nplayers play for Extra Ball.\n\n Activate MK3 Secrets \nHold in the right flipper when starting a game.  \"Congratulations!\"\nDisplay reads: MK3 Symbols Activated.  Spell THEATRE to Reveal Symbols.  It\ndidn't seem to do anything, though.\n\n DOHO \nCheck out the Secret Ball Lock.\n\n Cow \nCheck out the Metamorphosis round.\n\n A Special Guest \nPlay Hat Magic, and shoot the Trunk three times.  The third time will\nbring up a telephone.  The assistant puts it to her ear... \"MOVE YER CAR!\"\n\nThose are all the Easter Eggs I know of.  Please inform me of more.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Theatre of Magic", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/theatreofmagic.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Theatre of Magic", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Morris, Adam 'ation' Rhine\n\n\n* worked on World Cup Soccer\n\nComments\n\nActually something to rival WCS.  I didn't think that they could do\nit.  I would even go as far as to say that I think it's better than Shadow\n(and from me, that's high praise).  Very smooth, and very natural shots.\nIt's not a game that you have to practice specific shots for; shots are\nmore of a natural extension.  Great job guys.\n\nPLAYFIELD LAYOUT\n\nDESRCRIPTION\n\nBALL LAUNCH  A real plunger, just like in WCS, but without the coin\ntoss.  I'll explain the skill shot later on.\n\nFLIPPERS  Just two, in the normal positions.\n\nSLING SHOTS  Two triangles, relatively small and\nnon-obtrusive.\n\nRAMPS  Two, called 'staircases', in the center and on the right.  Neither\nis steep, but both are very long.  The center ramp drains to the left\nin-lane, the right to the right.  There is possibly the coolest diverter\nin history on the right ramp that is activated during the Metamorphosis\nmode.  It is a large magnetic ring (called the 'Spirit Ring') located on\nthe left that catches your ball, flashes a blue light, and then placed\nyour ball in the center ramp return track.  The right lane has a drop\nsimilar to the one in WC, wherein if the ball doesn't make the ramp all\nthe way around, it drops into this and back onto the\nplayfield.  On the one I play, both are angled well as to avoid SDTM drains.\nHowever, I have heard reports of others on which the center ramp is VERY VERY\nunkind, to the point of being a design flaw.  Both are used to start locks,\nand in modes.  More on that later.\n\nORBITS  The left orbit scores extra balls and various silly things (like\nthe vanish I'll talk about in a second) and also spells T-H-E-A-T-R-E.   A\nleft orbit shot will either lead to a right in-lane drop (because of a\nweak shot, during the Straightjacket mode, and during the THEATRE\nhurry-up), or go to the jets.  Either way it will score an orbit.  Right\norbit advances the clock and starts the Tiger Saw Multi-ball.\n\nORBITS PART DEUX  There is a mini-orbit the the middle of the playfield,\nsurrounding the trunk.  This is where balls are locked, modes are played,\nand the spinner rests (on the right entrance).  Kinda tight entrances, but\nrelatively easy to get the hang of (my apologies for the dangled\npreposition).\n\nTRUNK  There is a big rotating trunk in the middle of the playfield.  One\nside is flat with a green lite, one is flat with a blue lite, one has a\nsuper-cool magnet used in the clock mode and to start multiballs, and one\nhas a trap used for jackpots and in modes.  It starts modes, scores skill\nshots, is the jackpot, is a target in modes and locks balls.  Its a magic\ntrunk, and so much more.  More on it later.\n\nJETS  Three jets, in a triangle.  You can't see them from your vantage\npoint, so a mirror is provided.  Artwork is inverted for you even (X sunoB\necnavdA).  Very neat.\n\nBASEMENT   A really neat feature, wherein a 'trapdoor' pops up and stays\nopen for a few seconds, awaiting the entry of your ball.  It can be\naccessed by a center ramp shot when the 'Open Trapdoor' lite is lit.  See\nrules section.\n\nCAPTURED BALLS  There are two captured balls on the left, just to the right of\nthe far left orbit.  Every three hits lites Vanish.  It is also used in\nthe Tiger Saw mode, to advance the clock, and as the Skill Shot after a\nball has been locked or vanished.  Plus it makes super-neato sounds when\nhit.\n\nOUTLANES  Middle drain is very kind, seldom drops there, and the Anti-Biff\nBars do an exceptional job of bouncing the ball back into play.  The right\nand left lanes are normal, and relatively kind.  There is no kickback,\nhowever on both sides there are old-style, but automated magna-saves that\nmake a neat 'hiss' when accessed.  Very cool.  This has to be earned\nthough by hitting the 'Hocus Pocus' target above the left in/out lanes\n(about the same position as the Lite Kickback in WCS).\n\n\nJACKPOT SHOTS\n\nTHEATRE MULTIBALL  The trap in the one side of the\ntrunk.\n\nTIGER SAW MULTIBALL  The Captured Balls.\n\n\nRULES\n\nSKILL SHOT\nWhen you launch the ball, there is a hat on the screen that has various\ngoodies coming out of it.  Launch when it is on the one that tickles your\nparticular fancy.  Choices I've seen are:\n\n\n Various points\n 2x multiplier\n 2x combos\n Start illusion (mode)\n Advance Clock\n\n\nThere are only three choices per launch, and I believe the 2x combos appears\nonly if Illusion is already lit.  Once the choice is made, you activate it by\nhitting the trunk.  You may get two tries at it of you're fast.  Also, you\nonly get one Skill Shot per ball.  After a ball is locked or vanished, hit\nthe Captured Ball to Advance Clock.\n\nNote: the flippers will change which Illusion is lit before the ball is\nlaunched.\n\nMODES\nModes are started by hitting the trunk three times, then hitting the vault\ntrap, or by a skill shot.  A trunk shot during a mode gives you 2y points,\nwith y starting at 2M.\n\nThe various modes are:\n\n\nTIGER SAW  Timed mode with big tiger with a saw rolling around the screen\nsawing various things such as a pinball machine.  Three hits of the\ncaptured ball finishes the mode.\npoints =???????????\n\nLEVITATING WOMAN  you attempt to make a lady levitate.  Three shots\nof the center ramp completes the trick.\npoints =??????????\n\nESCAPE THE TRUNK  You, as a master magician attempt to escape from a\nsealed trunk.  You have to hit the trunk three times.  Pretty easy.\npoints =?????????\n\nSPIRIT CARDS  I'm not quite sure of the point to this one, you just flip\ncards around on the screen.  Spinner shots award points.\npoints=????????????\n\nESCAPE A SAFE  You, as a Master Magician, force yourself into a safe and\nbecome submersed in water.  Three shots through the middle orbit, either\nside, and you live to tell about it.  Great quotes during this mode.\npoints = 51M (17M x 3)\n\nMETAMORPHOSIS   Three right-ramp shots and you are a member of the animal\nkingdom.  Rumor mill has it that a cow has been spotted during this mode.\npoints=????????????\n\nSTRAIGHTJACKET  You attempt to escape a straitjacket this time. 16 jet\nhits completes the mode.  And as Scott says, completion yields a really\nneat animated sequence.  Very easy.\npoints=  48M (16 x 3M)\n\nHAT TRICK  You pull things out your hat, like a good magician.  First a\nrabbit, then doves and finally a phone which screams \"MOVE YER CAR!!!\".\nThree hits in the trunk trap ends the mode.\npoints= 15M per shot.\n\n\nTHINGS THAT ARE NOT ILLUSIONS, BUT MODE-ESQUE IN NATURE NONETHELESS\n\nCLOCK   If you get the clock to midnite (accomplished through skill shots,\nright orbit hits (one hour per orbit), Captured Ball hits, and Basement\nAwards) the trunk rotates until the magna-surface is facing you.  Hit it\nfor big big\npoints.  Starting at 24 million points, and decrementing for each hour\ndown to 0.  At 6:00 extra-ball will lite.  It will also light the\nextra-ball when you get the Midnight Basement Award.  My roommate's\ngirlfriend got a replay from this mode alone.\n\nBASEMENT   Four hits of the two white targets on either side of the center\nramp will light 'Open Trapdoor'.  Then hit the center ramp to, well, open\nthe trapdoor, located on the right side. below the right ramp.  When a\nball is captured in this manner, it goes down into the playfield, awards\n15M points and a random menu ala the Roadshow convenience store pops up.\nBalls are ejected from here during multiball, when a ball is shot into\nthe trunk, and when you are playing with more than one player and you lock\na ball after she/he has already done so.\n\nAwards are as follows:\n\n\n Digital Pinball (YEA!!)\n Extra Ball\n Advance Clock\n Midnight\n Light Special\n X Bonus\n ????????????\n\n\nDIGITAL PINBALL  Very very cool video pinball game available as a Basement\nAward.  There are five targets at the top, and two flippers at the\nbottom.  if you hit all five targets in 20 seconds, you get either 40 million\npoints or an  extra ball.  WOO HOO!  It even lets you catch the ball on\na raised flipper.  If the ball drains it just reappears above one\nof the flippers.\n\nVANISH   When the vanish indicator is lit (accomplished through three\nCaptive Ball hits), hitting the left orbit will vanish the ball.  The ball\ndisappears, a new one is ejected into the launch-lane, and you receive 40\nmillion points.  This will lite the Tiger Saw Multiball.\n\nTHEATRE   Shooting the left orbit spots a letter in T-H-E-A-T-R-E. Once\nthis is complete, a hurry-up is invoked.  For some some strange and\nwonderful reason the value doesn't count down.  You have 10 seconds to\nshoot the trunk (which has turned so the trap is facing you) to collect\nbig points (which is increased by bumper-hits during normal play).  If you\nlock a ball during this mode, you get credit for the trunk shot as well.\nPlays a hum-dinger of a tune during this mode.\n\nTHEATRE MULTIBALL  The lock is initiated by hitting either ramp while the\n'Lite Magic' indicator is lit (which is lit through ramp shots), or\nthrough the secret ball lock.  Secret ball lock is accomplished by the\nball not quite making the orbit.  All balls are ejected to the right\nflipper from the Basement (its a three ball multi-ball, however if you\nmake a ball Vanish, and do not collect the Tiger Saw Multiball, it will be\na four-ball.  You will then have to Vanish a ball afterwords to re-light\nTSMB.).  Jackpot is scored by hitting the trap in the Trunk wall (which is\nthe side now facing you).  While the balls are being ejected initially the\nlovely assistant will count 3-2-1 (rather quietly, you may not be able to\nhear her in a loud environment).  A jackpot shot during this will give you\n100 million points.  Three shots to the trunk re-lights jackpot.  Ends\nwhen less than two balls are in play.\n\nTIGER SAW MULTIBALL   After you have made a ball vanish, you can access\nthe Tiger-Saw Multiball (a two-ball) with a right orbit shot.  Bad news is\nthere's no ball save.  Good news is that Illusions continue during it.\nJackpot is the Captured Ball at about 15M a pop.\n\n\nEXTRA-BALLS\nExtra Balls are lit by:\n\n\n Reaching 6:00 on the clock\n Winning Digital Pinball\n Basement Award\n\n\nHitting the left orbit then awards it.\n\nCOMBOS\nCombos are scored by consecutive shots to just about anything (i.e.\norbits, ramps, etc.).  You do not have to alternate flippers or targets.\nYou can just sit there and hit the center ramp from the left flipper until\nyour face turns blue (memories of alpha quad in ST:TNG).  Two in a row\nstarts the scoring at 2M points, and increments 2M for every combo\nthereafter.  Maxes at about 12M.\n\nBONUS X\nBonus multiplier is via the lanes above the jets (flippers control which\nlane is lit).\n\nMAGICIAN RANKS\nYou work your way up through the ranks, aspiring to someday become 'Master\nMagician'.  You advance a rank for every time you complete a mode.  Ranks\nare:\n\n\n Novice\n Apprenticeship\n Journeyman\n Master\n\n\nYou receive 2M x rank as an end-of-ball bonus.\n\nHIGH SCORES\nSend me your best (no buy-ins, and only three-ball machines count).\n\nWIZARD AWARD\n\n\nGRAND FINALE  When all Illusions are complete, Theatre Multiball is finished,\nTheatre has been spelled and the Midnight is complete, the Grand Finale\nstarts.  I don't want to ruin the surprise =).\n\n\nEASTER EGGS\n\nHolding the left flipper while hitting the start button to start the game\nwill initiate the 'Digital Pinball Selected\" mode.  This will give you\nDigital Pinball as your first Basement Award.\n\nI have heard, but have not been able to get this to work, that holding\nthe right flipper while hitting start to start the game will initiate the\n'Mortal Kombat 3' mode.  This will supposedly give you clues during\nwhile spelling T-H-E-A-T-R-E to codes for MK3.  Perhaps it depends on the\nmachine's ROM version.\n\nQUOTES/SOUNDS\n\nThere are some great sounds, and some that are really rather familiar in\ntone.  For instance, after a ball save the lovely assistant will say\n\"Here is another ball\" which sounds EXACTLY like the ST:TNG ball save\ncomment of \"Here is another chance.\"  The jackpot comment is very similar\nto Raul Julia in TAF.\n\nSome of my favorites:\n\n\n \"Amaaaazing Skill\"\n \"Oh noooooooooo\"\n \"That ball is FULL of magic\" (after secret ball lock)\n \"You MUST concentrate\"\n \"The air pressure is building\"\n \"The magic is within you\"\n\n\nSomething that should have been put in: Doug Henning saying \"Illuuuuusion\".\n\nGRAPHICS/ARTWORK\n\nAs always with Bally games (well, with the exception of D*rty H*rry)\nplayfield, cabinet and backglass artwork is superb.  The obligatory Bally\nchesty\nbabe adorns the backglass, throwing pinballs at you in front of various\nmagician toys and a very mean looking tiger.  Also, if you look closely\nthe 'O' in 'Of' is actually a pinball.\n\nScreen graphics rival Shadow in quality.  Mode animations are very smooth\nand detailed.  By far the best animation is that of the lovely assistant\nbreaking loose of the straitjacket when said mode is completed.  Looks\nvaguely like Samus's death animation in Super Metrois (apologies for the\nv*d** g*am* simile).\n\nThe cabinet is a magic trunk, wrapped in a chain and lock, and is more\nthan a little impressive.  Looks as though it may have been rendered.\n\nVARIOUS OTHER EARTH-SHATTERING TIDBITS/COOL FEATURES\n\n\n 2 high score tables... 1 for buy-ins... 1 for 0 buy-ins.\n Message about standby for extra ball on DMD after ball drains if you\ncollected an extra ball.\n Mirror for lane change.\n If you hit the trap (door in trunk) before the trunk is fully turned\n(while it is turning for start illusion shot), you receive both start\nillusion and a hidden lock!!!\n\n\nBUGS\n\nThe lane lights above the jets are a pale green and very hard to see.\n\nA very clean inner-orbit shot will result in an SDTM drain that is hard to stop.\n\nWell thank you all for your time and continued support.  Look for updates\nas they become necessary.  Have fun kids.\n\nInsert witty .sig here\nCheck me out at http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~dolemite\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Theatre of Magic", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/theatreofmagic2.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Theatre of Magic", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "From Mark@antelope.demon.co.uk Mon Jul 14 22:42:13 1997\nThe Timeshock! Rulesheet, v2\n============================\n\nOne quick game,\n  Then just one more;\n    Then another,\n      More and more,\n        Outside the light\n          Fades into night:\n            Look at clock =\n              T!.\n\nPlease, everyone, send me updates like mad.  The email address (humanified\nto avoid spam-searches) is:\n\n       shocked [at] antelope [dot] demon [period] co [full-stop] uk\n\n  ** PLEASE DO NOT SEND UPDATES BY JUST REPLYING TO THIS MESSAGE.  THAT\n  ** WILL SEND THEM TO MY PERSONAL ADDRESS.\n\n- Updates have been slow because my Cd-Rom drive has finally rung down the\n- curtain and joined the choir invisible and my TimeShock! CD is hence\n- beyond reach.  This situation to be rectified as soon as possible.\n\nThe Plot\n~~~~~~~~\n  Somewhere, sometime, existed a scientist who was the proud owner of a\nTime Crystal.  While doing whatever futuristic scientists do with Time\nCrystals, they managed to break it.  This had the effect of creating a\nTimeshock! - a widening wave of anti-time, which threatens to destroy the\nuniverse if it completes its trip back from the future to the dawn of\ntime.\n  The scientist, realising the crisis, quickly hacked together a time\nmachine, and set out to find where in time and space the four parts of the\ntime crystal had gone.  Once they have all four parts, they will be able\nto return to the Dawn of Time, and smash the crystal a second time,\ncreating a second Timeshock! - which will cancel out the first.\n\nChanges from The Web\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  For those who played The Web, the following features leap at you:\n\n- The setup interface is a lot nicer.\n- There's an operator mode.  You can adjust gameplay parameters.  However,\n  a lot of the parameters are marked as \"Locked\" initially, so you can't\n  change them; presumably there is some way to unlock them (various\n  ways have been mentioned: scoring GC or the Wizard award does NOT do the\n  trick - play for X hours...?)\n- It runs in much higher resolution and colour depth.\n- The bonus count music is a lot more mellow.\n- The announcer is even more strange.  Whilst Web boasted the Evil French\n  Woman, the Blade Runner Lift Woman and the Muppet Animal Bloke, Timeshock!\n  has only one announcer - a female announcer who appears to have been\n  connected to an emotion randomizer.  (Supposedly she's the scientist who\n  broke the crystal.)  Quotes are listed when non-obvious.  The best quote so\n  far, though, is the tilt: \"Don't they have pinball in your time?\"\n\nThe Playfield\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUsual drill... left to right whistle-stop tour.  We'll get to the complex\nstuff in a moment.\n\nLeft Outlane:  Yes, there is one.  It contains the S light of SCAN.\n\nTime Machine:  Mounted to the left of the left outlane and above it.  It is\nthe ball tank which holds locked balls.  Balls are locked in it via an\narm mechanism which picks them up from a habitrail (which comes down from\nthe spinner).  Balls are ejected through a gate, over the left outlane and\ninto the left inlane.  Just like Indiana Jones, there is a post near to the\ngate, and some outlane drains can be saved by this post.  When a drain is\nsaved in this way, you score 5M.\n\nLeft Inlane:  Totally ordinary, except it has the C light of SCAN.\n\nW target:  The W in W-A-R-P, on the bridge between the left outlane/inlane\nand the orbit.\n\nLeft Orbit:  One end of the orbit which curves right around the back of\nthe machine.  Lights features in strict order.\n\nLeft Ramp:  Used to light the Time Machine.  Feeds back to the left inlane.\n\nM-A-G targets:  Face directly right on a bank just next to the left\nramp.  One half of M-A-G-N-E-T.\n\nLeft Side Ramp: Above the M-A-G targets and facing right, similar to the\nDemolition Time shot.\n\nSpinner Lane:  Just to the left of the Time Crystal, this lane feeds into\nthe Jet Bumpers, or may direct the ball to a habitrail to the Time Machine\nif lock is lit.\n\nA target:  The A in W-A-R-P, just to the left of the crystal.\n\nTime Crystal:  Slapbang in the middle top of the playfield, a big green\nrotating crystal.  Its entrance is guarded by two rubber posts, a little\nlike the skull shot on No Fear (except that you can see the enterance - but\nit makes it quite a tricky shot).  Does lots of wonderful things.\n\nR target:  The R in W-A-R-P, just to the right of crystal.\n\nLittle hole:  Just that.. a hole that lets the ball dribble out from the\njets.  Nothing special whatsoever.\n\nN-E-T targets:  On the right of the R, facing down and to the left.\nThe second bit of M-A-G-N-E-T.\n\nBumpers and lanes:  Two lanes with a set of jet bumpers above them.  The\ntwo lanes lite when rolled through and award bonus multiplier when both\nare lit.  Holding both flippers shuts off the jet bumpers if you want to\nget the ball out quickly in a time-limit mode.  (The time limits do\nactually pause while the ball is in the jets, but you may want to get it\nout quickly to avoid disrupting your shot rhythm.)\n\nRight ramp:   Also used to light the Time Machine.  Feeds the right inlane.\n\nRight orbit:  Used to collect and score the Quickshot feature.  Feeds right\nround to the left orbit.\n\nUpper-right flipper:  Usable to hit the M-A-G targets and the left\nupper ramp.\n\nP target: On the maximum right of the playfield, the P in W-A-R-P.\n\nRight inlane:  Has MagnoSave!!  Hit the MagnoSave key to activate a\nmagnet above the inlane and pull balls out of the outlane.  It must be\nrelit once it's used.  Also contains the A of S-C-A-N.\n\nRight outlane:  Guess there has to be one.  Doesn't do anything nice,\napart from containing the N of S-C-A-N.\n\nAttract Mode\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  During Attract, you can do the following funky things by hitting button\ncombinations:\n\nBOTH FLIPPERS AT ONCE: to put up your Score Validation Code for\nsubmission to Empire's web site.  Tap the right flipper to cycle through\nstatistics for your game.  Codes are only issued for games played with\nfactory settings.\n\nLAUNCH AND START TOGETHER: the operator's menu.  During a game, this\ncancels the game and returns to attract mode.\n\nHOLD LEFT FLIPPER FOR 2 SECONDS: to enable challenge mode.  Hit start to\nplay challenge mode, or the flipper again to cancel it.  (Challenge mode\nenabled multi-player sharing for all features.)\n\nHOLD RIGHT FLIPPER FOR 2 SECONDS: to enable tournament mode.  Hit start to\nplay tournament mode, or the flipper again to cancel it.  (Tournament mode\nequalises random features.)\n\nHOLD LAUNCH FOR 2 SECONDS: to toggle between your custom settings and the\nfactory settings.\n\nSkill Shot\n~~~~~~~~~~\n  First, select Novice or Regular mode.  Novice mode gives you 120 seconds\nof unlimited-ball play.  Regular mode is a 3-ball standard game.  I bet\nthere's a hidden Wizard mode or similar in there somewhere.\n  The plunger shoots up the Left Side ramp and round to the right inlane.\nEither the Left Orbit, Ramp, or Spinner will be lit.  Shoot for the\nskill shot, initially 5M; it rises by 1M, to a maximum of 10M, every time you\nmake it.\n  To enable the \"Secret Skill Shot\", hold both flippers while the ball\nis in the plunger lane.  In this mode, the plunger magically becomes a\nmanual plunger.  Plunge and try and hit the \"A\" target of M-A-G.  The award\nis 1/2 of the standard skill shot value, but you get a free completion of\nM-A-G-N-E-T (ie, awards and quickshots are advanced and magnosave is relit).\nThe Secret Skill Shot raises the skill shot value in the normal way.\n\nScanner\n~~~~~~~\n  Use the flippers to cycle lit S-C-A-N lanes between the inlanes and\noutlanes.  Spelling S-C-A-N lights the Scanner at the Crystal.  The scanner\nis a random award.  Known awards are:\n\n    Light Lock\n    Start Exploration\n    Video Mode\n    Find The Cow (?)\n    Small Points (random, 1M or less.  If you collect Small Points, hit both\n                  flippers to collect \"Very Small Points\" - 100 or less.)\n    Boost Multipliers (generally by 3x-6x)\n    Spot W-A-R-P target\n    Special\n    Advance Time Drive (by 20%)\n    Light MagnoSave\n    Advance Quickshot\n    30 second Ball Saver\n    Very big points (100M-200M)\n    Advance awards\n\n  The scanner starts the game lit.  A counter is increased each time you\nrelight the scanner: every 5 scanners, a Super Scanner is lit.  Super Scanner\nis similar to the Super Random features on lots of old Data East tables; two\nrandom options are chosen and you get to pick one of them.  However, the\noptions are different, and better:\n\n    Special\n    Super Jets\n    Light all locks\n    Light all awards\n    Light all quickshots\n    Super bonus boost (5x-10x)\n    Spot empty continents\n    Activate Time Machine\n    Ultra Jets\n    Ramp Rampage\n    60 second ball saver\n    Super Magnosave  (unlimited use until end of ball)\n    Light Video Mode\n    Light Time Warp\n    Midnight Madness (only available within +/- 15 minutes of 00:00 system time)\n\n  Two extra balls are also available, at 10 and 100 scanners.\n\nRamp Rampage\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  A 60 second timed mode.  Object is to shoot each ramp 5 times.  Each ramp\nshot made is worth 1M+1M to 9M.  There is also a value multiplier, which\nstarts at its maximum of 5 and decreases by 1 every 2-3 seconds, but never\nbelow 1.  Each ramp shot made increases the multiplier by 1, but never above\n5.  Shooting the upper ramp scores 1M*multiplier and boosts the multiplier to\n5 right away.  The 10th shot is worth a flat 100M.\n\nMidnight Madness\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  10 ball frenzy with a 120 second ball saver.  Every switch is worth 10\npoints (!).\n\nBonus Multiplier\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  The two lanes above the bumpers advance the bonus multiplier by 1x each\ntime.  An extra ball is lit at 25x.  (Yes, you read that right - 25x.)\n\nJets\n~~~~\n  The Jets pass through a series of stages of \"Super Jets\".  In each stage,\nit takes 100 hits to advance to the next stage.  The number of Jets is not\nheld between balls unless you have collected the \"Hold Jets\" award from\nthe Left Orbit.\n\nStage 0:  Super Jets unlit.  Hits just count down.  100 hits to next stage.\nStage 1:  Each Jet hit scores 1/3 of 1M.  100 hits to next stage.\nStage 2:  Each Jet hit scores 2/3 of 1M.  100 hits to next stage.\nStage 3:  Each Jet hit scores 1M.  Maxed out.\n\nOrbit Awards\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  M-A-G lights the next award on the left orbit: N-E-T lights the next award\non the right.  Spelling MAGNET completely lights MagnoSave (how'd you\nguess? ;) )\n  Shooting the Left Orbit collects the highest lit award.  The awards are:\nHold Multiplier, Hold Jets, Light Video Mode, 4-Ball TimeWarp, and Mystery.\nIf you hit the Left Orbit and no award is lit, you get a Paradox Award, a\nrandom points award in the style of Odd Change.  In Tournament Mode, this\nis always 99,990.\n  The Mystery award at the end of the sequence is always Light Extra Ball\non your first completion of the awards.  Second time, it can be a number of\nthings: if the award is collected in Multiball, you get Super Spinner.\nOtherwise, you get Reverse Frenzy.\n  Shooting the Right Orbit collects the highest lit award.  The only awards\non the Right Orbit are Quickshot awards: Quickshot 1x, Quickshot 2x... up to\nQuickshot 5x.  Quickshot counts down from 10M * quickshot multiplier; shoot\nthe Right Orbit to collect the countdown value, plus a Souvenir. \"Souvenirs\"\nchange with the timezone:\n\nPresent Day:  Pinball, Magnet, Mobile phone, Couch potato, Pint of Milk\nFuture:       Rocket board, Ray Gun, Battery, Red Knight 3000, Hologram\n                Projector\nRome:         Death Mask, Papyrus Scroll, Toga, Ankh, ?\nPrehistory:   T-Rex Tooth, First Wheel, Baby Pterodactyl, Dinosaur Egg,\n                Asteroid\n\n  If you make a quickshot, and the NEXT quickshot above it was lit, then\nthat other quickshot mode immediately starts as a \"Double Quickshot\".  This\nquickshot is different: it counts down from 20M*Multiplier to 2M*Multiplier.\n(Check: Is there a Triple Quickshot?)\n\nSouvenirs\n~~~~~~~~~\n  Souvenirs can be combined to enable special awards.  Two Souvenirs are\nrequired for each award.  When you have the two required souveniers,\nshooting a lit non-super scanner will display the two souveniers in\nquestion and give you the award.  Known so far:\n\n(Key to timezones:  (P)resent, (F)uture, (R)ome, (D)inosaurs=Prehistory)\n\nMobile Phone (P)    Couch Potato (P)             Very Big Points\nT-rex Tooth (D)     Baby Pterodactyl (D)         Ultra Bonus Boost (10-20x!)\nDeath Mask (R)      Ankh (R)                     Ultra Ball Saver (90 sec)\nPint of Milk (P)    Dinosaur Egg (D)             Find the Cow\nRocket Board (F)    Battery (F)                  Special\nRed Knight 3000 (F) Pinball (P)                  Extra Ball Quickshot\nToga (R)            Magnet (P)                   Ultra Magnosave\nPapyrus Scroll (R)  First Wheel (D)              Ultra Spinner\nAsteroid (F)        Hologram Projector (F)       Secret Video Mode\n\n  Ultra Magnosave:  Unlimited Magnosave use for the current ball AND THE\nNEXT.\n  Extra ball Quickshot:  15 second quickshot: right orbit for extra ball.\n  Ultra Spinner:  3M/spin for 60 seconds.\n  Find the Cow:  For the rest of the ball, one of the orbits or the spinner\nlane will \"find the cow\", and award 5M plus 5M per cow found so far.  The\ncow moves after each successful shot.  However, the shot is not lit - there\nis no indication which shot it should be.  (Check: Maxes out?)\n  Secret Video Mode:  See Video Mode.\n\nSuper Spinner\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  The spinner is worth 1M/spin for 60 seconds.  Each spinner lane shot\nadds 100K to the spinner value.  (Check: Does it max out?  Does the spinner\nincrease the timer?)\n\nReverse Frenzy\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  All major shots are 5M each.  Shoot them all to light Extra Ball.  After\nthis, they all relight: shooting them all again awards Very Big Points.\n  Easy?  Nope.  Throughout this mode your flippers are reversed and\nsemi-randomised.  Usually the right button flips the left flipper.  Usually.\nThere is a short ball saver after the end of this mode to prevent your ball\nbeing lost due to the flipper confusion.\n\nQuickshot Mania\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  If you complete all the Left Orbit awards and Quickshots, Quickshot\nMania becomes lit on the Right Orbit.  For 30 seconds, hitting any\nM-A-G-N-E-T target starts a Quickshot counting down on one of the orbits:\nM-A-G lights the Left Orbit, N-E-T lights the Right.  The start value of the\nQuickshot on the Orbit will be: # targets hit * # seconds left in Mania * 1M.\nShooting the appropriate Orbit will award the value.  You can continue to\nlight and collect either orbit regardless of the state of the other orbit.\n  Each target hit or orbit shot adds 5 seconds to the timer.  In addition,\nevery orbit shot will light a number of the award or quickshot lights on\nthat orbit: the number is equal to the number of targets down on that side.\nWhen all the lights are lit, either orbit completes Quickshot Mania and\nawards 100M.\n\nCombos\n~~~~~~\n  The right orbit doesn't award anything when it's not lit for a Quickshot,\nbut it does enable the right ramp and right orbit for a combo.  Shooting\nthe right orbit a second time advances the bonus multiplier.  The right\nramp starts the combo sequence, which is:\n\nRight Orbit -> as many bonus multipliers as you can get ->\nRight Ramp (combo)          ->\nSpinner lane (double combo) ->\nSide Ramp (triple combo PLUS Light All Continents) ->\nLeft Ramp (super combo PLUS Light All Locks *probably*) ->\nCrystal (ultra combo PLUS Instant collection of all souvenirs for current\n          time zone (!!).  Also, if you had the scanner lit, you'll get a\n          combination award right away.)\n\nThe Time Machine\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  Spinning the Spinner awards letter(s) in the \"Lock-O-Meter\" (the five\ntriangular lamps spelling \"L-I-T-E-Lock\" near the Spinner).  A couple of\nspins (4?) are needed for each letter.  Once all of them are lit, the Spinner\nlocks balls in the Time Machine.  Each lock awards 5M.  Lock three balls to\nstart Time Machine Frenzy.  For your second frenzy and later, you\nmust complete the Lock-O-Meter for every lock.\n  However, you might actually (gasp) want to use the Time Machine to\nTravel in Time.  To do that, you do exactly the same thing, but you must\nactivate the Time Machine first.  Shooting a ramp pumps power into\nthe time machine.  For the first Time Travel, each ramp puts in 20%; for\nremaining Time Travels, each ramp puts in 10%.  After shooting any\nramp to power up the Machine, you must use the OTHER ramp for the next\npower up.  At the start of each ball, both ramps become available again,\nunless one ramp has a lower power level than the other.  (Check: I'm\ndefinately missing something here, because I suspect the individual ramp\npower levels count more significantly than implied.  This section is due a\nrewrite.)\n  Each ramp also lights the other ramp as a timed shot to award a Ramp Way.\nRamp Ways count up, although you won't see the count-up unless you carry on\nshooting Ramp Ways when the time machine is at 100% (because the time machine\nanimation overrides the Ramp Way one).  You will, however, hear the announcer\ncall \"Two Way\", \"Three Way\", \"Four Way\"..  Ramp ways are worth 1M for each\nramp way made in the current sequence (ie, 2M, 3M, 4M.)  After 10 Ramp Ways,\nthe announcer says something different...  Spoiler 2.\n  If you have powered up the Time Machine, then when you lock three balls,\nyou'll be asked what period you want to travel to.  (Note: Powering up the\nTime Machine doesn't on its own light the locks - you still have to go\nthrough the spinner procedure.)  The periods available are:\n\n                                     Requirement\n   The Present Day                   None\n   The Distant Future                None\n   Ancient Rome                      1 Tachyonium\n   The Prehistoric Age               2 Tachyonium\n   The Dawn of Time                  3 Tachyonium + 4 Crystal Fragments\n   (unknown)                         8 Tachyonium + Dawn of Time completed\n\n  To go to Prehistory, Rome, or (unknown), you need to connect Tachyonium\nfrom Explorations.  The Dawn of Time is the Wizard award (Timeshock! Frenzy,\nSpoiler 3), and you must collect all four Crystal Fragments from Time Machine\nFrenzy to get there.  (unknown) is..  very special (Spoiler 4, but please\nresist).\n  Once you've selected a period, you have to shoot the Time Crystal to\nstart the Time Machine.  Lean back and watch the *AWESOME* pyrotechnics.\n(Have somebody standing by to catch your jaw first time.  Twentieth time,\nhit launch to skip it ;) )  Immediately after your Travel, Time Machine\nFrenzy starts with 4 balls rather than 3.\n  Your Time Zone determines the music played.  It also changes the\nExplorations you will have available.  Most importantly, however, you can\ncollect only one Crystal Fragment from each Time Zone.\n  If you light the Time Machine but you really don't want to change Zone,\nyou don't have to.  When you're asked where you want to go, select the\nZone you're already in.  3-ball Time Machine Frenzy will start just as\nif the Time Machine had never been lit.  The Time Machine will remain\nactive, so you'll have the option to travel again next time you start\nTime Machine Frenzy.\n  (Strategy note: It's a VERY bad idea to Time Travel on your first Time\nMachine Frenzy.  If you do, you'll have to go back for the Present Day\nCrystal Fragment later, and that means making four time trips instead of\nthree - and that extra time trip will be a 10-shot job..)\n\nTime Machine Frenzy\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  Three- or Four- ball play (sorry, must avoid saying m____b___) - four-ball\nif you took a trip through time immediately before starting it, three- if you\ndidn't.  Both ramps are lit for Jackpot.  Collecting a Jackpot lights the\nopposite ramp for Double Jackpot for a limited time; collecting a Double\nlights the opposite ramp for a Triple.  Collecting a Triple lights the\nopposite ramp for ANOTHER Triple, and you can go on all day if you like.\nIf one ramp is lit for a multiplied jackpot, shooting the unmultiplied\nJackpot on the *OTHER* ramp will reset the timer for the multiplied jackpot.\nJackpots start at 10M and increase 100K/spin and 1M/side ramp to no known\nlimit.\n  Each Jackpot also lites a Continent; Double lites 2, Triple lites *FOUR*\n(yes, four.. yes, I know it's strange).  When all seven Continents are lit,\nyou have found a Crystal Fragment. Shoot the Crystal to get the Fragment\n(50M).  You cannot collect ANY jackpots while the Crystal Fragment is\nlit!  Once you have the fragment, the Side Ramp lights for Super Jackpot,\nwhich is 5x Jackpot Value.\n  Once you have the Super Jackpot, any Triple Jackpot collected will light\nthe Side Ramp for Ultra Jackpot for 5 seconds (regardless of the Side Ramp\nbeing lit for any other Jackpot): if it times out, it reverts to Super\nJackpot again.  Ultra Jackpot is 100M + values of all previous jackpots that\nmultiball (!) to maximum 500M.  Scoring the Ultra unlights all continents\nand puts you back to the beginning: it also resets the value of the\nUltra.\n  After a frenzy in which you got a Crystal Fragment ends, shoot the\nCrystal to lock the Fragment into place.  The ball will be piped to one of\nthe miniature Fragments around the playfield - which one it goes to is\ndetermined by your Time Zone.  Locking a fragment is worth 50M.  Locking\nthe Fourth fragment lights Extra Ball.\n  There is no frenzy restart or similar, but if you have the Crystal\nFragment available when you drop out of frenzy, it will remain lit\nfor 15 seconds.  There is a brief grace period after the frenzy in which you\ncan still still collect one or two Jackpots.  However, if the Crystal\nFragment wasn't lit as your Frenzy ended, then even if it only takes one\nor two Jackpots to light it, you can't light the Fragment in the grace period.\nIf you get another Time Machine Frenzy in the same time zone, you start again\nfrom where you were, unless Ultra Jackpot was available, in which case you\nmust recollect a Super Jackpot to enable the Ultra Jackpot again.\n\nTime Warp\n~~~~~~~~~\n  Spell W-A-R-P (hit the letters in strict order) to light \"30 second Time\nWarp\" at the Crystal.  Spelling WARP again adds 15 seconds to the timer.\n  Time Warp is 2-ball play.  For the first X seconds (however many you earnt\nby spelling WARP), spelling W-A-R-P again or shooting the left side ramp adds\nanother ball (provided you have less than 4 in play), and any balls you drain\nwill be relaunched.\n  The Warp Jackpot starts at 10M, and goes up by 500K * balls-in-play every\ntime you hit a W-A-R-P target.  There is a Jackpot Multiplier, which initially\nis x1; spell W-A-R-P or hit the side ramp to increase the multiplier.  The\nCrystal collects the jackpot.\n  After one Jackpot, the Jackpot multiplier goes to x0 (ie, unlit).  Spell\nW-A-R-P to or hit the side ramp put the multiplier to x1 and relight the\nJackpot.\n  Time Warp, it seems, can be started almost any time.  It can be started\nduring an Exploration.  It can even be started during Time Machine Frenzy.\nHowever, you cannot lock balls for any frenzy during a Time Warp.  (However,\nyou can *light* one lock.)\n\nExploration\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n  Shoot the Upper Ramp in normal play.  This explores a Continent.  If you\nfind Tachyonium there, an Exploration starts.  If you don't, you just\ncount up a Continent.  The Jets rotate the lit Continent, so you can use the\ndouble-flipper trick to select a Continent if you want Tachyonium quickly.\nThe lit continent also rotates constantly while the ball is in the plunger\nlane, so you might be able to select a Continent by carefully timing your\nlaunch.\n  There are 7 continents and 2 will contain Tachyonium.  Which two is\ndetermined by your Time Zone.  Every five empty continents (even if all\nfive aren't in the same Time Zone) awards \"big points\", which starts at\n25M and rises by 25M every time it's collected.  Continents with Tachyonium\ndo not light, or count, unless you actually complete the mode; so you can try\nthe modes several times.\n  Exploring all the empty continents in one Time Zone doesn't do anything\n(except almost certainly get you a Big Points award).  However, if you\nexplore every continent in a Time Zone, and you have gotten all the\nTachyonium, something VERY special happens... see Spoiler 1.\n  If you shoot the Spinner -> Ramp combo, you explore *TWO* continents.  If\nboth are empty, you get nothing.  If one has Tachyonium, you get the 1\nContinent count-up for the empty one, and the Exploration for the other one\nstarts.  If BOTH have Tachyonium, only the first one starts.  If Lock is lit,\nand you want to try this combo, hold the right flipper down for a little\nwhile then tap the left.  The lock will unlight for roughly 2 seconds so you\ncan try the shot.\n  The backglass animation on the Explorations is *AWESOME*.\n  Starting any Exploration appears to award 1M (this may also be true for\nan empty Continent).\n\nPresent Day\n-----------\nChannel Tunnel (Europe):  60 seconds.  Shoot the Right Orbit to start\nmining.  All the time you're mining, your score and the mode percentage\nrises.  Shooting any ramp or the spinner speeds up the count-up.  When you\nreach 99%, you'll be told you have found the Tachyonium; you must\nnow shoot the Left Orbit to safely get the Time Machine out of the\nChunnel.\n  If you don't make the Right Orbit shot to start mining in the first 15\nseconds, the Machine starts mining automatically, but you will need to\nspeed up a large number of times to make up for the time deficit at the\nstart.\n  Since your score goes up constantly while you're mining, no precise\nscoring information can be given.  When you find the tachyonium, you will\nhave made 50M on the mode.  Getting the tachyonium is worth another 50M.\n\nMount Rushmore (North America):  [\"Get UP there..\"] The three Ramps are lit.\nClear off all three, then hit the Spinner for the final climb, 50M, and the\nTachyonium [\"THERE it is!\"].  If you run out of time, you fall off Mount\nRushmore.... owwwch.  The first three climbs are worth 5M, 15M, and 30M\nrespectively.\n\nAncient Rome\n------------\nChariot Race:  60 seconds.  You start in 4th place, and the aim is to move\nto 1st.  To move ahead a place, shoot the lit ramp or orbit.  At any given\ntime, the orbit and the ramp on one side of the playfield or the other will\nbe lit; however, the lit orbit and ramp switch sides every half-second or\nso!\n\nPyramid (Africa):  65 seconds.  Shoot the crystal to light all shots except\nthe upper ramp and crystal; shoot all five shots (2*ramp, 2*orbit, spinner)\nto win the mode.  As in the Channel Tunnel, if you haven't hit the crystal\nby 15 seconds into the mode, the game spots the Crystal and lights the shots\nanyway.\n\nDistant Future\n--------------\nPower Plant:  60 seconds.  Destroy the Power Plant by hitting the bumpers,\njust like you did with the Ammo Dump in The Web. ;)  Each bumper does 1%.\nAt the start of the mode, and whenever the ball leaves the bumpers, the\norbits will light to do 29% damage for 3 or 4 seconds.  At 98% damage, shoot\neither orbit for the Tachyonium.\n\nRobot War (South America):  60 seconds.  The M-A-G-N-E-T drops are lit.  Hit\nthem to attack the robot.  MAG targets are worth 10%, NET are worth 5%.\nCompleting either bank lights the upper ramp for a *lot* of damage (35-50%?)\nShooting any target in either bank will RAISE all targets in the OTHER bank\n(but it will not unlight the upper ramp).  If you hit certain other shots\n(the left orbit certainly, possibly the spinner..) the robot hits you, which\ndeducts 5%.\n\nPrehistory\n----------\nDinosaur Stampede:  60 seconds.  Similar to Chariot Race: hit the left\norbit, then the right orbit, then make two more orbit shots while the\nlit orbit alternates between the sides.  Fortunately, they only alternate\nevery second as opposed to every half-second.\n\nVolcano:  60 seconds.  Put three buckets of water on the volcano.  Spinner\nlane gathers water; any ramp dumps it.  You can hold up to 2 buckets of\nwater before dumping some.  When 3 buckets are on, shoot the crystal for\nthe Tachyonium.\n\nVideo mode\n~~~~~~~~~~\n  Pops up at the Crystal as the third Left Orbit award.  The game also\nsometimes seems to light it at odd times (scanner? 3rd ball sympathy?)\nShoot the Crystal for the video mode.\n  The aim of the mode is to fly the Time Machine down a cylinder, collecting\nClown faces (1M apiece) and avoiding mines.  The Time Machine can take\n5 hits from the mines before the Video Mode ends.  The twist is that the\ncylindical tube is affected by gravity.  If you want to get the awards near\nthe top of the tube, you need to build up your momentum by swinging back\nand forth in the bottom, or you won't be able to climb the sides of the\ntube.  But if you're swinging back and forth, you'll hit more mines.\n  The final face on each level is worth 10M * level.\n  If you get all the faces on a level, you get all your lives back and go to\nthe next level immediately.  However, if you win that level, your Video Mode\nwill end, and your next Video Mode will start on the following level - in\nother words, you can play a maximum of two levels per trip.  If you get all\nthe faces WITHOUT losing a life, the video mode total is doubled.\n  If you miss some of the points, you leave video mode, and you will start\nfrom the same level next time you score Video Mode.\n  SECRET Video Mode is a different beast altogther.  It always starts at\nlevel 1 regardless of your normal Video Mode level.  Cows are substituted for\nClown Faces.  You can play as many levels as you wish in one trip, but you\ndo NOT recover lives between levels.\n\nBonus\n~~~~~\nThe end of ball bonus:\n        (25k * Scanners\n       + 50k * Ramp Ways\n       + 100k * Continents\n       + 250k * Souvenirs)\n         * Multiplier\n\nSpoilers\n~~~~~~~~\nRules for things you'd perhaps prefer not to know about right away.\nTo read sensibly, delete every other character of each line, starting with\nthe second.  Eg:\n\nT|h|i|s| |i|s| |a|n| |e|x|a|m|p|l|e| |o|f| |h|o|w| |t|h|e| |s|p|o|i|l|e|r|s|\na|r|e| |w|r|i|t|t|e|n|.|\n\nOf course, on the actual spoilers, the intervening characters are letters and\nnumbers to make it hard to read the surrounding text.  Just load your\neditor, point the cursor on the second character of each line, and hit\nDelete, RightArrow, Delete, RightArrow, until the end of the line.  It\nwon't take long, and (although I know it's very sad to say so) it does\nproduce a rather nice effect.\n\n---------------------------------------\nSpoiler 1\n~~~~~~~~~\nWMhaernt ianl lt hteh eh acpopnyt isnoecnkt sh iitns  ay otuirm eh ezaodn e\naorne  al ilta,r gaen  weaxltlr am acdoen toifn epnett e-  aAntdl aDnatvies\n-I  wkinlolw  atphpaeta ri so nr utbhbei smha pb.u t  EDxop lyoorue\ntchairse  cao nhtoionte nIt  dtoon ts twaarntt  Gtloo bpault\nDaonmyi npautnicotnu,a tai 1620  isne choenrde  Fsriennczey  iwti twhi\nelalc hm askwei ticth  twooor tohb 157050OKs o*r r(yl iatb\ncoountt itnheantt sl)a.p s eO nien  csotnutpiindeintty  ibsu tl iit  haatd\ntthoe  psutta rsto;m et hneu mrbaemrps  ainnd  istp ilninkeer  atnoy\nroanmep  wciolmlb or elaidg htth icso natniynweanyt si  irne atlhley\nnhoorpmea ly ofua sahrieonnt.  d eIcfo dyionug  laitg htth ea lwlr\ntohneg  cpoanrtiitnye notns ,p utrhpeo ssew itthcaht  vwaoluuled\nbbeec oomdeds  25AM .\n\n---------------------------------------\nSpoiler 2\n~~~~~~~~~\nNMoo owsaey...\n\n---------------------------------------\nSpoiler 3\n~~~~~~~~~\nAT htei mqeudi c5k- bbarlolw nf rfeonxz yj ufmopre d132401  soevceorn dtsh.e\nBloatzhy  odrobgi tnso wa nids  rtahmep st iamree  floirt :a lslh ogooto\nadn ym eonf  wtehlels ei tt os aeynsa bmleen  obnuet  oIf  stuhpep\nCorsyes tiatl  iFsr argamtehnetrs ,* etxhiesnt  sihno otth itsh ed\ncaryy satnadl  atgoe  lwohcikc ha  ib aklnlo wt hae rleo.t   oAff tpeero\ntphlee  chraytset ablu ts hnoetv,e rt hmei nrde.m aNionwi nigs  sthhoet st\nwiimlel  froerl iaglhlt .g o oAdf tpeerr slooncsk itnhga ttsh eb\nfeotutretrh  tboa lclo,m et hteo  ctrhyes taaild  roefl itghhet sp afrotry\ntahse  iffi ntahle ys haoctt utaol lsym awsohu ltdh ea sC riyts tiasl\nain de xspaevcet  tthhee yu nwiovuelrdsnet.  e vTehne  vlootcek sf oarr e\nwtohretmh.  2157Ms,+ 1520TM!,t 2705WM0,d naan db 0110001Ms;  btihnea\nfriyn,anli cseh.o.t  ainsy wwaoyr tih  t715209Mh,i nmka kii nwga st hgeo\ntiontga lo n1 Ba.b o uItf  pyeooup lfea inlo,t  tciommei ntgr atvoe lt\nahgea iani dt oo fr etphlea yp aTritmyewshhiocchk  wFarse nfzayi;r\nyloyu  aailmsloe sgse tr etahlel yo phpeoyr tausn iit ya mt ow rTiitmien\nTgr atvheils  aiftt eirs  smuyc cbeierdtihndga.y   TTohmeo rMraoswtyeary\nOIf  hToipmee  mayw adrrdi vies  ggeitvse nf ifxoerd  tshoeo\nfna sstoe sIt  ccaonm palcettuiaolnl yo fp lTaiym etshhiosc kg\nFarmeen zayg.h\n\n---------------------------------------\nSpoiler 4\n~~~~~~~~~\nWlhiesnn gyaoiut theahveeo n8y rTfaocdhuyloanuiaudmo tahnudp thaaevte\nceotmmpilaebtoetdn rTtiymyeesahoorcrke pflrpetnlzyyn,o atkhrec luhnhklnaoqwrnt\netnitorsyn cwdihlile ucihnatnwguee mtsoa iTphcel lEenldr noufa mTtiimseg.\nSseelreucdta otiheissb gaanhds ntiiemsen wteraayvrenla dtihbefroeg ntso\nagcmteifvaabttes rWtiezuaoredi dFsrteendzhya!o r aTohsiesh binss nag a6\nboailoln cfdreewnoziym efrosrh i6a0o msmescrotnedesw,t ratnidi ttihiel\nftotlrlootwaimnagm nairsef eatcsteicvtea:i wTsiamnet iMtaocsheihnte\nFhrseinczuyb,r yQaugitcskdsdhtoqts hMnadnbihae,d lUhlsthrtah rJaeitnsl,o\nReaimgpe aReaomhpdajgeei,o aUiluttreae eSbpeiintnlears,a tUtletrrra\nFoihnidr lTfhfem aCoohwt,o yUglitircav iTuinmreh eWnaernph oFhrdewntzsyt,p\natntdn oGlleorbmahlb tDsogmsinntadtkiaotnr.s t(e!w)k n iIgft nyeonu\nshcyoarmey g1eBI itaoftnaolh,i etnhteh sesxotertat gbdatluly ilriaghhetfsi,r\nbeuatl dyeoiui wmhulsoto oceoolflaehcito iimtn edxuoroihnogp etthhe\nFrrweannzayt soirs oittt tgyodeusn aatwtahye.o\n\nMany thanks to Ade and Champie for making this wonderful game, and for\n  not releasing it until after my finals :)\n\nThe official list of wonderful contributors:\n    Malcolm Peach              mpeach@netcomuk.co.uk\n    Keith Johnson              keefer@access.digex.net\n    David Smith                D.M.Smith@lancs.ac.uk\n--\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Timeshock!", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/timeshock.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

General Description\nThe Who's Tommy (or just Tommy for short) is a Data East machine, officially\nreleased early February 1994 at PAPA-4. IMHO it is one of the best DE games,\nand with TFTC moving to 2nd place as best DE machine.  Tommy is based on the\nBroadway show of the same name. One of the things that makes it great is that\nit is one of the few pinball machines with a pinball theme! Because of it's\ntheme, I've included a synopsis of the story (see Section 3).\n\nThe pin is of standard DE (24\") width. It has three flippers: the two normal\nones, and a left side flipper similar in position to the side flipper in\nFunhouse. It has the standard triangular slingshots above each flipper, one inlane\nand one outlane on each side, and a dot-matrix display.\n\nAs with TFTC, this game is part of a new generation of DE machines, with a very\nwell thought-out rule set and a good score balance (except perhaps the double\nsuper jackpot, but that is not easy to get at all.) It is a mode-based game,\nand modes can run concurrently as in JP, TAF, and TZ.\n\n3. Tommy: The Story\nThe theme of this game is very well integrated; each mode, called a Union Jack\n(abbreviated UJ) feature represents one of the scenes in the play. The music\nplayed during the UJ also corresponds to that scene, and things like the Extra\nBall are worked in really well. For those that haven't seen the Broadway play,\nor are not quite familiar with the story, here is a brief synopsis. Note that\nnot all the scenes are represented in the game, but most have been. The names\nin parentheses represent the songs for the scene.\n\nAct I\nOverture: 1940: Against the backdrop of World War II appears a montage of the\nWalkers' meeting, courtship, marriage, Captain Walker's departure for the front\nand capture, and his internment in a POW camp. (Overture)\n\nScene 1: 22 Heathfield Gardens, 1940: Back in London, two officers arrive at 22\nHeathfield Gardens to bring Mrs. Walker tragic news (Captain Walker).\n\nScene 2: Hospital, 1941: A nurse gently hands Mrs. Walker her newborn son (It's\na Boy). The scene blends into the 1942-1945 years in the prison camp, ending\nwith (We've Won).\n\nScene 3: Heathfield Gardens 1945: Captain Walker is freed and heads home,\narriving as Mrs. Walker is celebrating her 21st birthday with her lover and\nfour-year old son (Twenty-One). Returning unexpectedly from the war, Captain\nWalker appears at the door late at night to find Mrs. Walker and her lover in\nan embrace.  The lover attacks Captain Walker, and the four-year-old Tommy is\nwoken up by the commotion. Mrs. Walker tries to turn him away from the violent\nscene, but he faces a mirror in which he witnesses the lover slapping his\nmother and threatening to attack his father with a chair. The father shoots the\nlover in the head. The Walkers embrace, helplessly, then realize that Tommy\nhas seen it all in the mirror. They proceed to tell Tommy \"you didn't hear it,\nyou didn't see it, you won't say nothing to no one ...\" (What about the Boy.)\nTommy just stares at the mirror. The police separate the Walkers for\nquestioning while the older Tommy, the Narrator, appears on top of the wardrobe\nas if by magic (Amazing Journey).\n\nScene 4: The Courtroom, 1945: Captain Walker is found not guilty, but the\nfamily celebration dies out as they realize Tommy is now deaf, dumb, and\nblind.\n\nScene 5: Hospital, 1945. A battery of doctors and nurses examine Tommy\n(Sparks).\n\nScene 6: Church and the home of the relatives, Cousin Kevin and his parents,\n1950:  The Walkers take ten-year-old Tommy to church and family dinners\n(Christmas) where he responds to Uncle Ernie's playing the French Horn and the\nolder Tommy's unseen presence (See Me Feel Me).\n\nScene 7: 22 Heathfield Gardens, 1950: Back home, the Walkers worry about\nwhether to leave Tommy with the drunken Uncle Ernie (Do You Think It's\nAlright), while once alone with Tommy, Ernie molests him (Fiddle About).\n\nScene 8: 22 Heathfield Gardens: Tommy's next baby-sitter, Cousin Kevin, taunts\nhim mercilessly (Cousin Kevin). Bored with Tommy, Cousin Kevin jokingly stands\nhim in front of the Youth Center's pinball machine. Tommy begins to play and\nthe machine comes to life. The youths begin to gather around him. He plays\nhypnotically, beating the machine, and begins to rack up an incredible score.\nLights flash, bells ring, buzzers sound. The youths start cheering Tommy on as\nthe Narrator magically appears above him (Sensation).\n\nScene 9: Psychiatric Clinic: Encouraged, the Walkers try yet another doctor, a\npsychiatrist, who tests Tommy without success (Sparks, reprise).\n\nScene 10: 22 Heathfield Gardens: A desperate Mr. Walker steps outside his door\nfor a smoke when he is accosted by a couple of rather unsavory characters, the\nHawker and Harmonica Players, who promise a miraculous cure for Tommy (Eyesight\nto the Blind).\n\nScene 11: The Isle of Dogs: They take Tommy and his father to the Isle of Dogs\nto find a drug-addicted prostitute called The Gypsy (Acid Queen), then Mr.\nWalker ends by snatching the boy back in horror.\n\nScene 12: Amusement Arcade, 1958: The act ends in 1958 as a group of teenagers\nawait 17-year-old Tommy's appearance at the amusement arcade (Pinball Wizard):\n\n\n\nFirst Local Lad\nEver since I was a young boy,\nI've played the silver ball,\nFrom Soho down to Brighton,\nI must have played them all.\nBut I ain't seen nothing like him\nIn any amusement hall.\nThat dead, dumb, and blind kid\nSure plays a mean pinball!\nSecond Local Lad\nHe stands like a statue,\nBecomes part of the machine.\nFeeling all the bumpers,\nAlways playing clean.\nHe plays by intuition,\nThe digit counters fall,\nThat deaf, dumb and blind kid ...\n...

Sure plays a mean pinball!\n\n\n\nAct II\nUnderture, 1960: Tommy is playing at a pinball machine, surrounded by the\nyouths.  Tommy, at 20, is a neighborhood celebrity and the adored official\nmascot of this particular local gang. His playing builds to a fever pitch; a\nbuzzer sounds as he beats the machine. The lads scream in victory, and carry\nTommy over their heads down the street, with Cousin Kevin leading the way\n(Underture).\n\nScene 13: The Sunlight Laundrette: The local lads carry the inert Tommy into\nthe laundrette, where Mrs. Walker watches their loutish but lively behavior\nwith sadness. They deposit Tommy on a chair and depart (It's a Boy, reprise).\nMr. Walker, still in search of a cure, convinces Mrs. Walker to try once more\n(There's a Doctor).\n\nScene 14: A Research Laboratory: They take Tommy to specialists for elaborate\ntests, to no avail (Go to the Mirror/Listening to You).\n\nScene 15: The Street/22 Heathfield Gardens: On the street, a group of local\nlouts surround Tommy and carry him home (Tommy, Can You Hear Me?). The image\nof Tommy as a ten-year-old magically appears in the mirror, and screams Tommy,\nTommy, Tommy Tommy, Tommy. Tommy crosses to the mirror and stares.\n\nScene 16: 22 Heathfield Gardens: Oblivious to young Tommy in the mirror, the\nWalkers sit at the table. Mrs. Walker shuffles a deck of cards. The Walkers are\nconsidering having Tommy institutionalized (I Believe My Own Eyes). Tommy\ncontinues to stare into the mirror. Mrs. Walker tries to pull Tommy away from\nthe mirror but each time one of the younger Tommys appears in the mirror, Tommy\ntries to move toward it. Mrs. Walker picks up a chair and threatens to smash\nthe mirror with it, \"Do you hear or fear or Do I smash the mirror?\" In the\nmirror, the image of the four-year-old Tommy on the night of the killing long\nago. Mrs.  Walker furiously swings back the chair ... Darkness ... and the\nsound of breaking glass. The mirror has been completely smashed (Smash The\nMirror). Tommy looks around and sees everything in the room. He stands in the\nspot where the lover was killed. He looks at his mother and reaches out to\ntouch her. She embraces him, but he does not return it. She rushes off to get\nMr. Walker. With the mirror in pieces, Tommy leaves home. (I'm Free).\n\nScene 17: The Streets of London; 1961-1963: Tommy's cure hits the news (Miracle\nCure):\n\n\nExtra! Extra!\nRead all about it!\nThe pinball wizard in a miracle cure!\nExtra! Extra!\nRead all about it!\n\n\nTommy is Lionized by the public and the press (I'm Free/Pinball Wizard,\nreprise).\n\nScene 18: The Stadium: Tommy's Holiday Camp: Tommy begins appearing in\nstadiums, where Uncle Ernie tries to capitalize on his stardom.\n\nScene 19: Sally's House/The Stadium: Teenage Sally Simpson manages to get on\nstage and touch Tommy but, when he pushes her aside, she falls and is pummeled\nby the guards (Sally Simpson).\n\nScene 20: 22 Heathfield Gardens: Aghast, Tommy realizes how caught up in the\ncelebrity machine he has become. He tends to her and invites everyone back to\nhis house (Welcome). Once there, Sally asks Tommy how she can be more like him\n(Sally Simpson's Question) Tommy insists there is no reason to be like him; who\nshe is, is enough. Disenchanted with their hero for failing to provide instant\nsalvation, the crowd turns on him and leaves (We're Not Going to Take It),\nuntil Sally is the only fan left. Tommy turns to her, but she walks out after\nthe others. As Tommy crosses back to the mirror, the family fears he may have a\nrelapse.\n\nFinale: The image in the mirror is now the ten-year-old Tommy. The two Tommys\nreach for each other tenderly (See Me, Feel Me, reprise). Tommy seems to be\nreverting to his old state, but instead he turns to his family and embraces\nthem in acceptance and reunion with his younger selves (Listening to You,\nreprise).\n\n4. Playfield Layout\nIn this section, the layout is described with the terminology I'll use for the\nrest of the rules sheet. Going from left to right:\n\n\nLeft inlane  Pretty standard. Lights the right spinner for double-value.\nAlso, if there is no UJ feature currently running and the UJ is not lit,\nthen it will light it for about 2 seconds unless you have already been\nthrough Pinball Wizard UJ.\n\nLeft outlane  No kickback! And there is rubber on the post separating the\ninlane and outlane. Finally DE is learning! Collect Special here when lit\n(via completing GENIUS).\n\nLeft-bank-targets  Three plastic targets, with triangular lights pointing to\nthem. Hitting a target lights the light. Lighting all 3 increases the left\nspinner value by 25K a spin, and scores 5M, 10M, 15M, then 20M for\nall subsequent completions. It resets back to 5M between balls. The\nunlit left scoop spots a left side target. These targets are also used in\nsome UJ features.\n\nLeft scoop  When the union-jack is lit, it starts the flashing UJ. UJ's can be\nstarted from this scoop only until Pinball Wizard has been reached.\nTommy Multiball can also be started here (see Section 6). This scoop is\nalso used in the acid queen UJ.\n\nUpper left flipper  This sideways-facing flipper is designed for two\nprimary shots: the Tommy mirror/hole, and the right ramp. You can also\nhit the `more time' target or some of the silver ball targets from this\nflipper.\n\nLeft spinner/orbit  Each spin scores the current spinner value, which\nbegins as 25K a spin, and increases each time the left bank targets are\ncompleted, to a maximum value of 1M. The value is doubled (thus max 2M per\nspin) if the ball just went through the right inlane. At the top of the\nlane is a switch, which is the `orbit' switch. This switch relights the UJ.\nNormally the ball loops around the orbit feeding the right flipper quite\nfast, but not too fast (i.e. Mach speed, not warp speed :-)), so it is\npossible to make these loops, which are worth 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M. After the 4th\nloop, all loops are worth 5M for the rest of the game. Note that to score\nthese loop values does not have to be continuous loops. There is also an\norbit diverter, which is active at various times in the game to send the\nball into the pop bumpers, instead of orbiting all around.\n\nLeft ramp  This ramp is quite easy to hit from the right flipper. It is used to\ncount down the captain walker mode, to collect the single jackpot(s)\nduring Tommy Multiball, and during the Sally Simpson UJ feature and\nCaptain Walker (non-UJ) mode. On a shallow table or with very strong\nflippers, the left ramp can be backhanded from the left flipper.\n\nSilver ball targets  these are 3 white targets with the picture of a pinball\non the playfield. Two of them are on either side of the left ramp, while\none of them is just above the right ramp. Hitting each one twice lights the\nsilver ball for 20M. Initially the lights for these targets are off. After\none hit, they are flashing. After two hits they are solid. These targets\nare also used during the Silver Ball and Cousin Kevin UJs.\n\nGenius lane  This lane is similar to the one in Funhouse, and is the easiest\nway to feed the upper left flipper. Each hit (while not in Multiball)\nawards the next letter in the following words: OK, WOW, GOOD,\nSUPER, and GENIUS. Collecting each word awards the point value of\n5M, 10M, 15M, 20M, and 25M respectively, and 25M for each\nsubsequent spelling of GENIUS. The first completion of GENIUS lights\nspecial at the outlanes. Many modes prevent the completion of a word, but\nallow you to spot all but the last letter in the word. There is also an EB\nto be awarded for completing one of these, instead of the points. This is\nan annoying self-adjusting feature (almost as bad as whether or not you\nget the EB in Holodeck on STTNG) which self-adjusts between every\ngame. I've seen the EB awarded for completing WOW (easiest I've\nseen), and for completing SUPER (hardest I've seen). Normally it\nshould give it to you for completing GOOD. This lane is also where\nyou collect the EB after collecting the Lite EB UJ and for the Mystery,\nwhich is lit by right ramp shots, and is used in the Acid Queen UJ.\n\nSilver ball  This ball scores 20M when flashing. When not flashing, it\nspots one hit on one of the silver ball targets. It is also used in the\nSilver Ball UJ, and is part of a combo which results in the Sigma Bonus\n(See Section 7). Hitting this target also advances the next UJ to be\nawarded to be the next one that has not yet been collected.\n\nPop bumpers  The standard triangular combination. The pop bumpers\nrotate the ready UJ (as in TAF and TZ), and are used in the There's a\nDoctor UJ. Pop bumpers start off at 100K per hit, and increase by 100K\nfor every 10 hits to a maximum of 1M per pop. This resets on each ball.\nThe Super Pops mystery award sets the value immediately to its\nmaximum of 1M. There is a pin that pops up at the back of the bumpers,\nwhich can cause balls going through the orbit to be redirected into the\npop bumpers.\n\nParachute  A very wide hole at the top-right of the playfield, which is for\nthe skill shot. The ball often lands in here during normal play\n(especially during multiball) in which case the value of the next skill shot is\nincreased by 5M.\n\nTommy mirror  This is a mirror which is similar to the tombstone in\nTFTC. Unfortunately the mirror doesn't register half the hits to it, so it\ncan get frustrating. Each hit spots a letter in T-O-M-M-Y. Completing\nTOMMY lowers the mirror, and exposes the Tommy Hole. The mirror\nis also used in a couple of the UJs.\n\nTommy hole  this is a hole behind the mirror, and it is well designed in that\nballs sent to it do not bounce out! Generally this is only exposed when\nTommy multiball is lit; shoot it to start multiball. During Tommy\nmultiball it is also a mini-jackpot which must be collected five times to light\nthe super jackpots. Any ball in this hole is fed to the right flipper.\n\nRight ramp  this ramp can only be hit by the upper left flipper. It is about\nas easy/difficult to hit as the side ramp in TAF. Rumor has it that this\nramp can be hit from the left flipper with a real weird bounce (let's see\nLyman call that one!) During normal play, it counts down to the\nMystery feature, which becomes lit at the GENIUS lane. To light the\nMystery feature, you need 2 ramp shots the first time, 3 the second time, etc.\nDuring Tommy multiball, the double jackpot(s) is collected on this\nramp. The ramp is also used in the Sally Simpson UJ and Captain\nWalker (not UJ) modes.\n\nMore-time target  This is a single plastic target below the right ramp,\nwhich when hit resets the timer in most timed modes. Resetting the\ntime can only be done once per mode. If multiple modes are running\nconcurrently, it resets the timer for the most recent mode. If you start a\nno-more-time mode right after a more-time mode, the more time target\ndoes nothing for either mode.\n\nRight scoop  This scoop awards the flashing UJ when lit. Hard shots into\nthis scoop occasionally bounce out, but nowhere near as bad as on IJ.\nThe shot can also be hit from a right-flipper backhand. Shots into this\nhole are fed to the right flipper via a VUK. This is also the eject for\nballs into the Tommy hole or parachute. The scoop is also used in the\nAcid Queen UJ.\n\nRight spinner/orbit  As with the left orbit, the spinners score 25K per spin\ninitially, and go up by 25K for each completion of the right bank of\ntargets. There is a switch at the top of the orbit which relights the UJ. Just\nbeyond the left of the entrance of this orbit there is a hole. This is a\nsecret passage to the right scoop, and awards the next UJ if it is lit. I\ndon't know if this secret passage awards a UJ if not lit. The ball only\nlands here by luck.\n\nCaptive Ball  The captive ball advances the end-of-ball bonus multiplier\nby 1x for each hit, to a maximum of 7x, and spots a right-bank target.\nAfter 7x, you get 10M a shot. It is also used during the Holiday Camp\nUJ. This shot is not that hard to make, but it is dangerous, in that the\nball often deflects towards the right outlane or SDTM. Depending on\nhow it bounces on your machine, you might want to avoid it, as there is\nno feature that forces you to make this shot.\n\nRight-bank-targets  Just like the left-bank-targets described above, except\nthat they increase the value of the right spinner instead, and targets are\nspotted with the captive ball.\n\nRight inlane  Pretty standard. Lights the left spinner for double-value.\nAlso, if there is no UJ feature currently running and the UJ is not lit,\nthen it will light the scoops for about 2 seconds unless Pinball Wizard\nUJ has been reached in the game.\n\nRight outlane  There is rubber on the post separating the inlane and\noutlane. Collect Special here when lit (via completing GENIUS).\n\nPlunger  This is both a manual and automatic plunger, as on Checkpoint.\nSee Section 8 for more details.\n\nBlinders  You can't see them, and when you can see them, you can't see\nthe flippers! The blinders are a fan which come out and cover the\nflippers, up to about two inches above the flippers. The idea with the\nblinders is that you are playing blind, just like Tommy. The blinders are used\nduring the Tommy Scoring and Pinball Wizard UJ features, as well as\nafter collecting a super jackpot. You can also start a game such that the\nblinders are active for the entire game by holding the EB-buy-in button\nwhen you press the Start button.\n\n\n5. Union-Jack\nAs with many of the modern games, there are many modes, which are called\nUnion-Jack (UJ) features. The UJ is bright blue and red on the playfield, so\nyou can't miss it! The game always starts with Christmas UJ flashing; the\nflashing UJ changes with the pop bumpers and the silver ball.\n\nTo collect the flashing UJ, shoot either the left or right scoop when lit.\nAfter collecting a UJ, you must shoot one of the orbits to relight it. You can\nnormally relight the UJ during another mode; the only exceptions are if you\nhave a multiball mode going, in which case starting other modes is disabled,\nand you can't relight the UJ either. If there is no UJ running, and the scoops\nare not lit, then either inlane will light the scoops for about 2 seconds. The\nUJ is automatically lit at the beginning of each ball.\n\nAt the completion of each UJ, you are told how many points you got for the\nUJ, but the points are awarded when you get them, not when this final tally\nis displayed.\n\nFollowing are the 12 UJs. Collecting all 12 starts the Pinball Wizard UJ.\nThey are listed in the order that they rotate when the pop bumpers or silver\nball are hit.\n\n\nChristmas  This is a 20-second round, during which all playfield switches\nscore 300K. Hitting any 3-bank target increases this value by 100K.\nThe roving flashing target on the 3-banks adds 5M to the Christmas\ntotal. The orbit diverter is active during this round, and the more-time\ntarget resets the timer.\n\nCousin Kevin  This is a 20-second round, during which the three ramp\ntargets are flashing. The first time each ramp target is hit, it becomes lit\nand an additional ball is launched into play (thus you can get a\nmaximum of 4 balls in play). When the timer has expired, play continues\nuntil fewer than two balls remain in play. The ramp targets are worth\n5M throughout this round. No other rounds can be started during\nCousin Kevin. The more-time target resets the timer. If multiball is lit,\nthen it becomes unlit until this feature ends.\n\nHoliday Camp  This is a round during which the captive ball is initially\nworth 1M, counting up to 20M. The value may be collected repeatedly.\nThe round expires after the value reaches 20M. The captive ball is a\ndangerous shot, so you may want to skip this mode.\n\nLite Extra Ball  This feature lights an Extra Ball at the Genius Lane. If\nextra balls are disabled, then EB is still lit, but collecting it scores\n25M instead.\n\nSilver Ball  This is a 20-second round, during which the Silver ball is\ninitially worth 10M, and the ramp targets score 5M. Collecting the Silver\nball value increments all of these values by 5M. Values may be\ncollected repeatedly. The more-time target resets the timer. It is possible to\nscore over 100M in this round by pounding on the Silver Ball, and\nhitting the more-time target with only 1 or 2 seconds to get another 15 to\n20 seconds with the higher silver ball value.\n\nCaptain Walker  This is a videolamo mode, during which the flipper\nbuttons steer your bomber on-screen. The left button moves up, the right\nbutton moves down. Hit anything (bombs, planes, and buildings) Firing\nis automatic. The maximum value of this mode is 17M. I usually\naverage 10M on it if I try, and 13M if I just leave the plane on the bottom,\ntake a sip of my drink, and come back when the mode is over. Rumor\nhas it that this mode is intentionally lame so that the programmers send\na message to the designers that they don't want video modes anymore\n... but as I said, it is only a rumor ...\n\nSmash The Mirror  This is a two-ball Multiball, during which the raised\nMirror is lit for Jackpots of 5M, 10M, 15M, 20M, and 25M, after which\nthe Mirror lowers and the Tommy hole is lit for 50M, after which the\nsequence repeats. This round ends whenever at least one ball drains. If\nmultiball is lit, then it becomes unlit until this feature ends.\n\nFiddle About  This is a 20-second round, during which the 3-bank targets\n(all six) are lit for an initial value of 5M. Hitting any target increases\nits subsequent value by 1M, to a maximum of 10M per target.\n\nAcid Queen  This is a round during which the right scoop, left scoop, and\nGenius lane are lit for an initial value of 25M, counting down to 10M.\nCollecting any one of these shots adds 10M to the running value for the\nremaining two shots. Collecting another shot adds 10M to the remaining\nvalue. The round ends after the shots have counted down to 10M.\nThere is about a 3 second delay once the counter has reached 10M. The\nmore-time target does not apply.\n\nThere's A Doctor  This is a 20-second round where you start with 5M; the\npop bumpers and sling shots are lit for 1M per hit. After 20 hits, 25M\nbonus is awarded (for a total of 50M in the round) and the round ends.\nAlso, as long as you are in the pop-bumpers the timer does not expire,\nas each hit with less than 2 seconds resets the timer to 2 seconds. The\norbit diverter is active during this round. The more-time target resets\nthe timer.\n\nTommy Scoring  This is a 3-ball Multiball, during which the blinder is\nactive and all playfield switches score 500K. The round ends when fewer\nthan two balls remain in play. No other rounds can be started during\nTommy Scoring. The orbit diverter is active during this round.  Don't worry\nabout losing all 3 balls suddenly. If you lose the 3rd ball as well, the\nball saver kicks in and you get that ball back. If multiball is lit, then\nit becomes unlit until this feature ends.\n\nSally Simpson  This is a 20-second round, during which the ramps are lit\nfor an initial value of 5M. Hitting the left ramp increases the subsequent\nvalue by 2M. Hitting the right ramp doubles the subsequent value. The\nmore-time target resets the timer.\n\nPinball Wizard  This is a 6-ball Multiball, during which the blinder is\nactive and all playfield switches score 1M. Collecting 25 switch\nclosures awards an additional 20M and the letter W. The next 50 switch\nclosures awards 30M and the letter I. This continues for all letters in\nWIZARD, (Z=40M, A=50M, etc.). Completing a letter also launches\nan additional ball into play. The round ends when fewer than two balls\nremain in play.\n\n\n6. Multiball\nMultiball is lit by hitting the Mirror to spell TOMMY during single ball\nplay. When completed, the Mirror lowers and Multiball is lit at the Mirror\nscoop and the left scoop. Regular Multiball is 4-ball play; starting Multiball\nfrom the left scoop is only 3-ball play. Subsequent Multiballs are not lit at\nthe left scoop.\n\nUntil you get the first multiball, 2 letters are spotted at the beginning of\neach ball, thus guaranteeing you a chance at multiball by the 3rd ball.\nIdeally, though, you get at least one mirror hit on ball 1, which then lights\nmultiball during the 2nd ball, giving you more chance to collect it. Multiball\ncan be very lucrative, so you definitely want to go for it whenever it is lit.\n\nModes continue running during multiball (but they do pause the timers\nduring the multiball opening animation!).\n\nAs has become customary on DE games since JP, there are several stages to\nmultiball, and completing one stage lets you move on to the next.\n\n\nStage 1  Jackpots: At the start of multiball, the left ramp is lit for Jackpot,\nand the right ramp for Double Jackpot. Initial jackpot value is 20M if you\nstart at the Tommy hole, 15M if you start with the left scoop (or 40M and\n30M for Double Jackpot). All playfield switches increase the Jackpot value\nby 200K, and the Double Jackpot value by 400K. Collecting any Jackpot\nlaunches an additional ball into play. When BOTH Jackpots are completed,\nboth are relit.\n\nStage 2  3rd Jackpot. Collect either the single or double jackpot by\nshooting one of the ramps. Jackpots continue to rise by 200K/400K a switch,\nand the initial value is carried over from stage 1. After ONE of the two\njackpots, an additional ball is launched into play, and you move on to\nthe next stage.\n\nStage 3  Spell Tommy: The Tommy hole spots the letters T-O-M-M-Y and\neach one scores a 20M jackpot (which does not increase). No balls are\nadded to play for collecting these jackpots. Completing TOMMY\nmoves you to Stage 4. In 3.00 ROMs and later, each switch adds 1M to\nthe Super Jackpot and 2M to the Double Super Jackpot.\n\nStage 4  Super Jackpots: The left ramp is lit for the super jackpot, and the\nleft ramp is lit for the double super jackpot. The initial values are\n250M and 500M respectively, and go up by 1M and 2M respectively for\neach playfield switch. You can only collect one of these two, so if you\nare going for the big points, avoid the temptation of shooting the much\neasier left ramp, and go for the right ramp. When you collect ONE of\nthe super jackpots, you move to Stage 5.\n\nStage 5  Blind Multiball. You go back to stage 1 of the multiball, but the\nblinders are active, and you do not get any new balls added if you\ncollect a jackpot. Initial jackpot values return to their base values. If you\ncomplete Stages 1 through 4 with the blinders active, then you must be\nTommy, THE pinball wizard! (PS. I heard Lyman has done it :-)).\n\n\nIf you don't collect at least one jackpot, then the left scoop and mirror are\nrelit for 2-ball multiball (which is not as bad as it seems, because collecting\na jackpot still adds a ball into play, so you can still end up with up to 5\nball multiball).\n\nAfter the first multiball, only the Tommy hole is lit to start/restart\nmultiball.  Note, even though the left scoop is not lit to start multiball, it\ndoesn't let you collect UJ modes if multiball is lit at the Tommy hole; bug?\n\n7. Other Modes\nThere are some modes/features which are not started as UJ features.\n\nCaptain Walker: During single ball play, the left ramp advances towards\nCaptain Walker mode (not the same as the Union Jack feature). 2 ramp\nshots required to start it first time, 3 for second time, etc. The Captain\nWalker round is a 20-second round, during which the left ramp is worth\n5M, the right ramp is worth 10M, and the spinners are initially worth\n100K, increasing by 100K for each ten spins, to a maximum of 1M per\nspin. Hitting the more-time target resets the timer.\n\nMystery: During single ball play, the right ramp advances towards lighting\nMystery at the GENIUS lane. The possible awards are the following:\n\n\n Max Bonus X: Set the end-of-ball bonus multiplier to 7x.\n Max Skill Shot: Raise the value of all subsequent skill shots to 50M.\n Double Scoring: Scoring is doubled for next 20 seconds; however\nyou cannot start Tommy multiball nor start a UJ, so what's the point?\n Super Pops: Pop bumpers are worth 1M a hit for rest of ball.\n Million Spinners: Set spinners to maximum 1M per spin for rest of ball.\n Silver Ball Lit: The silver ball is lit for 20M, same as completing 2\nhits of each silver ball target.\n Extra Ball: haven't seen it myself, but apparently it's possible.\n Special Lit: ditto what I said the previous line!\n\n\n8. Skill Shot\nI really like the thought that has gone into the skill shot on Tommy, as there\nare various possibilities, which allow you to combine skill and strategy.\n\nFirst of all, you have the choice of using either the manual or automatic\nplunger (they make everybody happy :-)). I'm sure you know how to\nmanually plunge the ball. To use the automatic plunger, flip both flippers at the\nsame time. Be careful though; I have a habit of flipping the flippers before I\nlaunch the ball just to loosen up my fingers. Do this on this game and you'll\naccidentally launch the ball. If you want to check the status report, hold\ndown one flipper and don't press the other one. When the status report\nstarts, then you can hit the other one to page through the status; but do it\nbefore that and you launch the ball.\n\nThere are several things to shoot for:\n\n\nParachute  the parachute is lit on ball 1 for an initial value of 10M.\nHitting from the plunger shot awards that value, and raises the next value\nby 5M. Hitting the parachute at any time during normal play advances\nthis skill shot value, but does not score the value. This skill shot maxes\nout at 50M.\n\nRight ramp  this is a flipper skill shot. Instead of shooting for the\nparachute (or if you over shoot by too much) the ball is fed to the upper left\nflipper, for a shot at the right ramp. Hitting it scores 10M, and advances\nyou one notch closer to the mystery award.\n\nTommy hole  if multiball is ready and the parachute skill shot is lit, then\nshoot the ball around the orbit to the top left flipper. If you hit the\nTommy hole with that shot, you score the oxymoron One Way Combo (Section\n9), and start multiball. If you choose to go for this skill shot, make sure\nthat the mirror is all the way down before launching the ball.  The mirror\ntakes about 4 seconds to lower, so if you launch too quickly, it might not\nbe all the way down and you'll be very very upset about not starting\nmultiball if you make your shot.\n\n\nGenerally I shoot for the parachute. However, if multiball is lit, and it is\nball 3, I'll probably go for the Tommy hole instead. If it's ball 2, I figure I\nhave lots of time to start multiball, so I'll go for the skill shot points.\nAlso, if the skill shot points are worth 40M or 50M, then I might even shoot\nthat on ball 3 with multiball lit. But you see what I mean, there is strategy\ninvolved on top of skill!\n\n9. Combos and Bonuses\nThere are various combos and bonuses in this game, and they are not the\nkind you expect as in Williams and Bally games. Most of them are quite\nunique. Here are the ones I've seen. Let me know if you find any others:\n\n\nOne Way Combo  This is worth 5M, and it is scored by shooting the\nTommy hole when Tommy multiball is lit.\n\nExtra Ball Combo  This is worth 5M. It is scored by lighting the UJ extra\nball, and immediately collecting it without hitting any other switch. It\nworks after light EB from either left scoop or right VUK.\n\nSigma Bonus  This is worth 10M, and named after our fellow R.G.P.er\nKevin Martin. It is scored when you shoot the silver ball, and deflect\ninto the Tommy hole when multiball is lit.\n\nLyman Bonus  This is worth 2M ... but a BIG 2M! It is named after our\nfellow R.G.P.er Lyman Sheats. If you drain and are within 2M of the\nreplay, you will be awarded an extra 2M, and hence you will get your\nreplay.\n\nInlane/Spinner combos  Shooting a spinner after going through the inlane\non the opposite side doubles the value of that spinner for that shot.\n\nSilver-Ball Bonus  Hitting the silver ball after hitting each of the silver\nball targets twice scores 20M. The silver ball is flashing whenever lit\nfor this bonus.\n\n\nThere are apparently at least two other easter eggs that I haven't come\nacross, and newer ROMs (3.00 and later) have more combos, but since we\ndon't have those ROMs on our local machine, I can't tell you what they are.\n\n10. End-of-Ball Bonus\nThe end-of-ball bonus is 100K per left ramp, 200K per right ramp, and\n600K per UJ feature that you've started throughout the game, multiplied by\nthe Bonus Multiplier, which is a maximum of 7x. The multiplier is reset at\nthe beginning of each ball.\n\n11. Miscellaneous\nHere are a few items that didn't really fit anywhere else.\n\n\nExtra Ball Buy-in  As with most modern day games, there is an extra-ball\nbuy-in. You can use it only once per game.\n\nTommy mode  You can play an entire game with the blinders on by\nholding the extra-ball buy-in button when you hit the start button. I don't\nthink there is any lower replay value, though; there should be!\n\nReplays  Replay scores are typically between 200M and 300M on this\ngame. When you obtain a replay, the boost is 50M. The score is also\nboosted if you match! On Williams/Bally games, if you only have 1\ncredit with a boosted replay, and you add coins for a multi-player game,\nthe base replay is reset. This does not seem to be the case on Tommy.\nThe base replay score is only reset if there are no credits left before you\nstart any players game.\n\nHigh Scores  The default World Champion score is 1 Billion, with\nwho else's initials but LFS? Other default high scores are 900M, 800M,\n700M, 600M, and 500M. You get 3 credits for getting the World\nChampion score, 1 credit for 1st or 2nd score, and no credits for the other\nscores.\n\n\n12.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Transporter: The Rescue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Transporter: The Rescue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRules Sheet: Version 1.0 (November 17 1999)\nBally/Midway 1989 System 11B\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nIn this sheet, I'll use the abbreviation \"K\" for a thousand points, and\n\"M\" for a million points. When I refer to something in the game that has\na specific name, I'll capitalize the name so you know that you can find\ninfo about it here (sometimes I forgot). This is version 1.0, so there\nare some mistakes. Feel free to add to this sheet if you'd like.\nThere are a few things I don't know about this game, one for sure is the\nSuper Bonus scoring, so this is not considered a finished work yet.\nIf you'd like to contact me about anything I may have left out, please\ne-mail me. My e-mail is Dale.Stevens@engineer.com.\nThe organization of this rule sheet is similar to many found on the\ninternet. We'll take a guided tour of the playfield starting from\nthe bottom left and working our way up the left side to the top then back\ndown on the right side to the bottom. Then we'll describe in more\ndetail the text from the short rules on the index card that is displayed\non the game. The exact rules from the index card are included here\nand are written in bold type. With newer games the detail needed\nto understand the complex game rules that are available now that computer\nchips control the game can't fit on the small card. Finally, I'll\ndiscuss techniques and operator settings that can make playing the game\nmore enjoyable.\n\nGeneral Layout\n\nLeft & Right Out-Lanes:\nScore 20K points or Special When Lit. Out-Lanes drain the ball,\nbut the left side has a Kickback solenoid that is re-lit by completing\nthe RESCUE drop targets.\nLeft & Right In-lane:\nScore 5K, In-Lanes feed the flippers. They light the Spinner\n\"Double Score\" lamp for 5 seconds, and also Increases X-cellerator target\nscore when lit.\nLeft & Right Sling Shot:\nScores 10, Slings ball to the other side of the playfield. They\nalternate which side has the lit in-lane X-cellerator Lamp and increase\nthe value of the tens numeral for matching at the end of the game.\nLeft & Center Side R-E-S-C-U-E Drop Targets:\nScores 20K points initially then 30K each. That is, once a target\nis hit it scores 20K then drops below the playfield until all three targets\nfrom its group are completed, then all three targets are reset, independently\nfrom the other group of drop targets, and from then on score 30k each time\nthey are hit. During this time they are reset individually each time\nthey are hit (got it?). This allows for heavy duty scoring\nduring multi-ball. Completing all six RESCUE targets re-lights\nLeft Outlane Kickback and Lights ball lock on U.N. Orion Space Station\nor scores 50K points, increased by 50K for each additional completion per\nball, if ball locking is completed.\nU.N. Orion Space Station Ramp:\nScores 15K or 40K when lit for ball lock. Used to lock balls\nfor multi-ball. Unlocked balls are fed to the lower right flipper.\nThe Super Bonus is collected by shooting the X-cellerator target when the\nball is fed to the lower right flipper, or increase the Super Bonus by\nsuccessive shots up this ramp -- up to 1M.\nX-cellerator target:\nScores 5K, or 50K-250K when lit. Also used to collect Transporter bonus\nand Super Bonus Scoring. How the lights (40k-10k) that point to it\non the playfield score is an Enigma.\nTransporter:\nScore 10K. Sits above U.N. Orion Space Station & X-cellerator\ntarget: Only access is via upper right flipper across bridge.\nEach loop made increases Transporter bonus value up to 1 M. Score\nis displayed in lights on left side of Backglass. Score decreases\nover time if not collected.\nJet Bumpers:\nScores 1K points. Flings ball around randomly and should be helped\nby a little nudged of the cabinet.\nS-O-S In-Lanes:\nScore 20K points. Completing all three increases Bonus Multiplier\nor Lights Extra Ball. Center lane is extra ball target.\nSpinner Target and Lane:\nScore is operator adjustable from 1k-5k points. Has a Double\nScore lamp lit by the in-lanes.\nU.N. Orion Space Station:\nUsed to lock balls for multi-ball. Feeds either right lower or\nupper flipper depending on position of the wire gate that is controlled\nby a small solenoid.\nTransporter Pop Bumper:\nScores 10K points, feeds flipper to Transporter Bridge.\nBall Plunger Skill Shot:\nScores 50K initially, each skill shot increases the value of the next\nskill shot by 50K. A skill shot is available at the start of each ball\nand any extra balls, but not after locking a ball. Shoot the ball\nwith just enough spring tension so that the ball drops into the spinner\npath rather than going through the top gate and into the S-O-S lanes.\nThat is, underneath the U.N. Orion spaceship the spinner lane intersects\nthe shooter lane in an opening about 5 inches long, you need to drop the\nball into this opening so that the first score is the spinner target.\nPatience will allow you to get this shot most every time, because unlike\nother more difficult skill shots missing it on the short side will give\nyou another chance at it.\nOthers:\nBackglass shows current Transporter and Jackpot values. Music\nand Sounds are used to signal things that are happening during the game.\nPay attention to these sometimes subtle game cues; such as, Main theme,\nHigh Score Theme.\n\nRules\n\nS-O-S Lanes:\nLighting the top S-O-S lanes increase the Bonus Multiplier to 2X\nup to 5X, then lights Extra Ball. Multiplying the Bonus\nvalue can really pay off if you've just had a good ball so go for these\nS-O-S lights. What is the bonus you ask? It simply rewards\ngood ball play. Each time a significant shot is made such as drop\ntargets & X-cellerator target (there is no need to describe each and\nevery shot that increases the bonus it was hard enough getting the score\nfor each target), the bonus score adds up by 1k points (maybe more sometimes?).\nThe bonus score is awarded at the end of each ball and the bonus multiplier\nmultiplies its value. The bonus score is reset to zero for the next\nball. The bonus multiplier value is indicated by lights located along\nthe bottom of the playfield. Remember, you're also going for the\nextra ball here. The extra ball light is just below the center in-lane\n(letter O). There are many ways to shoot the S-O-S lanes.\nA shot from the right flipper straight up the center in-lane; i.e. the\nextra-ball shot, is awesome! Follow the monster's tentacle. Even\nif you miss this shot you'll feed the jet bumpers, which are located in\na \"classic\" position right below the in-lanes. It's fun to bump the\nmachine to keep the jet bumpers active thereby increasing the odds that\na jet bumper will shoot the ball up an in-lane. In addition there\nis the spinner lane, which you should go for when the \"Double Score\" lamp\nis lit.\nX-cellerator Target:\nReturn lanes increase X-cellerator target value from 50k up to 250k\n(as indicated on playfield). The X-cellerator target has triple\nduty, because it is also the target you shoot to collect the Transporter\nand Super bonuses. It's a hard target to see being located underneath\nthe transporter ramp. There is a sign on the ramp with an arrow that\npoints down to the X-cellerator target, just so you know that its there.\nAlso, the playfield has three green arrow lamps and a red arrow lamp that\nindicate when the Super Bonus is lit. These lights point to\nthe X-cellerator target and the line that they make help to line up the\nX-cellerator shot from the right flipper. You'll be shooting from\nthe right flipper a lot to collect the Super Bonus, while the Transporter\nBonus is collected from a left flipper shot, simply because of the way\nthese two bonuses are turned on. OK, so when you're not collecting\nthese bonuses, the X-cellerator is worth 5K unless you increase its value\nby entering the lit return lane. Only one return lane is lit at a\ntime, and hitting either slingshot will alternate which return lane is\nlit. The X-cellerator score is increased in increments of 50k up\nto 250k, but once the X-cellerator is hit its value goes back to 5k and\nyou start over. There are 5 lamps in the center of the playfield\nthat indicate the value of the X-cellerator target. When the target\nis only worth 5K the lamps flash in sequence.\nTransporter Shot:\nThe number of spins in the Transporter increases X-cellerator target\nvalue from 10K up to 1 Million (as indicated in Backglass).\nShoot the Transporter ball popper to feed ball to the upper flipper for\na shot across the bridge and into the Transporter ring. The transporter\nbonus is a possible 1M points! The transporter value is shown on\nthe left-hand side of the backglass in a transporter machine that looks\nlike an inverted V. Its difficult to get the value up to a million\nwith one shot, so shoot for the transporter bunker again as soon as the\nball drops down the ramp toward the left flipper. Multiple shots\nin succession will run the Transporter value up to 1M (listen for the male\nvoice to say \"Beam me up Bally!\"). It is worth 1M for a limited time\n(10-15 seconds via operator adj. # 37), then drops back down to 500k, and\ncontinues to drop in value over time.\nR-E-S-C-U-E Drop Targets:\nCompleting the R-E-S-C-U-E drop targets lights the lock in the U.N.\nOrion Spaceship. Making R-E-S-C-U-E thereafter increases the value\nof each RESCUE completion by 50K. The rescue drop targets\ncan play a predominant role in this game. Completing them all lights\nthe ball lock in the UN Orion Station, re-lights the left outlane kickback,\nare a source of potentially high scoring because each completion increases\nits scoring value by 50K, and completing them in sequence awards the Jackpot\nduring multi-ball. Since making R-E-S-C-U-E- in order during\nmultiball is required to collect the Jackpot, getting good at shooting\nthese targets can pay off\nMulti-Ball Play:\nDuring Multi-ball:\nComplete R-E-S-C-U-E in sequence to collect Jackpot (this\nsounds like a tough task!)\nShoot balls into Spaceship to light Outlanes for Special.\nAfter locking two balls in the U.N. Orion space ship, start Multi-Ball\nplay by shooting the Transporter.\nDuring multi-ball the playfield values are tripled or doubled as indicated\nby the playfield lights just above the flippers. Unfortunately these\ndon't stay lit according to how many balls are in play and the bonuses\nare not multiplied at all. Multi-ball starts with the ball\npopper ejecting the first ball to the transporter flipper allowing a chance\nto increase the X-cellerator target value. Next the two balls in\nU.N. Orion space station are ejected one at a time giving you two more\nchances to run the X-cellerator value up to a Million. Be careful\nas focusing on the Transporter is a good way to drain. The operator can\nset the value of the Special to award points or an extra ball, as the special\nis lit by going through the space station during multi-ball.\nX-cellerator/U.N. Orion Super Bonus:\nEntering the U.N. Orion space station lights the three green arrows\nand a red arrow tip that point to the X-cellerator target. The lamp\ntable in the instruction manual calls these the Super Bonus lamps, so that's\nwhat I call it. They strobe at about once per second giving the impression\nthat shooting the X-cellerator at the proper moment will award from 10K\nto 40k in additional points; however, I've never seen points added to the\nscore in this manner. In general the Super Bonus scoring is an enigma.\nIt can reach 1M by multiple successive shots up the ramp, or sit around\nat 20K. The Super Bonus scoring is altered when the X-cellerator\nscore in lit by the in-lane.\n\nTechniques\n\nThe designers added the middle bumper post between the flippers to enable\nshots from either side of the playfield. When the ball has enough\nspeed in the in-lane just let it roll down the flipper, hit the center\npost, and then bounce up to the other flipper. Care must be used\nto avoid draining as its not always a sure thing. This is especially\nobvious since the right in-lane also lights the Spinner \"Double Score\"\nlamp for only 5 seconds. To score you must change flipper sides.\nNote, the flippers are properly adjusted by inserting a toothpick into\nthe hole on the playfield located behind the tip of the flipper.\nHold the toothpick between the rubber ring and flipper. This technique\nholds the flipper position when tightening the bolt from underneath the\nplayfield.\nThe Transporter and Super Bonus should be run up to 1M by successive\nshots. For the Transporter,\none must learn to catch the ball with the left flipper to set up multiple\nshots to the transporter. This is done by timing your shot just right,\nso that the ball and flipper are moving together and no bounce occurs.\nEither release or engage (your preference) the flipper just as the ball\narrives. The Super Bonus just requires you to flip away.\nThe left U.N. Orion ramp (with no ball lock) feeds the ball back to the\nlower right flipper for multiple shots up the ramp, or try to collect what\nyou've earned at any time with an X-cellerator shot.\nThere are a many ways to shoot for the S-O-S lanes and perhaps having\nthe lane change feature enabled makes obtaining and Extra Ball too easy.\nNote that the operator can disable the lane change feature (adj. # 41)\nwhich make the S-O-S lanes more challenging. I believe this feature\nis there for good reason. In my mind doing so allows a return\nto the \"golden days\" of pinball where players skillfully nudged the machine\nin order to make the \"needed\" in-lanes. However, the in-lane targets\ndo not have a lot of bounce like the older designs. No problem, another\napproach is to get the jet bumpers involved. The jet bumpers are\nlocated in a \"classic\" position right below the in-lanes. It's fun\nto bump the machine to keep the jet bumpers active thereby increasing the\nodds that a bumper shot up an in-lane will occur. In addition there\nare THREE other ways to make the in-lane targets: 1. The spinner lane,\n2. A right flipper shot up the center in-lane (the extra-ball shot),\n3. A ball plunger shot after a locked ball. Other operator\ncontrolled features involving the in-lanes: Top Lane Memory is adj. #37,\nleave it on if you disable the lane change feature. The S-O-S\ncompletion for Extra Ball is adj. #4, and Tilt warnings adj. #10.\nSettings\nThe operator can control the following game features. Memory indicates\nthat the value is carried over from ball to ball.\n\n#31 Spinner On Value 3-5 K\n#32 Left Kickback enabled at beginning of each ball\n#33 Transporter Bonus Values Memory\n#34 Special Memory\n#35 RESCUE Memory\n#36 Transporter countdown time 10 or 15 seconds\n#37 SOS lane Memory\n#38 Extra Ball Memory\n#39 Jackpot advance 1-9K\n#40 Easy Lock, Return lanes advance ball lock RESCUE\n#41 SOS Lane Change, Flipper activates rotation of lights\n#42 Consolidation Extra Ball\n#43 Extra Ball percentage\n#44 Extra Ball On, 4X, 5X etc SOS lanes\n#45 X-cellerator Memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Transporter: The Rescue", "manufacturer": "Bally/Midway", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/transporter.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Transporter: The Rescue", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Another Rules\nSheet for Twilight Zone has been written by Bowen Kerins, who can be reached\nas bowen@cardinal.stanford.edu.\n\nThis sheet is written and maintained by Kevin Martin, sigma@mcs.com.\nIf you have any questions or comments or additions or corrections, send\n'em along to me.\n\nTwilight Zone the pinball machine is the property of Williams/Bally, and a\ntrademark of the licensor.  The author(s) disclaim all interest in any\ntrademarks or other intellectual property referenced herein.\n\nI use the abbreviations \"K\" for a thousand points, \"M\" for a million points,\n\"B\" for a billion points, and \"LITZ\" for Lost In The Zone.\n\nThis version of the Guide should be considered final.\n\nImportant Things\nThis is a glossary of the shots and features that will be referred to during\nthe discussion of the game.  Because Twilight Zone is a rather cluttered\nwidebody design, this section is quite lengthy.  The features are, in\ngeneral, described starting from the lower right and proceeding\ncounter-clockwise.\n\n\n Flippers \nThere are four flippers - the usual two lower ones (full-length),\na second full-length right flipper less than halfway up the playfield, and\na much shorter flipper high on the left side of the playfield.  Two-stage\naction is provided for both sets of flippers.  The computer has control of\nthe flippers, but this is only used for ball searches.\n Manual Plunger \nThis is a normal plunger.  Its lane is fairly short and\nleads to a gate, beyond which there are three rollover switches for the\nSkill Shot.\n Automatic Plunger \nThis kicker is beneath the ball trough eject and has its\nown plunger lane to the left of the normal plunger lane.  A small rotating\ndiverter guides balls ejected from the trough into either the manual\nplunger lane or the automatic plunger.  The automatic plunger lane fires\nthe ball through a gate and onto the playfield such that it should complete\nthe Right Orbit.\n Skill Shot Rollovers \nThese are three rollover switches at the end of the\nmanual plunger lane, between the gate and a scoop that feeds the ball to\nthe Slot Machine kickout.  The lowest switch is the Red Zone, the middle\nis the Orange Zone, and the highest is the Yellow Zone.\n Right Orbit \nThis lane leads past the upper right flipper around the back\nof the playfield to the upper left flipper, exiting down the Left Orbit.\nThe automatic plunger fires the ball around the Right Orbit (hopefully).\nWhen Gumball is lit, the Right Orbit is used to load the Gumball Machine.\nWhen the Right Spiral is lit, shooting the Right Orbit collects it.  There\nis a Spiral Helper magnet on the Right Orbit, near the back of the\nplayfield.  There is a red light on a sign above the upper right flipper,\nindicating when Gumball is lit.  The Orbit itself has a large white\ntriangle indicating when Powerball Loop is lit, and beyond that there is a\nsmaller orange triangle indicating when the Right Spiral is lit.\n Slot Machine \nThis scoop is just above the upper right flipper and just to\nthe left of the Right Orbit.  It is protected on the right by a rubber\npost, and on the left by a narrow Greed Target.  This is the most\nfrequently used kickout in Twilight Zone, and ejected balls should come\ndirectly to the middle of the lower right flipper, if properly adjusted.\nA yellow light above and to the right of the scoop indicates when the Slot\nMachine is available.\n Hidden Lane \nThis is a narrow passageway behind the Slot Machine.  Balls\nwhich pass through here should feed neatly to the upper right flipper.\n Power Payoff \nThese are two red round standup targets above the Hidden Lane\nand at the bottom of the Player Piano entrance.  No distinction is made\nbetween the two targets.  A lightning bolt light in front of these targets\nindicates when they are lit.\n Player Piano \nThis is a sinkhole that faces left directly towards the upper\nleft flipper.  There is a round Greed Target above it and a rubber post\nbelow it, just above the Power Payoff targets.  There is a yellow light\nabove the sinkhole, indicating when the Player Piano is available.  There\nis also a red light which indicates that a Jackpot is lit at the Player\nPiano.\n Clock \nThis cube-shaped plastic Clock is mounted above the Player Piano.\nIn Attract Mode, it can indicate the current time.  During gameplay, it\ncounts down timers for various rounds and modes, and is used in special\nways in some rounds.  On older machines, the Clock is rather plain and\nwhite; newer machines have a much more colorful Clock.\n Lock Lane \nThis Lane is above the Player Piano and has a narrow line of\nsight to the lower left flipper.  The Lane turns tightly to feed to a\nstack of locked balls, and unfortunately this causes balls to sometimes\nmysteriously bounce out of the Lock and directly towards the center drain.\nThere is a amber light here to indicate when an Extra Ball is lit, and a\norange light to indicate when a Lock is lit (older machines have a green\nLock light).  Balls are kicked out of the Lock at the Right Spiral Helper,\nsuch that they come down the Right Orbit to the upper right flipper.\n Right Ramp \nThis is a short metal ramp to the left of the Lock Lane.  It\nleads steeply to a tight turn behind the Clock, where it feeds a habitrail\nthat leads to the Bridge Diverter above the upper left flipper.  Beyond the\nBridge Diverter, the habitrail feeds into the left side of the Powerfield.\nThe Right Ramp uses an opto switch behind the Clock; there is no sensor in\nthe Bridge Diverter itself.  There is an orange light at the entrance to\nthe Right Ramp, indicating when Battle The Power is lit or the Powerfield\nis available for any other reason.\n Clock Target \nThis is a small green standup target between the Left and\nRight Ramps.  There is a round white light in front of it, indicating when\nthe Clock Target is lit for any reason.  There are several modes which make\nspecial use of the Clock Target.\n Left Ramp \nThis is a shallow plastic ramp to the left of the Clock Target\nand to the right of the Left Orbit.  It has a swinging gate and sensor at\nits entrance, and uses a roll-under switch in the back right corner of the\nmachine to register a completed Ramp shot.  There is a diverter further\nalong the Ramp which is normally in an extended position.  Normally, balls\nfeed to a habitrail which crosses the entire playfield and deposits them in\nthe innermost Left Inlane.  When the diverter is retracted, balls are fed\ninto the automatic plunger lane, where they may fall into the automatic\nplunger or to the manual plunger, depending on the situation.  There are\nthree lamps in front of the Left Ramp.  The lowest lamp is orange and\nindicates that the Super Skill Shot is available.  The middle lamp is white\nand indicates that the Left Ramp will start Multiball.  The highest lamp is\nwhite and indicates that the Left Ramp will award Bonus X and two Robots\nrather than one.\n Left Orbit \nThis is a narrow and short lane above the upper left flipper,\nleading around the back of the playfield and down the Right Orbit to the\nupper right flipper.  When the Left Spiral is lit, shooting the Left Orbit\ncollects it.  There is a Spiral Helper magnet on the Left Orbit, just above\nthe Bridge Diverter.  There is a yellow light on the corner of the\nPowerfield next to the Bridge Diverter, indicating when the Left Spiral is\nlit.  The Orbit itself has a large white triangle indicating when Powerball\nLoop is lit.\n Bridge Diverter \nThis is a metal cage on the habitrail that is fed by the\nRight Ramp.  When the Powerfield is not available, balls are caught by the\nBridge Diverter and dropped onto the playfield above the upper left\nflipper.\n Gumball Machine \nThe Gumball Machine is in the far upper left corner of the\nplayfield.  It should normally hold three of the six balls installed in\nthe machine.  Balls are loaded into the Gumball Machine by a vertical\nkicker (known as the Gumball Popper) that is fed by the Right Orbit when\nthe Gumball Diverter is active.  Balls are fed out of the Gumball Machine\none at a time, where they roll over a switch and fall into the Camera\nsinkhole.\n Camera \nThis is a large sinkhole behind the upper left flipper.  It is\nalmost impossible to reach without holding that flipper up.  The Camera\nfeeds into the Slot Machine kickout.\n Hitchhiker Lane \nThis lane is beneath the Camera shot and just above the\nJet Bumpers.  When completed, it feeds the ball into the Jet Bumpers.\n Powerfield \nThis is a raised mini-playfield to the left of the upper left\nflipper.  When the Powerfield is available, shoot the Right Ramp to reach\nit.  Balls enter the Powerfield from the upper left corner.  There are four\nscoring switches on the lower walls of the Powerfield, and an opto near\nthe upper exit.  In the lower corners are player-controlled magnets,\ncalled Magna-Flip(TM).  When a ball is on the active Powerfield, use the\nflipper buttons to control Magna-Flip(TM).  The upper exit feeds into the\nCamera sinkhole, and the lower exit drops the ball into the Jet Bumpers.\n Dead End \nThis is a small sinkhole above and to the left of the Jet\nBumpers, underneath the Powerfield.  It awards the Town Square or Dead\nEnd value, and feeds to the Slot Machine kickout.\n Jet Bumpers \nThese three Jet Bumpers are also known as Town Square.  They\nare arranged in the usual triangular fashion, but dangerously close to the\nLeft Outlane.  On early machines, there is a rubber bar preventing balls\nfrom going towards the Left Outlane directly from the Jet Bumpers, while\nencouraging balls towards the center drain.  This bar is not present on\nnewer machines.\n Left Outlane \nThe Left Outlane can be lit for Extra Ball.  There is an\nadjustable post above the left side of this Outlane.  The rubber post on\nthe right side is considerably lower than the Inlane posts.\n Far Left Inlane \nThis Inlane lights the Right Spiral during normal play.\n Near Left Inlane \nThis Inlane temporarily lights the Slot Machine if it is\nunlit.  The Left Ramp deposits the ball in this Inlane, on the switch.\n Slingshots \nNormal configuration.\n Right Inlane \nThis Inlane lights Dead End, the Left Spiral (during normal\nplay), and the Left Ramp.  The right side of the Inlane is a low metal rail\nwith no rubber.\n Right Outlane \nThe Right Outlane can be lit for Special.  There is an\nadjustable rubber post above the right side of this Outlane.\n Rocket \nThis is a catch area beneath the upper right flipper.  A successful\nSkill Shot deposits the ball here.  Whenever a ball lands in the Rocket,\nit is fired at high speed across the playfield, where it should go through\nthe Hitchhiker and into the Jet Bumpers.\n  Greed Targets \nThere are seven of these yellow standup targets\nscattered across the playfield.  A narrow one stands to the left of the\nSlot Machine.  Two stand along the left side of the Slot Machine, facing\nthe upper left flipper.  One stands above the Player Piano, facing the\nupper left flipper.  One stands at the bottom edge of the Hitchhiker,\nfacing the upper right flipper.  Another stands just below this, facing\nthe center drain.  The last stands above the Near Left Inlane, facing\nalong the left Slingshot towards the lower left flipper.\n Balls \nSix balls should be installed in Twilight Zone, with one of them\nbeing a white ceramic Powerball.  Early machines had seven balls installed,\nand newer machines may still have seven indicated in their manuals.  If the\nPowerball is missing, a menu adjustment provides full compensation.\n\n\nSkill Shot\nThe normal Skill Shot from the manual plunger lane is to plunge gently, such\nthat the ball trips one or more of the rollover switches, without landing in\nthe scoop at the end of the plunger lane.  Hitting the scoop feeds the ball\nto the Slot Machine kickout and scores 1M (plus 100K for the Slot Machine\nkickout itself).  Hitting the lowest rollover switch (Red) scores 2M and\nadvances one Jet Bumper (see \"Town Square\").  Hitting the middle rollover\nswitch (Orange) scores 5M and advances two Jet Bumpers.  Hitting the highest\nrollover switch (Yellow) scores 10M and advances three Jet Bumpers.  It is\npossible to hit the lowest rollover switch and have the ball fall back to the\nmanual plunger lane, in which case it is best to plunge the ball into the\nscoop.  Normal Skill Shots feed the ball to the Rocket, which should fire it\nthrough the Hitchhiker lane and into the Jet Bumpers.\n\nThe ball easily gets stuck under or in front of the gate at the bottom of the\nrollover switches.  A light tap on the side of the cabinet is the easiest way\nto handle this.\n\nGreed Targets\nThe seven Greed Targets in Twilight Zone are unlit at the beginning of each\nball.  During normal play, hitting the unlit Clock Target will light one of\nthe Greed Targets (starting from the lower left and working upwards).  These\ncan also be lit by a Camera Award or the Extra Ball Buy-In.  Hitting a lit\nGreed Target awards 5M and unlights that Target.  However, due to a bug in\nthe software, 10M is actually awarded whenever you see this \"5 Million\"\nanimation!  This is true through at least L-4 revisions, and applies\nregardless of how the target was lit.\n\nOnce per ball and only during normal play, hitting the unlit Clock Target\nwhen all seven Greed Targets are already lit will award a Clock Bonus of 10M,\nwith an excellent sound effect and animation.\n\nDuring Multiball modes, or when the 10M Clock Bonus has already been\ncollected and all seven Greed Targets are lit, hitting the unlit Clock Target\nwill generate a cuckoo noise.  This can be helpful by letting you know there\nis a ball in that area of the playfield during Multiball modes.\n\nThe Greed Targets can all be lit automatically by the Camera: Lite Greed\nTargets award, and are also used during the Door Panel Greed Round, during\nMultiball, and when the Gumball Machine is lit for Powerball Mania (see\n\"Powerball\").  When the Extra Ball Buy-In is used, all seven Greed Targets\nare automatically lit and the 10M Clock Bonus is immediately available.\n\nThese Targets are also referred to as the 5 Million Targets.\n\nClock\nThe Clock, if working properly, is used to count down various rounds and\nmodes (this is handled by software if the Clock is believed to be\nmalfunctioning).  In general, the most recently started round has control of\nthe Clock.  The most common use of the Clock is to count forward from noon\nto midnight at a moderate pace; the amount of time this requires represents\nthe duration of a typical round or mode.  A distinctive sound is made at the\nend of any such round or mode; there is a grace period during and briefly\nafter this sound for almost every such round or mode.\n\nNote that the Clock can only move forward or backwards in a normal fashion;\nits arms cannot be moved in any fashion other than the normal progression of\ntime in either direction.\n\nTown Square\nThe three Jet Bumpers form Town Square.  Town Square has a current value,\nwhich is normally reset to 7.5M at the beginning of each ball.  Unlit Jet\nBumpers advance the Town Square value by 100K.  Lit Jet Bumpers advance the\nvalue by 200K.  Flashing Jet Bumpers advance the value by 300K.  The normal\nSkill Shot awards advance one, two, or all three Jet Bumpers by one step,\nfrom unlit to lit to flashing.  Shooting the unlit Camera at any time will\nadvance one Jet Bumper.  When all three Jet Bumpers are flashing, the next\nunlit Camera shot will display \"Jets At Max\" and no further message will be\ndisplayed for the rest of the current ball.  At the beginning of each ball,\nall three Jet Bumpers are unlit.\n\nTo collect the current Town Square value, shoot the unlit Dead End sinkhole.\nDoing this when Dead End is lit collects double the Town Square value (see\n\"Dead End\").  The Camera: 3X Town Square award is worth three times the\ncurrent Town Square value.\n\nThe maximum Town Square value is 25M.  The Town Square value can only be\nheld over to the next ball by the Camera: Hold Town Square award; otherwise\nit is always reset to the starting value of 7.5M.\n\nEvery Jet Bumper hit rotates the currently flashing Door Panel clockwise.\nThis of course skips any Panels that are already lit.\n\nSee also \"Town Square Madness\".\n\nDead End\nThe Right Inlane (at any time) lights the Dead End sinkhole until it is\ncollected or the current ball ends.  The lit Dead End is worth double the\ncurrent Town Square value.  Lit Dead End shots are counted over the course of\nthe game.  On normal settings, an Extra Ball is lit when you collect the\nthird Dead End; this value is operator adjustable between two to seven.\n\nThe Dead End Extra Ball is normally temporary.  If you already have the\nmaximum number of Extra Balls stacked when you collect your third Dead End,\nno Extra Ball is lit from Dead End, then or in the future.  For details, see\n\"Extra Balls\".\n\nSee also \"Easter Eggs\".\n\nRobots\nThe number of Robots you collect is counted over the course of the game.  You\nbegin the game with one Robot.  The Left Ramp normally awards one Robot at\nany time.  The Lock Lane also always awards one Robot.  While the Left Ramp\nis temporarily lit by the Right Inlane, it will award two Robots.\n\nOn normal settings, a certain number of Robots will light an Extra Ball.\nThis value reflexes and is typically between 6 and 14 Robots.  A second Extra\nBall is normally lit at 45 Robots, and this value does not reflex.  See\n\"Extra Balls\".\n\nAfter you collect the 98th Robot, Robots are no longer counted, and every\nRobot is worth a Super Robot bonus of 5M.  The Right Inlane has no effect on\nthis award.\n\nAt every multiple of 10 Robots (8 on Easy settings), the Camera is lit.  Lit\nCameras are stacked.  See \"Camera\".\n\nSee also \"Easter Eggs\"\n\nCamera\nThe Camera is lit at every multiple of 10 Robots (8 on Easy settings), or by\nthe Camera Door Panel, which actually lights the Camera twice.  There are\neight possible Camera awards.  The next Camera award is determined randomly,\nexcept that the entire set of eight must be completed before any of the\nawards can be repeated.  Also, the same award will never appear twice in a\nrow.  The next award is randomly pre-determined and preserved between balls,\nplayers, games, and power cycles.  The next Camera award is part of the\nstatus report.  Also, whenever you collect a Camera award, the next Camera\naward is displayed.\n\nThe eight Camera awards are described in the following sections.\n\nSee also \"Tournament Mode\"\n\nCamera: 20,000,000\nThis is the simplest Camera award - just 20M, no questions asked.\n\nCamera: Hold Town Square\nThis award prevents the Town Square value from being reset at the beginning\nof the next ball.  This is the only way to do so.  It does not, technically\nspeaking, hold the Town Square value to its current value.\n\nCamera: 3X Town Square\nThis awards three times the current Town Square value, from a minimum of\n22.5M to a maximum of 75M.\n\nCamera: Lite Greed Targets\nThis award lights all of the Greed Targets for 5M each, as if the unlit Clock\nTarget had been hit the appropriate number of times.  If you have not\ncollected the 10M Clock Bonus on the current ball, this effectively lights\nthe Clock Target for that Bonus.\n\nSee also \"Greed Targets\"\n\nCamera: Clock 10 Millions\nThis award starts a timed round of normal length, using the Clock as the\ntimer if possible.  During this time, the Clock Target adds 10M to the Clock\nMillions Total, regardless of other modes or rounds.  Starting Clock 10\nMillions credits a base value of 10M to the Clock Millions Total.\n\nScoring at least six hits on the Clock Target during this round will award a\nspecial 20M Clock Damage Bonus (and animation) when the round ends, unless\nthe sixth hit was scored during the ending grace period.\n\nSee also \"Door Panel: Clock Millions\".\n\nCamera: 10 Hitchhikers\nThis award awards 10 Hitchhikers as if they had been collected normally,\nunless you already have 100 Hitchhikers.  Because Battle The Power is lit at\nevery multiple of 10 Hitchhikers, this will normally light Battle The Power\nas well.  If you have between 90 and 100 Hitchhikers, this award will set\nyour total to 100 Hitchhikers, never any higher.\n\nIf the Hitchhiker Door Panel has been awarded on the current ball, this\naward is worth an immediate 20M.\n\nSee also \"Hitchhikers\" and \"Door Panel: Hitchhiker\".\n\nCamera: Lite Outlanes\nThis award lights the Outlanes (see \"Lit Outlanes\").  If the Outlanes are\nalready lit, this award has no effect.  If they are partially lit, this\naward will reset them to normally lit.\n\nCamera: Collect Bonus\nThis award awards your current End-of-Ball Bonus exactly as if you had just\ndrained, except that there is no quote for a Bonus of 100M or more.  It does\nnot change or reset any part of your Bonus, however.  This is obviously the\nmost valuable award, if used properly.\n\nSee also \"End-of-Ball Bonus\".\n\nHitchhikers\nThe number of Hitchhikers you collect is counted over the course of the\ngame.  You begin the game with one Hitchhiker.  At all times except during\nLost In The Zone, the Hitchhiker Lane will award at least one Hitchhiker\n(Hitchhikers awarded during Lost In The Zone do not count towards your\nnormal total, although Robots do).  During normal play, hitting the\nHitchhiker Lane switch twice in very quick succession will only award one\nHitchhiker, on the correct assumption that the ball has tripped the switch\nonce in each direction and not fallen into the Jet Bumpers as it should.\nDuring Multiball modes, every trip of the switch awards a Hitchhiker.\nShooting the Left Orbit and then the Hitchhiker Lane within the next second\nor two will award a Triple Pickup, which is three Hitchhikers.  This is true\nduring all modes, including Lost In The Zone.\n\nAt the award of the third Hitchhiker and at every multiple of 10\nHitchhikers, Battle The Power is lit on the Right Ramp.  Lit Battle The\nPower's are stacked.  See \"Battle The Power\"\n\nAfter the Hitchhiker Door Panel has been awarded, every Hitchhiker for the\nrest of the current ball is worth 2M.  The Triple Pickup is then worth 6M.\nThe Camera 10 Hitchhikers award is then worth 20M.\n\nDuring Lost In The Zone, Hitchhikers are worth 2M towards the Lost In The\nZone Total.\n\nSee also \"Easter Eggs\"\n\nBattle The Power\nThere are many ways to light Battle The Power on the Right Ramp.  Battle The\nPower is lit at the third and every multiple of 10 Hitchhikers.  It is also\nlit by a Door Panel.  It is also lit by every other Spiral award.  It is\nalso lit by the Red award of the Super Skill Shot.  It can also be\nautomatically lit at the beginning of the game if this option has been set in\nthe menus.\n\nWhen Battle The Power is lit, the Bridge Diverter will move aside to let the\nball onto the Powerfield.  The Magna-Flip&tm flippers are then active.  You\nhave at least 10 seconds in which to attempt to defeat the Power, which is\ndone by magnetically propelling the ball through the upper exit from the\nPowerfield.  The Powerfield value starts at 5M, and is increased by all four\nscoring switches and the opto at the top of the Powerfield.  The value of\nthese switches starts at 500K.  After you first defeat the Power, the switch\nvalue is 750K for the rest of the game.  After the second defeat, the switch\nvalue is 1M.  The switch value goes no higher.  The opto at the upper exit of\nthe Powerfield counts as two switch closures for this purpose.\n\nDefeating the Power doubles the Powerfield value and awards the currently\nflashing Door Panel (and advances the flashing light as if you had hit the\nPlayer Piano), leaving the Player Piano in its current lit or unlit state\n(the Slot Machine will always be lit, because you just hit the Right Ramp).\n\nDefeating the Power also lights the Power Payoff targets for 10M.  This is\nnot stacked.\n\nThe cumulative Powerfield values are part of your Bonus, to no known\nmaximum.\n\nDefeating the Power is detected by the combination of tripping the upper\nplayfield opto followed by the Camera sensor in the next few seconds.  During\nPowerball Mania and Lost In The Zone, this provides a way to \"cheat\" Mania\nJackpots by shooting the Camera while a ball is on the Powerfield.\n\nNote that there is a grace period during which you can get a few more shots\nat defeating the Power before Magna-Flip&tm is truly disabled.  However, it\nis possible to defeat the Power so late that you will only be given credit\nfor shooting the Camera.\n\nAfter any use of the Powerfield, a special ball search takes place to try to\nmake sure that all balls have exited the Powerfield.  This special ball\nsearch pulses Magna-Flip&tm twice, and is of course only noticeable when a\nmetal ball has actually become stuck on the Powerfield.\n\nIf the Powerfield is not properly leveled, the ball will frequently become\nstuck in either corner.  The special ball search will then take effect.\nRegardless of what dislodges the ball, you cannot defeat the Power at this\npoint - a lucky shot through the upper exit will behave as if you had simply\nshot the Camera.\n\nSometimes after a Multiball mode has ended, the Battle The Power light will\nnot be lit even if Battle The Power is available.  I am not referring only to\nthe case in which the Powerball was involved in the previous Multiball and\nthe software is unsure where it now resides.  I am also at a loss to explain\nwhy the software sometimes stops balls on Spiral Helpers after a round such\nas Fast Lock.  Perhaps the Powerball was spuriously detected during the round\nand now the software would like to make sure it's not on the playfield.\n\nGumball\nSpell GUMBALL by hitting both ramps in normal play; the Left Ramp awards\nGUM and the Right Ramp awards BALL.  Spelling GUMBALL lights a Lock and\nthe Gumball Machine.  Lit Gumball Machines are stacked, but you cannot\nspell GUMBALL again until you have used the lit Lock or completed Multiball.\n\nSee also \"Combo Shots\"\n\nGumball Machine\nThe Gumball Machine can be lit by spelling GUMBALL or by the Lite Gumball\nDoor Panel.  When it is lit, shoot the Right Orbit during normal play to\nload the Gumball Machine.  The Gumball Diverter will activate and the ball\nwill be kicked into the Gumball Machine.  Another ball will then be fed from\nthe bottom of the Gumball Machine to the Slot Machine kickout by way of the\nCamera sinkhole.  In normal play, there should be three balls in the Gumball\nMachine, and typically one of them is the Powerball, such that every third\nload of the Gumball Machine will release the Powerball.\n\nLoading the Gumball Machine the first time in a game (for each player) is\nworth 15M, the second time is worth 20M, and all subsequent loads are worth\n25M.  These points are awarded immediately.\n\nNote that on newer ROMs, an automatic plunge (as from a ball saver) will not\nload the Gumball Machine (or start Powerball Mania).\n\nOlder machines lack a plastic piece in the Gumball Machine that keeps the\nballs stacked vertically.  In these machines, it is possible for the balls\nto rotate as a ball is fed out, such that one ball is never let out of the\nGumball Machine.  You should probably complain to your operator if you run\ninto this problem.\n\nPowerball\nThe Powerball is a ceramic ball much like a steel pinball.  It is very\nslightly lighter and very slightly larger.  It plays very differently from\na steel pinball partly for these reasons and partly because it tends to\nspin and bounce differently.  The Powerball is, of course, completely immune\nto magnets.\n\nThere are two Powerball Sensors (called Proximity Sensors) in Twilight Zone;\none is in the trough at the next ball to be served, and the other is just\nabove and to the left of the Slot Machine kickout, such that the Sensor is\ncrossed by balls coming from the Player Piano, Camera, Gumball Machine,\nPowerfield upper exit, and Dead End, but not by balls that enter the plunger\nlane scoop or the Slot Machine itself.\n\nWhen the Powerball is on the playfield during normal play and has been\ndetected by at least one of the Powerball Sensors, the Gumball Machine is\nlit for Powerball Mania, and the Greed Targets are flashing.  There is a\nPowerball Payoff value which always starts at a base of 10M.  The Greed\nTargets increase the Powerball Payoff value (by 5M each) while the Powerball\nis known to be the only ball on the playfield.  All game features which do\nnot involve the use of magnets are still available at this time.  Spiral\nHelper magnets are disabled and Battle The Power is temporarily unavailable,\nbut you may still collect Door Panels, spell GUMBALL, light and use Locks,\nstart Multiball, collect Combos, etc.\n\nWhenever the Powerball completes an Orbit, a Powerball Loop is awarded, which\nis worth an immediate 10M.  This can be done with the left Orbit when\nPowerball Mania is lit, or with either Orbit during any Multiball mode except\nPowerball Mania itself.\n\nShooting the Right Orbit to the Gumball Diverter awards the current Powerball\nPayoff value and starts Powerball Mania.  See \"Powerball Mania\".\n\nNote that on newer ROMs, an automatic plunge (as from a ball saver) will not\nstart Powerball Mania.\n\nIf the Powerball is missing from the machine, there is software compensation\nto simulate it.  When the Powerball is being simulated by software, the\n\"Powerball\" display is in reverse video.\n\nIf the Powerball has not been detected after a certain number of consecutive\nloads of the Gumball Machine (five or six?), it is simulated and Powerball\nMania begins immediately (there is no round in which to build up the Payoff\nvalue).  It is possible to encounter this form of compensation while the\nPowerball is resting in the trough (rather than truly missing), by using\nstacked Gumball's from previous spellings of GUMBALL.  This form of\ncompensation only happens when the Trough Proximity Sensor is faulty.\n\nThis simulation of the Powerball may also be dictated by a menu adjustment,\nwhich will cause the Powerball sensors to be ignored.  In this case, the\nPowerball is simulated for every second ball released from the Gumball\nMachine, and a normal Powerball Payoff round is available while Powerball\nMania is lit.\n\nNote that if the powerball is being simulated (normally as the result of a\nmenu adjustment), every other ball dispensed by the Gumball Machine for each\nplayer will be designated a Powerball.\n\nThe software attempts to deduce which ball is the Powerball by keeping track\nof which balls are not the Powerball, although it is difficult to make good\nuse of this knowledge.  The most helpful consequence of this is that the\nPowerball is kept track of in the Lock Lane even though there is no Proximity\nSensor there.  However, I have seen this lead to unusual behavior on some\nmachines, where a steel ball is released from the Lock and identified as the\nPowerball.\n\nThe software also keeps virtual track of where it thinks the Powerball is in\nthe Gumball Machine, as additional but not necessarily helpful verification\nthat the Machine and Proximity Sensors are working properly.\n\nPowerball Mania\nPowerball Mania can only be started by loading the Powerball into the\nGumball Machine when the game knows the Powerball is the only ball on the\nplayfield, or by every second load of the Gumball Machine when software\ncompensation is active as described under \"Powerball\".\n\nStarting Powerball Mania immediately awards the current Powerball Payoff\nvalue, which starts at 10M (5M on prototype ROMs) and is increased by the\nGreed Targets before Powerball Mania.  The Powerball is loaded back into the\nGumball Machine, one ball is fed from the Gumball Machine, and two other\nballs are put into play.  These other balls come from the Lock if possible,\notherwise from the trough by way of the automatic plunger.\n\nThe Clock counts down at the beginning of Powerball Mania.  Until it reaches\nthe end of its cycle, all targets credit 250K to the Powerball Mania Total,\nwhich is part of your End-of-Ball Bonus.  The Powerball Mania Total begins at\n5M.  The Clock never pauses when timing this initial Frenzy, even when all\nballs are out of play (that is, locked or being launched).\n\nThere is a short grace period at the beginning of Powerball Mania, during\nwhich balls that drain will be relaunched into play by the automatic plunger.\nIt is possible for all three balls to drain and be relaunched into play.\n\nDuring Powerball Mania, the Right Ramp is flashing for a special version of\nBattle The Power.  You can shoot any number of balls up the Right Ramp to\nenter the Powerfield, where Magna-Flip&tm is active while the real flippers\nare also active.  Each ball that enters the Powerfield resets the timer for\nMagna-Flip&tm.  The Powerfield switch value is always 750K during Powerball\nMania, and this is credited to your Powerball Mania Total.  Therefore, during\nthe initial Frenzy, Powerfield switches credit a total of 1M each to the\nPowerball Mania Total.\n\nDefeating the Power during Powerball Mania awards a Mania Jackpot, which is\nalways 50M.  This value is credited towards your Powerball Mania Total.\nAfter defeating the Power, the timer continues for any balls remaining on\nthe Powerfield, but the Right Ramp no longer feeds the Powerfield.  Hit the\nLeft Ramp to relight the Right Ramp to reach the Powerfield.  After each\nMania Jackpot, the Powerfield timer becomes shorter, to a minimum of roughly\nfour seconds.  This shorter timer applies to all subsequent Powerball\nManias.  It also seems that a very quick drain from the Powerfield will make\nthe next Powerfield timer more generous.\n\nYou can collect \"cheat\" Mania Jackpots during Powerball Mania by shooting the\nCamera after a ball has tripped the upper opto on the Powerfield.  This can\nbe used to collect several Mania Jackpots with only one ball on the\nPowerfield.\n\nIt is possible to defeat the Power twice in very quick succession, such that\nonly one ball will be detected and only one Mania Jackpot awarded.  This was\ncorrected in ROM revision L-4.  The corrected version also makes it easier to\n\"cheat\" multiple jackpots as a result.\n\nAs in all other Multiball modes, Door Panels, Combos, Spiral Values, and the\nCamera are unavailable during Powerball Mania.\n\nPowerball Mania ends when you drain at least two of the three balls in play.\n\nThe Low Line menu option applies to Powerball Mania.  This option disables\nthe upper flippers during this mode, which provides more power to the\nMagna-Flip&tm magnets.  These magnets invariably have less power while the\nflippers are active.\n\nLocks\nLocks are lit at the Lock Lane by spelling GUMBALL (see \"Gumball\").  Locks\ncannot be stacked, as you cannot spell GUMBALL until you have used the\ncurrently lit Lock.\n\nOn normal settings, only one Lock is needed to light the Left Ramp for the\nfirst Multiball, and the second and third Locks are effectively lit for free.\nFor the second Multiball, locking the second ball will leave the Lock Lane\nlit for the third Lock without spelling GUMBALL again.  Menu adjustments can\naffect these rules.  Specifically, it is possible to allow Multiball to be\nstarted from the Left Ramp after the first time, and to allow the third Lock\nto be lit for free after the second time.\n\nThe Super Skill Shot on the Left Ramp takes precedence over starting\nMultiball.  See \"Door Panel: Super Skill Shot\".\n\nLocking the third ball or hitting the Left Ramp when lit for Multiball\nimmediately starts Multiball.  Multiball cannot be started during any other\nMultiball mode or when the Fast Lock countdown is running.  However, it is\ncompatible with all other rounds.\n\nMultiball\nWhen Multiball starts, the Jackpot is immediately lit at the Player Piano.\nIts starting value is 15M if only one ball was locked before starting\nMultiball (this is normally only possible for the first Multiball); otherwise\nit starts at 40M.  On prototype ROMs, these values are each 5M less.\n\nDuring Multiball, the Greed Targets are always flashing, lit to increase the\nJackpot value by 5M each.  When a Greed Target is hit, it remains unlit until\nall seven Targets have been hit or until a Jackpot has been collected, which\nresets all seven Targets.  When all seven Targets have been hit and the\nJackpot has still not been collected, one Target is lit at a time, proceeding\nin order from the lower left set of three, to the far upper right, then from\ntop to bottom in the set of three at the Slot Machine.  The Jackpot can be\nincreased to a maximum of 255M by hitting the Greed Targets.\n\nGreed Targets which were lit by the unlit Clock Target during normal play\nbefore Multiball remain lit during all Multiball modes but this is unrelated\nto the Jackpot value.\n\nHit the Player Piano to collect the Jackpot.  This resets the Jackpot to its\nprevious base value plus 10M.  It also resets the Greed Targets and leaves\nthe Jackpot unlit.  Relight the Jackpot by shooting the Camera.  This\nsequence proceeds as long as at least two balls are in play.  There is a\ngrace period for shooting the Jackpot, during which a Door Panel will also be\nawarded from the Player Piano after the Jackpot animation (if the Player\nPiano is in fact lit).\n\nThe base Jackpot value will only increase five times.  This limits the base\nJackpot value to 65M or 90M, depending on how many balls were locked before\nstarting Multiball.\n\nDuring the Jackpot animation, no balls are kicked out from the Slot Machine\nor automatic plunger.\n\nSpiral Helpers will help you with both the Jackpot and Camera shots as\nappropriate, unless the Door Panel Spiral Round is running, in which case\nits rules take precedence (see \"Spiral Helpers\").  When the Jackpot is lit,\nthe left Spiral Helper is active.  When the Camera is lit to relight the\nJackpot, the right Spiral Helper is active.  Note that during Multiball, both\nSpiral Helpers will always be reachable from either Orbit.  When the Spiral\nHelpers are active (they can only be overridden by Spiral Breakthrus), a\ncompleted Orbit will be credited as a Powerball Loop for 10M, on the\nassumption that the Powerball completed an Orbit and was of course unaffected\nby the Spiral Helpers.\n\nThe Right Ramp will also neatly present the ball to the upper left flipper\nfor a shot at the Jackpot.  When the Right Ramp is hit and the Jackpot is\nlit, other kickouts will be delayed until you've been given a brief but\nclean shot at the Jackpot.  In fact, given a choice between dropping a ball\nfrom the Bridge Diverter and activating other kickouts, the Bridge Diverter\nwill take precedence regardless of whether the Jackpot is lit or not.  This\nis somewhat unfortunate.  However, when there is a ball in the Lock Lane or\non the Right Spiral Helper and the Camera is lit to relight the Jackpot, the\nSlot Machine kickout will be delayed until you've been given a very brief but\nclean shot at the Camera.\n\nShooting the Jackpot with the Powerball (if properly detected) will award\ndouble the Jackpot value.  This value is displayed as doubled without regard\nto internal 8-bit overflow, such that a 255M Jackpot becomes 254M when\ndoubled, 140M becomes 25M, etc.  This is merely a display error, however; the\ncorrect value is still added to your score.\n\nDouble Jackpots depend entirely on the Powerball Sensor at the Slot Machine;\nthey can be awarded even when the Powerball is obviously somewhere else.\nThis most commonly happens when a ball falls into the Slot Machine\nimmediately after a Jackpot registers; the software sees the ball at the Slot\nMachine before the intervening Proximity Sensor detects a metal ball, so it\nassumes that the Powerball passed from the Jackpot switch to the Slot Machine\nswitch.\n\nDouble Jackpots are not available when menu adjustments indicate that the\nPowerball is missing, because the Powerball Sensors are then categorically\nignored.\n\nThere is no grace period for relaunching balls during Multiball.  If you\ndrain two of the three balls without collecting any Jackpots, the Lock Lane\nwill be lit for a Multiball Restart for 15 seconds.  The Restart will resume\nMultiball as it was before, with the Jackpot value as it was before, although\nsubsequent Jackpots will progress as if Multiball had been started with only\none ball locked; that is, the second Jackpot is 25M, and the maximum base\nvalue is 65M.\n\nThere is no grace period on the Multiball Restart, even though the music runs\nfor a second or two after the timer expires.  There is, however, a lead-in\ngrace period.  That is, if the last thing you shot was the Lock Lane when the\nother balls drained, you may be given credit for the Restart immediately,\neven though the ball has already been ejected from the Lock Lane.  This is\nmuch appreciated.\n\nIn all Multiball modes (normal, Fast Lock, and Powerball Mania), Door Panels,\nCombos, Spiral Values, and the Camera are unavailable.  During the Multiball\nRestart period, the only difference is that Combos are available.\n\nMultiball ends when you drain at least two of the three balls in play, with\nthe exception of Multiball Restart as described above.\n\nSpiral Values\nSpiral Values are represented by a row of six lights directly above the\nlower flippers.  The Spiral Values are, in order:\n\n\n 2 Million\n 3 Million + Battle The Power\n 4 Million\n 5 Million + Battle The Power\n 10 Million\n Lite Extra Ball + 10 Million + Battle The Power\n\nAfter the last award, subsequent Spiral Values (until reset) alternate\nbetween 10 Million and 10 Million + Battle The Power.  On normal settings,\ncollecting the last award will reset the Spiral Values at the beginning of\nthe next ball, such that only the first award is flashing.\n\nOn normal settings, the first two lights are lit at the beginning of the\ngame, and the third light is flashing.  The flashing light represents the\nnext Spiral Value to be awarded.  Collect a Spiral Value by shooting a lit\nOrbit.  The Right Orbit is lit by the Far Left Inlane, while the Left Orbit\nis lit by the Right Inlane.  Also, shooting either Orbit when unlit will\nlight that Orbit.  Orbits only remain lit for a few seconds, and the timers\ndo not ever pause.  Shooting a lit Orbit does not leave it lit for an\nadditional Spiral Value.\n\nShooting an unlit Orbit does not light that Orbit for a Spiral Value if the\nSpiral Helper on the near side was active, as this would make Spiral Values\ntoo easy to collect under certain conditions (such as when the Camera is lit\nin normal play).  See \"Spiral Helpers\".\n\nNormally, the Extra Ball lit by the last Spiral Value is a temporary Extra\nBall.  See \"Extra Balls\".\n\nOn prototype machines, lighting Battle The Power was not part of the Spiral\nValues.\n\nHere's a truly bizarre case:  If the Right Spiral is lit and you shoot the\nLock Lane but the ball jumps leftwards and over the divider that separates\nthe Lock Lane from the Gumball Diverter sinkhole, the Gumball Machine will be\nloaded (with points awarded if the Gumball Machine was lit), and the next\nSpiral Value will be awarded as compensation!\n\nSpiral Helpers\nThe Spiral Helpers are magnets located on either Orbit.  These magnets are\ntriggered by accompanying opto sensors and activated when appropriate.  The\nexact conditions for each Spiral Helper to be active are complex, and this\nsection attempts to describe all possible situations.  Thanks go to Mark\nPhaedrus, phaedrus@halcyon.com, for the format of this explanation.  The\nconditions are listed below, with precedence from top to bottom.  If no\ninformation is presented for one Orbit under a given condition, that\ncondition does not affect Helpers on that Orbit shot.\n\nPowerball is known to be the only ball on the playfield (obvious case):\n\n  left Orbit: no Helper\n right Orbit: no Helper\n\n\nSpiral Round running, fourth and later Orbits for Spiral Breakthru:\n\n  left Orbit: no Helper\n right Orbit: no Helper\n\n\nLost In The Zone running:\n\n  left Orbit: no Helper\n right Orbit: no Helper\n\n\nGumball Machine lit for GUMBALL or Powerball Mania:\n\n right Orbit: no Helper\n\n\nAutomatic plunger during Multiball:\n\n right Orbit: no Helper (left Helper on slow balls if Jackpot lit)\n\n\nAutomatic plunger for ball saver:\n\n right Orbit: left Helper active if Right Spiral is lit, but right Helper\nis always disabled\n\n\nJackpot lit during Multiball:\n\n  left Orbit: left Helper\n right Orbit: left Helper\n\n\nCamera lit during Multiball:\n\n  left Orbit: right Helper\n right Orbit: right Helper\n\n\nTown Square Madness running:\n\n  left Orbit: right Helper\n right Orbit: right Helper\n\n\nCamera lit during normal play:\n\n  left Orbit: right Helper\n right Orbit: right Helper\n\n\nSpiral Round running, first Orbit:\n\n  left Orbit: left Helper\n right Orbit: right Helper\n\n\nSpiral Round running, second Orbit:\n\n  left Orbit: left Helper\n right Orbit: right Helper if first Orbit was on left\n right Orbit: left Helper if first Orbit was on right\n\n\nSpiral Round running, third Orbit:\n\n  left Orbit: right Helper\n right Orbit: right Helper if first two Orbits were on left\nleft Helper if Orbit has been made on right\n\n\nSpiral Value lit on left Orbit:\n\n  left Orbit: right Helper\n\n\nSpiral Value lit on right Orbit:\n\n right Orbit: left Helper\n\n\nNormal play:\n\n  left Orbit: no Helper\n right Orbit: no Helper\n\n\nNote that none of the Helper behaviors prevent the award of lit Spiral\nValues, although some cases make it easier to collect a Spiral Value.\nSpecifically, if a Spiral Helper is active on the near side of a lit Spiral,\ncredit is given for the entire Spiral shot when the ball reaches the near\nSpiral Helper, provided that the ball appears to reach that Spiral Helper\nbefore the opposite Helper.  For example, when the Camera is lit in normal\nplay, a weak Right Orbit shot can collect a lit Spiral Value by only reaching\nthe right Spiral Helper, rather than having to go all the way around to the\nleft Spiral Helper.\n\nCredit is given for the lit right Spiral whenever a ball is loaded into the\nGumball Machine.\n\nAlso, shooting the Left Orbit to the right Spiral Helper when Town Square\nMadness is running or the Camera is lit (in normal play) does not disallow\ncollecting the Triple Pickup by shooting the Hitchhiker Lane.\n\nWhen Spiral Helpers are lit during any Multiball mode and a ball completes an\nOrbit without being properly caught, a Powerball Loop will be awarded for\n10M, on the assumption that the Powerball has just rightfully ignored the\nSpiral Helper magnets.  Note that in order to detect legitimate Powerball\nLoops, the Spiral Helpers are enabled when the Powerball is known to be the\nonly ball in play.\n\nThe Spiral Round can be very confusing.  The basic idea is that the left\nSpiral Helper is used no more than twice and the right Spiral Helper is used\nno more than once.  When shooting an Orbit, if the near Spiral Helper is\nstill available according to these specifications, it will be activated;\notherwise, the far Spiral Helper will be activated.  After three Spirals have\nbeen collected, Helpers are deactivated for the remainder of the Spiral\nround.\n\nDuring the Spiral Round, loading the Gumball Machine behaves as if a normal\nright Orbit was completed, counting as one use of the right Helper if it had\nnot been used previously, otherwise counting as a use of the left Helper.\nAlso, a ball ejected from the Lock Lane can trip the right Helper and give\ncredit for a Spiral award if the right Helper had not yet been used.\n\nIf fewer than two Spirals have been collected during the Spiral Round and a\nball is automatically plunged, two Spiral values are awarded, one for each\nSpiral Helper.\n\nSimilarly, if the Powerball is used to complete an Orbit during the Spiral\nRound (before two Spirals have been collected), two Spiral awards will be\ngiven, plus the 10M Powerball Loop.  This is usually only possible on the\nleft loop when Powerball Mania is lit, although it could also theoretically\nbe done during Multiball if the autoplunger failed to collect more than one\nSpiral award automatically.\n\nIf the ball is launched from the automatic plunger when this is not expected\n(due to some hardware failure), the overrides described above for the\nautomatic plunger do not apply.  In particular, the ball can be launched\ndirectly onto the active Right Spiral Helper, which does a very impressive\njob of decelerating it.\n\nIn general, the right Spiral Helper gets more use than the left one.\n\nLit Outlanes\nThe Outlanes can be lit by a Camera award or by the Orange award of the\nSuper Skill Shot.  The Left Outlane lights for an Extra Ball (the only Extra\nBall which is not awarded from the Lock Lane), and the Right Outlane lights\nfor Special.  On normal settings, Outlanes are \"hard\", which means that only\none Outlane is lit at a time (starting with the left for Extra Ball), and the\nlit Outlane is steered by the slingshots.  Hitting either slingshot moves the\nlight to the opposite Outlane.  When one lit Outlane has been collected, the\nother will be lit on every second slingshot hit.\n\nStrangely, the light is also moved to the opposite Outlane when you collect\nan Extra Ball, either at the Lock Lane or from the Left Outlane itself.\n\nWhen the Outlanes are set to \"easy\", both Outlanes are lit at once and the\nslingshots and Lock Lane have no effect on the Outlanes.\n\nLighting the Outlanes when they are already lit has no effect unless one\nOutlane has already been collected, in which case the Outlanes are reset to\nnormally lit.  You cannot have both Outlanes simultaneously lit on the\ndefault \"hard\" settings.\n\nThe Door\nThe Door is arguably the most central feature of Twilight Zone.  The Door is\na large collection of lights in the lower middle of the playfield,\nrepresenting a grid of awards and progress towards Multiball.  The four large\nred lights indicate progress in spelling GUMBALL and locking balls.  The\nyellow lights on the perimeter of the Door represent Door Panels, which are\nawards and rounds described in later sections.  The small white Door handle\nrepresents Lost In The Zone, which also has its own section.\n\nOn normal settings, collecting the Yellow award from a normal skill shot\nwill spot the 10 Million Door Panel.  Menu adjustments also allow the free\nspotting of the Battle The Power and Lite Gumball Door Panels whenever that\naward has been accomplished in some other fashion.  These rather unusual\nsettings are intended to make it easier to reach Lost In The Zone by reducing\nthe number of times one must shoot the Player Piano or the Slot Machine or\ndefeat the Power.\n\nCollecting any Extra Ball disables the Lite Extra Ball Door Panel on the\ncurrent Door, regardless of settings.  Also, if you have the maximum number\nof Extra Balls stacked when you begin a new Door, the Lite Extra Ball Door\nPanel will be spotted.  See \"Extra Balls\".\n\nStarting Multiball makes many noisy references to the Door. See \"Quotes\".\n\nPlayer Piano\nDuring normal play and when lit (yellow light), the Player Piano awards the\ncurrently flashing Door Panel.  The flashing light then advances clockwise\nto the next available Door Panel (or to the Door Handle), and the Player\nPiano remains unlit unless Lost In The Zone is the next award.  The Player\nPiano is lit by the Left Ramp.  On normal settings, the Player Piano is\nautomatically lit at the beginning of each ball.  This is not true on hard\nsettings or for five ball play.\n\nDuring Multiball, the lit Player Piano (red light) awards the Jackpot.\n\nOdd Change\nWhen the Player Piano is unlit or unavailable because of a running Multiball\nmode, it awards Odd Change.  This is a random value between 10 and 9,999,990,\ninclusive.  The distribution of these values is certainly not even.  It seems\nmost likely that a random number of digits (two to seven) is selected and\nthen the digits are generated.  During Lost In The Zone, however, Odd Change\nvalues are always seven digits.\n\nAn Odd Change value of 10M is not possible.\n\nSlot Machine\nDuring normal play and when lit, the Slot Machine awards a random Door\nPanel.  If at all possible, this is not the currently flashing Door Panel or\nthe Lite Extra Ball Door Panel.  Unless the currently flashing Door Panel was\nawarded, the flashing light is not affected by this award.  The Slot Machine\nremains unlit until relit indefinitely by the Right Ramp or temporarily by\nthe Near Left Inlane.  On normal settings, the Slot Machine is automatically\nlit at the beginning of each ball.  On hard settings or for five ball play,\nthis is not the case.\n\nThe unlit Slot Machine awards 100K.\n\nHitting the Slot Machine immediately after a kickout from the Slot Machine\nawards nothing, on the assumption that the ball was not properly kicked out.\nThe timing for this is flawless and it should be impossible to hit the ball\nback in quickly enough to have a problem with this.\n\nThe Slot Machine tends to favor the weaker awards, such as 10 Million, Lite\nGumball, Battle The Power, and Super Slot.\n\nDoor Panels\nThere are fifteen Door Panels, counting the Handle.  During normal play, the\ncurrently flashing Door Panel is awarded by the lit Player Piano or by\ndefeating the Power, and a random Door Panel is awarded by the lit Slot\nMachine.  There is no other way to collect Door Panels.\n\nLit Door Panels have already been collected or spotted, and cannot be\ncollected again until after Lost In The Zone has been completed.  The\nflashing Door Panel is rotated clockwise by the Jet Bumpers.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, one of four Door Panels will be the currently\nflashing award: Town Square Madness, Clock Millions, Camera, or Clock Chaos.\nThis is not necessarily the same for each player in a multi-player game.\n\nThe Door Panels are described here in clockwise order, starting in the upper\nleft corner.\n\nDoor Panel: Town Square Madness\nThis is a timed round of normal length, during which all targets increase\nthe Town Square Madness Total, which is part of the End-of-Ball Bonus.\nStarting Town Square Madness credits 3M to the Town Square Madness Total.\nEvery switch in the game increases that Total by 350K.  Each hit of the Jet\nBumpers credits the current switch value and increases that switch value by\n25K.  The maximum switch value during Town Square Madness is 1M.\n\nWhen Town Square Madness is running, the right Spiral Helper will catch\nballs to allow a shot at the Hitchhiker Lane, subject to various conditions.\nSee \"Spiral Helpers\".\n\nDoor Panel: Lite Extra Ball\nThis award immediately lights an Extra Ball, provided that you do not\ncurrently have too many Extra Balls.  Collecting any Extra Ball will disable\nthis award on the current Door.  If Extra Balls have been completely disabled\nby menu adjustments, this Door Panel will always be lit and does not need to\nbe collected in order to reach Lost In The Zone.  If you begin a new Door and\nalready have the maximum number of Extra Balls stacked, this Door Panel will\nbe lit and unavailable.\n\nSee also \"Extra Balls\".\n\nDoor Panel: Super Slot\nThis is a timed round of normal length, during which the Slot Machine's\nyellow light is rapidly flashing, and the Slot Machine is worth a random\nvalue of 10M to 20M (by millions) in addition to its usual behavior.  These\npoints are awarded immediately.  In order to collect Door Panels from the\nSlot Machine during this round, you must light it in the usual fashion.\n\nDoor Panel: Clock Millions\nThis is a timed round of normal length, during which the Clock Target is\nworth the current position of the Clock's hour hand, in millions.  Because\nthe Clock runs from noon to midnight, this means that there is a brief\ninitial period during which the Clock Target is worth 12M.  Values awarded\nby the Clock Target are credited to the Clock Millions Total, which is part\nof the End-of-Ball Bonus.  Starting Clock Millions credits 5M to this Total.\nDuring the brief grace period, the Clock Target's value is 12M.  This grace\nperiod is actually long enough to hit the Clock Target twice.\n\nScoring at least six hits on the Clock Target during this round will award a\nspecial 10M Clock Damage Bonus (and animation) when the round ends, unless\nthe sixth hit was scored during the ending grace period.\n\nDoor Panel: The Spiral\nThis is a timed round of normal length, during which all Orbit shots are\nworth a special value in addition to normal behavior, and during which most\ntypical Spiral Helper behavior is overridden (for an exact description of\nbehavior, see \"Spiral Helpers\").  The first two Orbit shots are worth 10M\neach, the third is worth 15M, and all subsequent Orbit shots during this\nround award a Spiral Breakthru for 15M.  These points are awarded\nimmediately, in addition to other awards, and there is no grace period for\ncollecting these values.\n\nDoor Panel: Battle The Power\nThis Door Panel lights Battle The Power on the Right Ramp (these can be\nstacked).  If the Powerfield is currently unavailable (for example, the\nPowerball is on the playfield), lit Battle The Power's are remembered.\n\nThis Door Panel can be spotted by lighting Battle The Power in any other\nfashion, if the appropriate menu adjustment has been made.\n\nDoor Panel: 10 Million\nThis Door Panel immediately awards 10M.  Big Points ;-)\n\nThis Door Panel is spotted by the Yellow award from the normal skill shot on\nnormal settings.\n\nDoor Panel: Greed\nThis is a timed round of normal length, during which all seven Greed Targets\nare flashing.  In addition to their normal behavior, these Targets credit 5M\nto the Greed Total, which is part of the End-of-Ball Bonus.  Starting the\nGreed round credits 5M to this Total.  Hitting a flashing Target unlights it.\nWhen all seven Targets have been hit, all of the Targets will return to\nflashing status.\n\nA Greed Total of 25M or more will earn a familiar quote from Rod: \"There,\nsee what Greed will get you?\"\n\nDoor Panel: Camera\nThis Door Panel lights the Camera twice.  Lit Cameras are stacked, of course.\nSee \"Camera\".\n\nDoor Panel: Hitchhiker\nThis Door Panel awards an immediate 2M for each Hitchhiker that you\ncurrently have, and makes every Hitchhiker collected for the rest of the\ncurrent ball worth an immediate 2M (Triple Pickup awards 6M, Camera: 10\nHitchhikers awards 20M).  The points count down slowly at first but soon\nbecome gunfire.  Collecting this Door Panel twice on a single ball does not\nincrease this value, unfortunately.\n\nBecause the maximum number of Hitchhikers is 100, the maximum value of this\naward is a pleasant 200M.\n\nOn L-4 ROMs, the volume is turned down considerably during this award.\n\nDoor Panel: Clock Chaos\nThis is a timed round of potentially unlimited length.  A base of 5M is\ncredited to the Clock Chaos Total, which is part of your End-of-Ball Bonus.\nThe Clock winds itself to 6 o'clock and starts slowly winding backwards\ntowards noon.  Hitting the Clock Target credits the current value of the\nClock's hour hand in millions to the Clock Chaos Total, and reverses the\ndirection of the Clock's winding.  When this happens, the music (\"Pop Goes\nThe Weasel\") and the winding become faster.\n\nScoring at least six hits on the Clock Target during this round will get you\na special quote and adds 25M to the Clock Chaos Total; see \"Easter Eggs\".\n\nHitting the Clock Target during the grace period will credit 12M to the\nClock Chaos Total and resume the Clock Chaos round!  At least once, however,\nI have received a mysterious 63M towards my Clock Chaos Total for doing this.\n\nClock Chaos is undoubtedly the worst time for the physical Clock to be\ndisabled because the software believes it is malfunctioning.  It is much,\nmuch easier to read the current time and direction of time from the real\nClock than it is from the display, especially during Multiball modes.\n\nThe good news is that if the Clock is indeed working, Clock Chaos will always\ntake precedence over any other round that wants to use the Clock.\n\nDoor Panel: Super Skill Shot\nThis Door Panel lights the Left Ramp for the Super Skill Shot, which takes\nprecedence over Multiball on the Ramp.  Hitting the Left Ramp during normal\nplay (including when the Powerball is on the playfield) will divert the ball\ninto the manual plunger lane, where the Skill Shot Rollovers are lit for very\nattractive awards.\n\nFor the Super Skill Shot, all three awards and the scoop award 10M,\nregardless of skill.  The Red award lights Battle The Power (see \"Battle The\nPower\").  The Orange award lights the Outlanes (see \"Lit Outlanes\").  The\nYellow award lights a temporary Extra Ball (see \"Extra Balls\").  Missing\nsimply awards 10M and ejects the ball from the Slot Machine Kickout.\n\nSuper Skill Shots cannot be stacked.\n\nDoor Panel: Fast Lock\nThis is a timed round of normal length, during which a radio tunes itself\ndown from 17.3M to 5.3M before the round ends.  During this time, the Lock\nLane is lit to award the current value and start Fast Lock Multiball.  The\ngimmick here is that the sound effects, quotes, and music during this round\nand the (optional) ensuing Multiball correspond to previous games of Pat\nLawlor design.  These effects, quotes, and music are listed here in the order\nthey are presented during the round (with thanks and credit to Bowen Kerins,\nbowen@cardinal.stanford.edu):\n\n\n The Addams Family: Sounds of Cousin It mumbling.  When hit, Cousin It\nyelps.  During Multiball, Jackpot lit music from The Addams Family.\n Funhouse: Rudy says, \"Hey, it's only pinball!\"  When hit, Rudy says,\n\"Gulp... bleaagggh!\"  During Multiball, Jackpot lit music from Funhouse.\n Whirlwind: \"Return to your homes.\"  When hit, \"Do not panic.\"  During\nMultiball, post-Jackpot music from Whirlwind.\n Earthshaker: \"It's sunny drive time!\"  When hit, \"Ooh, gimme shelter!\"\nDuring Multiball, normal Earthshaker theme music.\n Banzai Run: \"Welcome race fans!\"  When hit, \"Go for the hill!\"  During\nMultiball, normal Banzai Run theme music.\n\n\nSometimes you will hear a spurious quote from a previous machine just as FasDuring Fast Lock Multiball, the Lock Lane is lit for the same value that was\ncollected at the beginning of the Multiball.  As in all other Multiball\nmodes, Door Panels, Combos, Spiral Values, the Camera, and other Multiball\nmodes are unavailable during Fast Lock Multiball.  Strangely enough, however,\nthe Lock Lane will no longer award Robots during this round.\n\nFast Lock Multiball ends when you drain at least two of the three balls in\nplay.  There is no grace period at all for relaunching balls.  However, there\nis a brief grace period for collecting one last Fast Lock value.\n\nDoor Panel: Lite Gumball\nThis Door Panel lights the Gumball Machine on the Right Orbit (these can be\nstacked).\n\nThis Door Panel can be spotted by lighting the Gumball Machine in the usual\nfashion (by spelling GUMBALL), if the appropriate menu adjustment has been\nmade.\n\nLost In The Zone\nThe last Door Panel is the Handle.  When the Handle is flashing, the Player\nPiano and Slot Machine should automatically be lit (although there are some\nstrange cases on machines that do not automatically relight both at the\nbeginning of each ball).  The Handle can also be awarded by defeating the\nPower during Battle The Power.\n\nThe Door Handle awards Lost In The Zone.  This is a slow timed round (total\nduration is 45 seconds) during which almost every playfield feature is active\nand all six balls are kept in play by the automatic plunger (the Gumball\nMachine is emptied at the beginning of the round).  During this round:\n\n\n Clock Millions is running, adding to the current Clock Millions Total.\n Town Square Madness is running, adding to the current Town Square\nMadness Total.  However, only the Jet Bumpers appear to award the\ncurrent switch value, as typical Town Square Madness values are\nimpossibly low.\n Powerball Mania is running, adding to the current Powerball Mania Total.\nThis means that the Powerfield is lit and defeating the Power is worth\n50M.  The Left Ramp relights the Right Ramp to reach the Powerfield.  The\ndetection of Mania Jackpots seems to be extremely forgiving during Lost\nIn The Zone, and shooting the Camera while a ball is on the Powerfield\nalmost guarantees that you will receive credit for a Mania Jackpot.\n The Greed round is running, with all seven Greed Targets flashing all of\nthe time.  This adds to the current Greed Total.\n Odd Change is always lit at the Player Piano and is always a seven digit\nvalue.  An Odd Change Total is tracked, with an initial value of 10M.\n Super Slot is always lit at the Slot Machine.  A Super Slot Total is\ntracked, which has an initial value of 20M.\n Hitchhikers are worth 2M, but are not remembered after Lost In The Zone\nends (that is to say, they are not added to your running total).  You\nare given credit for 5 Hitchhikers at the start of LITZ, guaranteeing a\ntotal of at least 10M.\n Dead End behaves normally, although the screen indicates that it \"is\nlit\".  You must still light and relight Dead End as in normal play.\n The Left Ramp is worth 10M (and Extra Balls can be lit by Robots).\n\n\nWhen the round ends, the flippers go dead and your Lost In The Zone Total is\ncomputed:\n\n\n 2M per Hitchhiker collected during LITZ\n Odd Change Total\n Super Slot Total\n Town Square Madness Total (includes total from current ball)\n Greed Total (includes total from current ball)\n Clock Millions Total (includes total from current ball)\n Powerball Mania (includes total from current ball)\n 10M per Left Ramp collected during this round\n\n\nAll values which are part of the Lost In The Zone Total are reset to zero.\nThe only values which will remain for your current End-Of-Ball Bonus (other\nthan the base) are Clock Chaos and Powerfield.\n\nWhile this total is being computed, the automatic plunger attempts to reload\nthe Gumball Machine.\n\nWith the exception of Fast Lock, rounds that are running at the beginning of\nLost In The Zone continue to run throughout the round.  This is especially\nnice in certain cases:\n\n\n Camera: Clock 10 Millions will greatly improve your Clock Millions\nTotal, as many balls will be hitting the Clock Target.\n Door Panel: Spiral will award numerous Spiral Breakthrus at 15M each,\nalthough these do not count towards the Lost In The Zone Total.\n Clock Chaos is also handy but does not count towards the Total.\n\n\nHowever, rounds which are automatically started as part of Lost In The Zone\ndo not run twice, so to speak, if they are running when Lost In The Zone is\nstarted.  It is better to maximize the points from that round before starting\nLost In The Zone, as those points will then go towards your Lost In The Zone\nTotal.\n\nCombos, Spiral Values, the Camera, and of course Door Panels are unavailable\nduring Lost In The Zone.  Lit Outlanes can be collected, however, as can lit\nExtra Balls from the Lock Lane.\n\nThe Town Square value is increased normally during Lost In The Zone (to its\nusual maximum of 25M), and the unlit Camera will advance a Jet Bumper if the\nJets are not at maximum.\n\nCollecting a Special from the lit Right Outlane during Lost In The Zone will\ndelay its animation until Lost In The Zone has ended.  Strangely, the\nanimation will display REPLAY rather than SPECIAL.\n\nExtra Balls\nThere are many ways to get Extra Balls in Twilight Zone, and there are some\nunusual interactions to be noted.  Almost all Extra Balls are lit at the Lock\nLane, and almost the only way to collect an Extra Ball is to shoot the Lock\nLane.  There are only two exceptions - see \"Extra Ball Buy-In\" and \"Lit\nOutlanes\".\n\nThe most obvious Extra Ball is lit by a Door Panel award.  However,\ncollecting any Extra Ball will disable this Panel on the current Door,\nrobbing you of one potential Extra Ball.  This cannot be prevented by any\nmenu adjustment.  Also, the Slot Machine will not give out the Lite Extra\nBall Door Panel unless it has no choice (which is an unlikely situation, to\nsay the least).\n\nAn Extra Ball is lit by Robots; typically between 6 and 14 Robots are\nrequired (this value reflexes).  Another Extra Ball is lit at 45 Robots.\n\nAll other Extra Balls are temporary; that is, if they are not collected on\nthe current ball, they will no longer be lit.  This also applies with the\nExtra Ball Buy-In; any temporary Extra Balls that are lit will disappear when\nyou use the Buy-In.\n\nThe sixth Spiral Value lights an Extra Ball.  This can only be achieved once\nper ball, and the Spiral Value is fully reset to the first award at the\nbeginning of every ball after lighting the Extra Ball in this fashion.\n\nThe left Outlane awards an Extra Ball when lit.  See \"Lit Outlanes\".\n\nA temporary Extra Ball is lit at a certain number of Dead Ends, typically 3,\nbut menu adjustable between 2 and 7, inclusive.\n\nThe Yellow award of the Super Skill Shot lights a temporary Extra Ball.\nThis is the only temporary Extra Ball which cannot be made permanent by any\nmenu adjustments.\n\nThere is normally a limit on the number of Extra Balls you can collect at\nany one time.  When you have reached this limit, no more Extra Balls will be\nlit; instead, they are simply skipped.  This is particularly rude when you\nconsider that most such Extra Balls cannot then be lit at some later time.\nThe normal limit is to allow no more than four Extra Balls to be collected at\nany one time.  If you do manage to light Extra Balls such that you can\ncollect more than four at once, you will still only have four Extra Balls,\nalthough the only way to verify this is by examining the Status Report (that\nis, the animations proceed normally).\n\nIf you have the maximum number of Extra Balls stacked when you complete Lost\nIn The Zone, the Lite Extra Ball Door Panel will be lit and therefore\nunavailable on the new Door.  If you have the maximum number of Extra Balls\nstacked when you hit the Super Skill Shot, the Yellow award will be only 10M.\nLighting Outlanes when you have the maximum number of Extra Balls stacked\nwill only light the right Outlane (on the default \"hard\" settings, this means\nit is lit only for every second slingshot hit).\n\nDuring Multiball modes, including Lost In The Zone, lighting an Extra Ball\nwhile a ball is being briefly held in the Lock Lane will award the Extra Ball\nimmediately.  Collecting an Extra Ball during Lost In The Zone does not\nnecessarily (but see above) spot the Lite Extra Ball Door Panel on the next\nDoor.\n\nCombo Shots\nMost of this information comes from Bowen Kerins and other netters, as I\nhave personally made limited use of Combo Shots in Twilight Zone.  There are\nplenty of these shots, however.\n\nThe only 2-way Combo is the Gum-Ball Combo, which is Left Ramp followed by\nRight Ramp, when neither GUM nor BALL has been spelled for the next Lock.\nThis is worth 5M and if Battle The Power is not lit, you can proceed to\n3-way or 4-way Combos.  It is possible (but extremely rare) to collect this\nCombo by shooting both ramps just as a Multiball mode ends, and find that\nonly BALL has been spelled.  This is very strange, of course.\n\nThese are the 3-way Combos, each worth 10M:\n\n\n Left Ramp -> Right Ramp -> Player Piano (regardless of GUMBALL)\n Left Ramp -> Lock Lane (unlit) -> Camera\n Left Ramp -> Lock Lane (unlit) -> Hitchhiker Lane\n\n\nThese are the 4-way Combos, each worth 20M:\n\n\n Left Ramp -> Right Ramp -> Hidden Lane -> Camera\n Left Ramp -> Right Ramp -> Hidden Lane -> Hitchhiker Lane\n Left Ramp -> Right Spiral (without Spiral Helpers) -> Hidden Lane ->\nHitchhiker Lane\n Left Ramp -> Right Spiral (without Spiral Helpers) -> Hidden Lane ->\nCamera\n\n\nThese Combos do not actually exist, but have been listed here previously in\nerror:\n\n\n Right Ramp -> Hidden Lane -> Camera\n Right Ramp -> Hidden Lane -> Hitchhiker Lane\n Left Ramp -> Right Spiral (with right Spiral Helper) -> Camera\n Left Ramp -> Right Spiral (with right Spiral Helper) -> Hitchhiker Lane\n\n\nNote that in non-prototype machines, there is no opto sensor in the Hidden\nLane (and even when present, such a sensor is ignored by newer software);\nCombos which involve the Hidden Lane can actually be scored without passing\nthrough it, usually through a very strange bounce.  However, a certain delay\nseems to be necessary in order to receive credit.  Also, Combos are sometimes\nmysteriously not awarded, for no apparent reason.  For the most part, hitting\nmiscellaneous targets while completing a Combo does not interfere with\ncollecting that Combo.\n\nCombo Shots are unavailable during all Multiball modes.  However, they are\navailable during the 15 second Multiball restart (except the Gumball Combo,\nof course).\n\nCollecting a Replay while the ball is sitting in the Bridge Diverter will\nprevent you from completing any Combos you were working on.\n\nBonus Multiplier\nThe Bonus Multiplier is increased by the Left Ramp when briefly lit by the\nRight Inlane.  It progresses to 2X, 3X, 4X, and a maximum of 5X.  This is\navailable at all times.  The Bonus Multiplier is never held over between\nballs.\n\nWhenever the Bonus Multiplier is increased, the Left Ramp also awards two\nRobots rather than one (unless, of course, you have reached Super Robots).\nAfter reaching 5X, the Left Ramp will only award one Robot.\n\nEnd-of-Ball Bonus\nEnd-of-Ball Bonus is the sum of many different things.  Some of these\nsubtotals are also part of the Lost In The Zone total, which resets such\nsubtotals to zero.  Your entire current End-of-Ball Bonus is awarded (but not\nreset) by the Camera: Collect Bonus award.\n\nThe base upon which End-of-Ball Bonus is built is:\n\n\n ((500K * Hitchhikers) + (500K * Door Panels)) * Bonus Multiplier\n\n\nThe subtotals from all appropriate rounds are then added to this base.  A\ngrand total of 100M or more earns a quote from Rod: \"Big risk, big reward...\nin the Twilight Zone\".  You can speed up the Bonus countdown by holding both\nflippers; doing so will also eliminate the quote.\n\nOther elements of the End-of-Ball Bonus are:\n\n Town Square Madness\n Clock Millions (includes Camera: Clock 10 Millions)\n Clock Chaos\n Greed\n Powerfield (normal Battle The Power play)\n Powerball Mania\n\n\nSee also \"Easter Eggs\".\n\nBall Savers\nBy default, there is no ball saver during the course of a normal game of\nTwilight Zone.  A ten second ball saver is enabled after the Extra Ball\nBuy-In, and a ball saver can be operator selected for up to fifteen seconds,\nbut only on the first ball of the game!  Both of these ball savers have\ntimers which run regardless of other activity, once the ball has been put\ninto play.  This is most unfortunate.\n\nThere is at least one ball saver as compensation for what the software\nbelieves to be failed hardware.  If a successful Skill Shot is made (this\nincludes the Super Skill Shot) and the ball does not land properly in the\nRocket Kicker and drains shortly thereafter, the ball will be autoplunged.\nThis can be relied upon if you're being tricky.\n\nNormally, a ball which is kicked out of the Slot Machine and drains without\nhitting anything is considered a true drain.  However, very rarely, the ball\nwill quietly be returned to the manual plunger lane, even though points have\nbeen scored.  I have also seen this happen at the end of Powerball Mania, for\nno apparent reason.\n\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\nMy tips, tricks, and strategies are presented in an order that roughly\ncorresponds to the order of analogous sections in the rest of the Rules\nSheet.  Think of this section as wholesale undiluted opinion and advice\nthat builds upon the mechanics and semantics described in other sections.\n\nIn my opinion, the foundation of Twilight Zone is its ramps, particularly the\nLeft Ramp.  The ramps are used to spell GUMBALL to light Locks and the\nGumball Machine, to light Extra Balls and the Camera, and to relight the\nPlayer Piano and Slot Machine.  They are also used to active special features\nsuch as Battle The Power and the Super Skill Shot.  Therefore, the second\nmost important shots to master in Twilight Zone are the two ramps, either of\nwhich you should be able to hit from either lower flipper.\n\nHowever, the most important \"shot\" to master is gaining control of a ball\ncoming from the Slot Machine kickout.  Unfortunately, this kickout is\ngenerally very inconsistent from machine to machine and, in fact, from minute\nto minute.  Your options include a drop catch, holding the right flipper up\n(which may also lead to a perfect bounce for a catch on the left on some\nmachines), or just letting the ball bounce over.  A particularly tricky\noption is to attempt to live catch the ball.  If the kickout is reasonable\nand reliable, I prefer to simply attack the ejected ball, shooting for either\nramp or the Left Orbit, whichever is appropriate at the time.\n\nThe most disagreeable shot is certainly the Lock Lane, because of its narrow\nsweet spot and its tendency to bounce back out towards the center drain even\nwhen hit fair and square.  Shooting the Slot Machine is tricky for similar\nreasons.  Most other shots in the game are, to varying degrees, easily\nmastered.\n\nMy first bit of advice for playing Twilight Zone is that in most cases the\nSkill Shot should be avoided.  The payoff is relatively slim, and because the\nball is automatically delivered into the Jet Bumpers afterwards, there is a\nsignificant risk of a quick left drain.  In fact, Pat Lawlor has been known\nto describe this design as \"not one of my shining moments as a designer\".\nIf a ball saver is active, it is quite reasonable to go for the Skill Shot.\nIn particular, collecting the Yellow Award has the benefit of spotting the\n10M Door Panel.  Also, it is important to master the manual plunger in order\nto reap the benefits of the Super Skill Shot.\n\nOne trick which is helpful with the Skill Shot and especially the Super Skill\nShot (because if you have collected the Super Yellow Award, it is essential\nto collect the lit Extra Ball as soon as possible) is shaking the ball out of\nthe Rocket Kicker.  If a nudge is given as the ball first lands in the\nKicker, a good bounce and a few additional nudges will encourage the ball to\nfall out of the Kicker and come to the lower right flipper.  This can be done\neven with fairly sensitive Tilt on the machine.  Doing this after a Skill\nShot has the added advantage of enabling a \"secret\" ball saver.  In fact, you\nmay want to purposely let the ball drain in order to have it autoplunged.\n\nYou can generally ignore the unlit Clock Target unless you see that all or\nnearly all of the Greed Targets are lit and you just can't resist going for\nthe 10M Clock Bonus.  Note that the 10M Clock Bonus is also lit for free when\nyou collect Camera: Lite Greed Targets or use the Extra Ball Buy-In.\n\nI generally ignore the Town Square value.  In the course of a good ball, it\nwill reach a high enough value to make Dead Ends and the Camera: 3X Town\nSquare award attractive, but it is too dangerous to shoot for Town Square\nspecifically.  The best exception to this is various Multiball modes,\nparticularly Fast Lock.  During these modes, it is slightly less dangerous to\nput the ball in the Jet Bumpers, simply because one quick drain won't\nnecessarily end the current ball.\n\nDead Ends are a lot of fun to shoot for, or at least some people think so.\nThe Dead End can become a very important shot towards the end of a very long\ngame, when Extra Balls are becoming very scarce.  Lost In The Zone can also\nbe a very good time to pick up Dead Ends, because it is always lit.  Note\nthat if you are playing on a fairly shallow but fast machine, the Jet Bumpers\nwill tend to knock the ball up into the Dead End sinkhole automatically,\nwhich is very pleasant, as it also provides a safe exit from the Jet Bumpers.\nActually, the Jet Bumpers can also knock the ball around the Dead End\nsinkhole and backwards down the Hitchhiker Lane!\n\nThe Dead End Bonus of 100M isn't necessarily worthwhile in terms of points,\nunless you find yourself very close to it, but it's awfully cool and worth\nseeing at least once if you get the chance.\n\nThe first Extra Ball lit by Robots reflexes (I've never seen it higher than\n14, but this proves nothing).  A high value for this can actually be a good\nthing, as it provides more time for you to try to collect the Lite Extra Ball\nDoor Panel before collecting (or better yet, lighting) any other Extra Balls.\nOf course, it also makes it harder to collect any Extra Ball other than the\none from the Door - that's the entire idea of reflexing, after all.\n\nI do not feel that Super Robots are especially worthwhile.  The 5M award was\nnoteworthy on The Addams Family (for Super Bear Bonus, which is clearly the\norigin of Super Robots), but not really in line with the scoring on Twilight\nZone.  But the real problem is that once you have reached Super Robots, the\nonly way to light the Camera is the Door Panel, which will usually only be\ncollected a very few times during the course of the game.  In a long game,\nthe Camera will eventually become unavailable and gameplay is at least\nslightly weakened as a result.\n\nWith a few exceptions, I try to collect all lit Camera awards as soon as\npossible.  If the award is fairly uninteresting (20M, Hold Town Square, 3X\nTown Square, for example), collect it in order to get it out of the way and\nsee what the next award is.  You may want to hold off a bit on the other\nawards, however.  Lite Greed Targets is sometimes almost completely unhelpful\n(for example, most or all of the Targets are already lit).  Clock 10 Millions\nis best when used in conjunction with Door Panel Clock Millions or any\nMultiball mode.  10 Hitchhikers will light Battle The Power; if it is\ncurrently unlit and you have a useful Door Panel lit at the Player Piano, you\nmay prefer to have the clean shot from the upper left flipper instead of\nhaving to defeat the Power.  Lite Outlanes is best for Multiball modes; in\nfact, lit Outlanes are sometimes the best reason for starting Multiball\nmodes, especially Fast Lock.\n\nAnd last and most notably, the Collect Bonus award from the Camera should not\nbe wasted.  Your End-Of-Ball Bonus can be well into the hundreds of millions.\nBattling the Power a few times or having a good Powerball Mania or a few more\nDoor Panels or even a better Bonus Multiplier will provide double rewards\nwhen you use the Collect Bonus award, and there's nothing as disappointing as\npicking up the Collect Bonus award at the beginning of a ball.\n\nHitchhikers are generally dangerous to shoot for, just because the Jet\nBumpers are dangerous.  The best time to pick up Hitchhikers is during\nMultiball modes, especially Fast Lock.  Triple Pickups are the most efficient\nway to pick up Hitchhikers, of course.  On many machines, a Triple Pickup can\nbe automatically collected by simply holding the upper right flipper up after\na fast Left Orbit shot.  Be careful, though - if this misses, you may find\nthe ball in the Right Outlane.  Whether or not this works is almost entirely\ndependent on the speed of the table, and to a lesser degree to its angle of\nsteepness.\n\nI highly recommend trying to pick up 100 Hitchhikers, just to say you've done\nit.  Collecting the Hitchhiker Door Panel with 100 Hitchhikers is\nparticularly thrilling.\n\nThere are many strategies for battling the Power.  The most important thing\nis to get the hang of flipping for just long enough to maximize the effect on\nthe ball.  Flipping too briefly will not impart enough velocity, while\nflipping for too long will slow the ball down on its path away from the\nmagnet.  The best way to practice this is to battle gently - flipping once\nand watching where the ball goes, then flipping again, and so on.  You may\nwish to adopt this \"gentle\" style for real battling, but its disadvantage is\nthat it does not build a very large Powerfield value at all.\n\nAnother strategy is to flip repeatedly with the Magna-Flip&tm that the ball\nis nearest, bouncing the ball off of the two nearest walls many times until\nit is eventually thrown free, hopefully finding its way to the upper exit.\nThis is not quite as haphazard as it sounds, once you learn when to recognize\nan escaping ball and stop flipping to give it a chance, and once you find the\nright frequency at which to flip.  This correct frequency varies according to\nmachine, Powerfield angle, and the speed (cleanliness) of the Powerfield\nsurface.  It seems to me that a faster surface requires a slower frequency,\nalthough I am at a loss to convincingly explain why.  It does certainly seem,\nhowever, that the worst thing to do when you're having trouble with the\nPowerfield is to flip as quickly as possible.  And you should never use both\nflippers at once!  Also, a small nudge with one solid shot will encourage the\nball towards the upper exit quite reliably.  You can, of course, Tilt while\nthe ball is on the Powerfield, though, so be careful.\n\nOne useful trick for battling the Power, which is dependent on how quickly\nthe ball is moving when it enters the Powerfield more than anything else, is\nto flip once with the right Magna-Flip&tm as the ball enters the Powerfield\nand drops past the right magnet.  With the appropriate timing, this can quite\noften throw the ball directly through the upper exit.\n\nOften when the ball goes through the upper exit of the Powerfield quickly, it\nwill roll up the Gumball exit lane and trip the Gumball Geneva switch.  This\nis harmless, as the software wisely ignores it.\n\nOver the course of the game, you can stack an amazing number of lit Gumball\nMachine shots if you concentrate on starting Multiball.  Be sure to cash in\non these shots at some point before the game ends.  At 25M each, this can add\nup nicely, and it's relatively easy points.  This is particularly tempting if\nthe Powerball is in the trough.  In fact, if you can safely let the ball from\nthe Slot Machine kickout bounce over to the left flipper for a quick shot at\nthe Right Orbit, every second load of the Gumball Machine will also collect a\nSpiral Value.\n\nDon't forget that you can also make good use of these lit Gumball Machine\nshots when you want a Powerball Mania - for example, to run up your Bonus\nbefore starting Lost In The Zone, in order to get a better total, or to get\nbetter use of the Collect Bonus award from the Camera.\n\nIn my opinion, there is usually only one reasonable thing to do with the\nPowerball, and that's to get rid of it as soon as possible.  If you're lucky,\nyou can let the Powerball bounce over after the Slot Machine kickout and\nyou'll get a nice easy shot at the Right Orbit from the lower left flipper.\nOtherwise, you'll have to make a trap or running shot from the lower right\nflipper (preferably at the Left Ramp) in order to get the Powerball to the\nlower left flipper.\n\nI avoid doing anything else with the Powerball because, on most machines, it\nis quite uncooperative, especially in the Bridge Diverter and the Lock Lane.\nThere are also problems arising from airballs, the worst of which send the\nball from the upper playfield directly to the Left Outlane, below the sensor.\n\nThe only other reasonable thing to do with the Powerball would be to lock it\n(if the Powerball has any chance of staying in the Lock Lane on your machine;\nit may be too fast to avoid bouncing out) or shoot the Left Ramp to start\nMultiball.  This is only useful because collecting a Multiball Jackpot with\nthe Powerball doubles its value.  Otherwise, the Powerball is still difficult\nto control and of course immune to the Spiral Helper magnets.\n\nSome have suggested that when you have the Powerball on the table, you can\njust shoot for Powerball Loops instead of starting Powerball Mania.  Needless\nto say, I don't recommend this.  In fact, I recommend ignoring Powerball\nLoops except for one case - if you have the Powerball on the lower left\nflipper during Multiball with the Jackpot lit, a Right Orbit shot isn't a bad\nidea at all.\n\nPowerball Mania can be quite lucrative with a little luck and a reasonable\namount of skill.  The most important thing is being able to shoot the Right\nRamp from either lower flipper at almost any time.  Keep as many balls on the\nPowerfield as possible, and never try to hold other balls on the flippers\nwhile you are trying to use Magna-Flip&tm.\n\nYour strategy for defeating the Power during Powerball Mania should be the\nsame as during a normal battle, except that Magna-Flip&tm will be at least\nslightly weaker and this makes the battle more difficult (but hopefully not\nimpossible).  The only other thing to watch out for, other than keeping the\nother balls in play of course, is the opportunity to collect a \"cheat\" Mania\nJackpot.  This is done by shooting the Camera during a few seconds after a\nball on the Powerfield has tripped the opto by the upper exit.  Such a\n\"cheat\" Mania Jackpot can be collected even after all balls have drained from\nthe Powerfield.  This trick also works with the Dead End sinkhole.  The\nstrangest case of all is when you fail to defeat the Power, but the Jet\nBumpers immediately knock the ball into the Dead End sinkhole and you are\ngiven the Mania Jackpot!\n\nI always try to lock two balls for the first Multiball.  It makes quite a\ndifference in the Jackpot values you will be collecting, especially if you\nonly get a couple of Jackpots.  But of course it's better to go ahead and\nhave a Multiball with low-value Jackpots than to drain while trying to lock\nthe second ball, so use your best judgment.\n\nMultiball is a lot of fun on Twilight Zone.  Obviously you want to pick up as\nmany Jackpots as possible, as quickly as possible.  This is actually easier\nwith only two balls in play, and as there is no real penalty for losing just\none ball, don't try too desperately to keep all three in play.\n\nIf any balls are being autoplunged at the start of Multiball, it's a very\ngood thing to collect the first Jackpot from one of those balls.  Since the\nSpiral Helper magnets will be disabled for the autoplunge, you'll have to get\nthe hang of a running shot at the Player Piano from the upper left flipper.\nThe most common problem with this shot is flipping too late.\n\nIf all of the balls are coming from the Lock or the autoplunge is not making\nit all the way around, you can either shoot the balls into the Camera (they\nshould then be ejected from the Slot Machine kickout one at a time), go for\nthe Hitchhiker Lane, or attempt a bounce shot into the Player Piano.  Such a\nbounce shot has the advantage that the next ball from the Lock can be put\ninto the Camera to relight the Jackpot immediately.\n\nThe easiest way to relight the Jackpot is to shoot the Right Orbit for the\nRight Spiral Helper to line up a shot at the Camera.  Shots at the Left Orbit\nor the Lock Lane are not unreasonable but are usually trickier.  You can also\nbackhand the Right Orbit from the lower right flipper, or even from the upper\nright flipper.\n\nWhen the Jackpot is lit and balls are being ejected from the Slot Machine\n(hopefully one at a time), you have three options for going after the\nJackpot.  One is a quick shot at the Left Orbit, where the ball will be\ncaught and the other kickouts delayed to allow a brief but clean shot at the\nJackpot.  You can also shoot for the Right Ramp with similar consequences.  I\nhappen to prefer the Left Orbit shot, although it's a bit tricky.  Your third\noption is any of a number of trick shots, bouncing the ball off of posts or\nGreed Targets or the Clock Target and into the Player Piano.\n\nYou can also, of course, shoot balls up the Left Ramp, which may be easier\nand more reliable.  From the lower left flipper, you can shoot the Right\nRamp, the Right Orbit, or go for a bounce shot into the Player Piano.\n\nIf the Spiral Round is running, you cannot rely on the Spiral Helper magnets.\nTo safely reach the Camera, use the Lock Lane.  To safely shoot the Jackpot,\nuse the Right Ramp.\n\nIn general, there are many options in Multiball, even though it is a\nrelatively simple mode.  I generally ignore the Greed Targets, as they are\nhit often enough by wandering balls (and tend to be quick drain shots\nbesides).  The only possible exception is the Greed Target directly above the\nPlayer Piano - you can hit this on your way into the Player Piano when\ncollecting the Jackpot.\n\nYou can shoot the lit Jackpot and the Camera at the same time, such that the\nJackpot is awarded but its red light never even flickers off.\n\nSometimes, if you shoot a ball into the Slot Machine right after shooting the\nJackpot, the machine will decide that you used the Powerball and will double\nthe Jackpot value accordingly, even though the Powerball is not even on the\ntable.\n\nDon't forget the grace period at the end of Multiball.  There is no better\ntime to go for a wild bounce shot into the Player Piano if the Jackpot was\nlit.  Also, if you see the other ball(s) draining and the Jackpot is lit,\nshoot for the Right Ramp immediately if at all possible.\n\nKeep an eye on the Spiral Values.  Usually, if you haven't yet collected an\nExtra Ball from the Spiral Values, you should shoot for any lit Orbits that\npresent themselves, especially the Right Orbit.  After the Spiral Values have\nreset, however, it's difficult to get interested in trying to collect all six\nof them in the course of one ball, although it's by no means impossible.\n\nLearn most of the cases for Spiral Helper behavior so that you'll never be\ncaught by surprise.  Unfortunately, there are some cases that are completely\ninexplicable.  For example, I have found one or both Spiral Helper magnets\nfully active throughout a Powerball Mania or Fast Lock mode, for no reason at\nall.  When this happens (it is thankfully rare), you cannot help but be\nsurprised.\n\nWhen the Outlanes are lit (assuming they are on the default \"hard\" settings),\nI prefer to keep the left Outlane lit whenever possible.  Also, when the left\nOutlane is indeed lit, shots to the Hitchhiker Lane are much safer, as is the\nSkill Shot.\n\nIf you can do Bang Backs and/or Death Saves, you may want to go ahead and\npick up lit Outlanes as soon as possible (fearing a center drain).\nOtherwise, the best thing to do is start a Multiball mode.  This is the best\nuse of Fast Lock, for example.  The best case is Powerball Mania, during\nwhich you can quickly side drain a couple of balls and actually get them back\nat no penalty whatsoever.\n\nThe most reliable way to collect Door Panels, in my opinion, is by shooting\nthe Player Piano from the upper left flipper.  Mastery of this shot is\nextremely helpful for progressing towards Lost In The Zone and for\ncontrolling the flow of your game in general.  If you are having trouble with\nthis shot, try leaning over the machine and watching the ball very carefully.\nThe ball should travel along the bright yellow path drawn from the upper left\nflipper into the Player Piano.  Remember, if the ball is going above the\nPlayer Piano, you're flipping too early, and if it is going below, you're\nflipping too late.  Simply adjust your timing accordingly.  Also, the timing\nis dependent on the speed of the ball.  This is obvious for autoplunged balls\nsuch as you will encounter in Multiball, but the trickier case is a ball\nwhich rolls up in front of the upper left flipper and is moving more slowly\nthan normal.\n\nIf the Player Piano switch is flaky on your machine, you can sometimes\nreceive credit for shooting the Slot Machine by hitting the Player Piano.\nThe disadvantages of this are obvious, but it can sometimes be helpful - if,\nfor example, the Player Piano is currently unlit.\n\nThe Slot Machine may be a relatively easy shot on your machine, or more\nlikely it's quite tricky.  You'll fare better if you aim very slightly to the\nright of the scoop, where the post can help guide the ball in.  On the left\nside, the narrow Greed Target is less helpful, and, as it is slowly bent\nbackwards by repeated attacks from fast moving balls, it tends to form a\nsmall ramp that encourages airballs from missed Slot Machine shots.\n\nDon't forget that defeating the Power awards Door Panels as well, and if you\nbattle the Power when something especially attractive is lit on the Door,\nsuch as Lite Extra Ball, there's the added pressure that failing to defeat\nthe Power will drop the ball into the Jet Bumpers, changing the lit value to\nsomething less attractive.\n\nYou can ignore Odd Change.  However, don't forget that you can also shoot for\nthe Greed Target or the Power Payoff targets right next to the Player Piano\nif it is unlit.\n\nTown Square Madness never seems to pay off like it should, especially when\nyou consider that it's dangerous to shoot for the Jet Bumpers to increase the\nswitch value.  The best Town Square Madness Totals I've seen (70M or so) have\ncome during Multiball modes.\n\nIf you have a good opportunity, try to pick up the Lite Extra Ball Door Panel\nbefore you collect any Extra Balls.  In particular, if you start the game\nwith Town Square Madness as your flashing Door Panel, collect it, relight the\nPlayer Piano, and collect that as quickly as possible.  Note that the Lite\nExtra Ball Door Panel comes immediately after the Town Square Madness Door\nPanel, tempting you to shoot for the Jet Bumpers for a better Town Square\nMadness, thereby unselecting the Lite Extra Ball Door Panel.  This is exactly\nthe same reasoning behind the layout of The Addams Family Mansion, in which\nRaise The Dead is followed immediately by Light Extra Ball.\n\nIf you want to do anything with Super Slot, try to get in a rhythm of\nshooting the Left Ramp followed by the Slot Machine and repeating.  This will\ncollect Door Panels along with Super Slot values.\n\nWhen Clock Millions starts, try to hit the Clock Target once right away,\nunless you have something more interesting to shoot for (such as Multiball on\nthe Left Ramp).  If you don't hit the Clock Target during the brief initial\nperiod for 12M, it's not a worthwhile shot for a while.  Ignore it until it's\nworth more; a 3M shot at the Clock isn't worth losing control of the ball.\n\nI have become very fond of the Spiral round, although I cannot really explain\nwhy.  I particularly enjoy having a Multiball mode in conjunction with the\nSpiral round, and I try to collect as many Spiral Breakthrus as possible.\nThese are quick and relatively easy points, especially since they are awarded\nfor shots that you might be making normally, such as the Right Orbit for the\nlit Gumball Machine.\n\nOne particularly useful trick is to start the Spiral round right before Lost\nIn The Zone.  Almost every autoplunged ball will count as a Spiral Breakthru\nfor an immediate 15M!\n\nNote that the 10M Door Panel comes immediately after the Battle The Power\nDoor Panel, such that proceeding to defeat the Power immediately will only\nnet you 10M.\n\nI usually ignore the Greed round, much as I ignore the Greed Targets during\nMultiball.  Ball action will generally collect a few Targets for you with no\nadditional effort.  It's not too unreasonable to shoot at a few Targets in\nthe upper half of the playfield, though, if you get the chance.  Also, having\nGreed running during Multiball will make the Greed Targets even more\nattractive than usual.\n\nDon't worry about collecting the Hitchhiker Door Panel even when you have few\nHitchhikers.  It takes a while to build up a significant number of\nHitchhikers, and any you collect on the current ball will still be worth the\n2M bonus after you collect this Door Panel.  Of course, if you're towards the\nend of a long game and have quite a few Hitchhikers, this Door Panel is very\ntempting - go for it!\n\nClock Chaos is another of my favorite rounds in Twilight Zone.  Since the\nClock first winds in reverse, it's best to shoot for the Clock Target as soon\nas possible.  Early in this round, you'll want to hit the Clock Target while\nit's on the later (ie, more valuable) times, but eventually you'll have very\nlittle time in either direction, so you'll want to hit the Clock Target while\nthe Clock is close to finishing on the side it's headed towards.  In any\ncase, don't forget about the grace period - not only does it provide you with\n12M, it restarts the round!\n\nOne other useful thing to remember about Clock Chaos is that the Clock pauses\nwhile certain things are happening, such as collecting a Jackpot during\nMultiball.  During this time, you can pick up several Clock Target values\nsafely.  Of course, you should try to remember which way the Clock will\nresume winding after you score these \"free\" hits.\n\nThe Super Skill Shot can be quite frustrating.  You can hardly avoid having\nto eventually use it once it's lit - only Multiball modes prevent the Left\nRamp from diverting the ball for the Super Skill Shot, and therefore that is\nyour only chance to relight the Player Piano before using it.\n\nIf Outlanes are set to \"easy\" on your machine, the Orange award from the\nSuper Skill Shot is likely your best choice, especially if you can perform\nDeath Saves or Bang Backs.  Otherwise, try for the Yellow award.  The problem\nis that the ball will be automatically delivered into the Jet Bumpers for any\nof the three awards, and you may never even get a shot at the temporarily lit\nExtra Ball.  This can be avoided by nudging the ball out of the Rocket Kicker\nimmediately after the Skill Shot.  This is most easily done with a good nudge\nas the ball first lands there, followed by several back-and-forth nudges to\nrattle the ball out.  With practice, this can be done even on fairly Tilt\nsensitive machines, and is often quite worthwhile, as it also enables a\nbrief, \"invisible\" ball saver.\n\nIf you choose not to shoot for the big awards from the Super Skill Shot (for\nexample, you have already stacked the maximum number of Extra Balls), you can\nstill safely collect the Red award by plunging the ball just hard enough to\nreach under the gate, trip the Red rollover sensor, and fall back to the\nplunger, from where you can plunge into the scoop.\n\nI do not feel that Fast Lock is worth shooting for in and of itself, as it\ndelays progress towards other Multiball modes and Lost In The Zone, and\nbecause of the generally difficult nature of the Lock Lane, it is hard to\nmake this Multiball pay off.  However, Fast Lock is a perfect opportunity for\ncollecting lit Outlanes or maximizing the payoff from Door Panel awards such\nas the Spiral Round, Town Square Madness, and various Clock rounds.  You can\nalso collect Hitchhikers \"safely\" during Fast Lock, although I try to avoid\nhaving all of the balls in the Jet Bumpers at any one time.\n\nLost In The Zone is a thrilling and almost overwhelming round, especially the\nfirst time you get to it.  There are several strategies for maximizing the\npoints collected during Lost In The Zone, but the single best strategy for\nhaving a high Lost In The Zone total is very simple - maximize your Bonus\nbefore you start Lost In The Zone.  The easiest way to do this is to have a\ngood Powerball Mania or two on the same ball first.  Even Clock Millions or\nTown Square Madness can be very helpful.  Regardless of how well you play\nduring the actual Lost In The Zone round, the Lost In The Zone Champion will\nalmost always be held by someone who had at least 200M in Powerball Mania\nwhen they started Lost In The Zone.\n\nDuring Lost In The Zone, I like to shoot for the Right Ramp early.  This\ngives you a good chance at one or more \"cheat\" Mania Jackpots from shooting\nthe Camera, along with the credit towards your Powerball Mania total for each\nwall hit, and the usual chance of a real Mania Jackpot.  Towards the end of\nthe round, the Clock Target becomes quite valuable.  At all times, the three\nGreed Targets in the lower left corner of the playfield are worthwhile shots,\nas they are very quick and if you miss, the ball will likely go into the Jet\nBumpers to increase your Town Square Madness Total.\n\nI recommend mostly ignoring everything else during Lost In The Zone.  Balls\nwandering around and being hit by the upper flippers (unless the Low Line\noption is set) will pick up a reasonable amount of everything else with no\nattention or effort on your part.\n\nIf you start a game with Town Square Madness lit, I recommend shooting for\nthe Lite Extra Ball Door Panel as soon as possible.  Otherwise, don't worry\nabout it too much unless it happens to come up.  My worst games have been\nthose where I worried too much about collecting this Door Panel and failed to\ndo anything else useful at all.  My only other advice about Extra Balls is\nthat you become familiar with the various ways of lighting them, and always\nkeep an eye on how many you have (on default settings, having four at a time\nprevents lighting or collecting any more).\n\nMost of the Combo Shots in Twilight Zone can safely be ignored.  You will\nmost likely run into the Gumball Combo and the ensuing 3-way Combo (to the\nPlayer Piano) most often.  If the Player Piano is not lit, you may wish to\nshoot for the 4-way Combo by aiming for the Hidden Lane.  After a fast Right\nOrbit shot, you may be able to put the ball through the Hidden Lane by simply\nholding the upper left flipper up.\n\nBonus Multiplier becomes very valuable later in a long game, if, for example,\nyou have 50 Hitchhikers and 30 Door Panels, in which case the Bonus\nMultiplier is worth 40M.\n\nDon't forget the Flipper Bonus.  Everything counts.\n\nMiscellaneous Scoring\nThese are some of the miscellaneous scoring values in Twilight Zone:\n\n\n Any kickout from the Slot Machine = 100K\n Spiral Helper opto sensors = 50K\n Inlanes = 100K\n Outlanes = 250K\n Right Ramp = 500K\n Left Ramp = 250K for gate, 250K for completion\n Lock Lane = 250K\n Unlit Camera = 500K\n Unlit Greed = 500K\n Unlit Power Payoff = 250K\n Rocket Kicker = 100K\n Slingshots = 2570\n\n\nTrick Shots\nThere are plenty of trick shots in Twilight Zone, and some of them are even\nreproducible.  Examples include:\n\n\n From either lower flipper into the Player Piano, bounced off of any post\nin the upper playfield area.  The most reliable case is a shot from the\nlower left flipper to the post to the right of the Right Ramp.\n From the upper left flipper into the Camera, bounced off of the Greed\nTargets alongside the Slot Machine.\n From the upper right flipper into the Player Piano, bounced off of the\nlowered upper left flipper.\n From the upper right flipper up the Left Ramp, flipped off of the upper\nleft flipper.\n From the upper right flipper backhanded up the Right Orbit.  This is\nespecially good when starting Powerball Mania.\n From the upper left flipper into the Lock Lane, bounced off of the post\nbelow the Player Piano.  This only seems to happen by accident.\n From the lower right flipper into the Lock Lane, bounced off of the Greed\nTarget that faces the upper right flipper.\n From the upper right flipper into the Slot Machine.  This requires a\nmoving ball, of course.\n\n\nThere are plenty more, but some of them are too unusual to be described or\neven believed.\n\nCheats\nThere are a few techniques that can be used when Twilight Zone that might be\nconsidered cheats.  All such cheats that I know of are described in this\nsection.\n\nAs has already been described elsewhere, you can collect \"cheat\" Mania\nJackpots during Powerball Mania and Lost In The Zone by shooting the Camera\nshortly after tripping the upper exit opto on the Powerfield.  This is\nprobably the most reliable and helpful of the cheats listed here.\n\nIf the Extra Ball Buy-In is enabled on your machine, you can use it in a\nmulti-player game as a cheat.  When the Buy-In is offered to Player One, wait\nfor the ball to be delivered to the plunger lane (this happens long before\nthe Buy-In expires).  Plunge the ball while the Buy-In is still being offered\nand, before the ball reaches the gate in the plunger lane, press Start or\nflip both flippers to abort the Buy-In.  The software will not notice that\nyou tripped the Skill Shot Rollovers.  Instead, it will see the ball in the\nSlot Machine and award a random Door Panel as if you had hit the Slot Machine\nfairly.  This will not work, of course, if your machine does not relight the\nSlot Machine automatically and it was previously unlit.  This trick works\neven on L-4 ROMs.\n\nI have been told that if there is at least one ball sitting in the Lock Lane\nand you have an Extra Ball lit, you can pick the machine up and trip the Lock\nLane sensor with that ball to collect the Extra Ball.  Supposedly, this will\nwork even when the machine has Tilted or when the Extra Ball Buy-In is being\noffered, but I have not verified this.  I have, however, had the machine\nmysteriously award the lit Extra Ball after a Death Save - this is likely the\nsame effect.\n\nWhen Lost In The Zone starts, any balls in the Lock Lane are ejected, of\ncourse.  However, these balls are ejected early in the opening animation,\nbefore other balls are put into play.  If you are careful, you can get this\nball up the Right Ramp right away, and if you trip the upper exit opto, the\nballs coming out of the Gumball Machine will be counted as Mania Jackpots!\n\nDeath Saves and Bang Backs\nDeath Saves are possible from the right drain on Twilight Zone, and are only\nmoderately difficult.  However, due to the distance from the trough to the\nflippers, it is difficult (but not impossible) to get a Death Save on a\nmachine with sensitive Tilt.\n\nBang Backs are extremely easy on most Twilight Zone machines, from either\nside drain.  The left drain requires a harder hit because the lower lane is\nmuch wider than on the right side.  I think that Twilight Zone is definitely\nthe best machine on which to learn how to do Bang Backs.\n\nTournament Mode\nIn Tournament Mode, Camera awards are parallelized; this means that the\nsame award is offered to each player even after another player has collected\nit, although Camera awards are still selected in the usual restricted but\nrandom fashion.\n\nWhen Extra Balls are disabled (as is common in tournament play), the Lite\nExtra Ball Door Panel is automatically lit.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Clock Millions is the currently flashing Door\nPanel, and the Slot Machine will always award the next available Door Panel\nstarting with Lite Gumball and proceeding counter-clockwise (that is to say,\nthe Slot Machine is no longer random).\n\nAnother reasonable modification for tournament play is to remove one ball\nfrom the machine, such that only two balls reside in the Gumball Machine.\nThis makes it easier to get a fair chance at playing the Powerball.  Even\nbetter is to remove the Powerball and have it simulated by software (use the\nmenu adjustment to indicate that no Powerball is present), although this\narguably detracts from the game a bit.\n\nExtra Ball Buy-In\nThis option, enabled by default, allows the player to purchase an Extra Ball\nfor one credit.  The game proceeds as if an Extra Ball had been collected in\nsome other fashion.  Temporary Extra Balls become unlit.  There is normally a\nten-second ball saver for the purchased Extra Ball.  Also, all seven Greed\nTargets are automatically lit, just as if the Camera: Lite Greed Targets\naward had been collected.  And of course there's a quote: \"Greeeeeeed\".\n\nThe Buy-In is especially useful when you're very close to some useful goal,\nsuch as Lost In The Zone, one or more Extra Balls, or the Grand Champion\nscore.  I would never recommend using real money to purchase the Extra Ball;\nyou should instead be able to use a credit from a Replay or a Special.\n\nEaster Eggs\nThis section includes semi-secret information, not all of which is really an\nEaster Egg.\n\nIn the first Extra Ball animation, the Extra Ball blows up.  In the second,\nit grows legs and a hat and walks away.  In the third, it turns into a\ndeflating balloon which lands on Talking Tina's face.  All subsequent Extra\nBall animations are the same as the first.\n\nOnce per ball and only during normal play, hitting the unlit Clock Target\nwhen all seven Greed Targets are already lit will award a Clock Bonus of 10M,\nwith a nifty sound effect and animation.\n\nScoring at least six hits on the Clock Target during a Clock Chaos round\ngets a special quote from Rudy of Funhouse fame: \"Quit playin' with the\nclock!\"  This also adds 25M to the Clock Chaos Total.\n\nAfter the 98th Robot, Robots are no longer counted.  Subsequent shots to the\nLeft Ramp or Lock Lane awards a Super Robot, which is an immediate 5M.  The\nCamera can no longer be lit by Robots once Super Robot is reached.  The Right\nInlane has no effect on the Super Robot on the Left Ramp.\n\nThe maximum number of Hitchhikers is 100.  When the 100th Hitchhiker is\nawarded, the display is slightly messed up.  There is no display for any\nfurther Hitchhikers collected, only a sound effect.  The 100th Hitchhiker\nlights Battle The Power for the last time by this method.\n\nThere is a secret award at the 8th and 20th Dead Ends, in P-3 and newer\nROMs.  When these Dead Ends are collected, the animation changes - the car\nsuddenly drives through the Dead End wall, with a twinkling effect and\nsound, and a Dead End Bonus of 100M is awarded.  Very cool.\n\nThere is a cow in the Replay animation.  Watch the center reel of the Slot\nMachine.\n\nIf a Replay is awarded by collecting your End-Of-Ball Bonus at the end of a\nball, flipping both flippers simultaneously will award a Flipper Bonus of 5M.\nIf you wait until the first reel of the Slot Machine has come to rest, this\nwill be accompanied by a pleasant sound effect.\n\nThere is a mysterious joystick on the backglass.\n\nThere is a miniature T-Rex on the backglass, being towered over by Rod\nSerling.  There are also some brontosaurs, but they seem irrelevant.\n\nThere is at least one attract mode sequence to display an Easter Egg: an\nextended version of the credits.  This sequence \"has not yet been published\".\nFeel free to pass any such sequences along to me, though :)\n\nThere are persistent rumours and reported sightings of the Super Stunt Cow\nin Twilight Zone.  It has always been reported in a particular context:\ncollecting a replay by loading the Gumball Machine.  Variations specify a lit\nright Spiral, a Powerball in play, lighting Extra Ball from the lit right\nSpiral, etc.  I have not seen this or been able to reproduce it, so if it\nexists, the conditions are likely very picky.\n\nPrototype Machines\nThere have been many changes from the rules of prototype Twilight Zone\nmachines.  These are mostly trivial and pointless to remember, but sometimes\nit's interesting to know.  The changes of which I am aware include the\nfollowing:\n\nCamera awards were at the Player Piano instead.  The Camera was the Jackpot\nduring Multiball.  There was no Super Slot round.  There was a Quick\nMultiball round (other than Fast Lock).  There was a Door Panel for 5M\ninstead of Lite Gumball.  Spiral Values did not include lighting Battle The\nPower.  The Clock Target was where the Power Payoff target is now.  Seven\nballs were installed in the machine, with four residing in the Gumball\nMachine.  There was an opto in the Hidden Lane.  There were two optos and\nSpiral Helper magnets on the Right Orbit.\n\nCosmetic changes include the following:\n\nThe Powerfield lacked point value labels and the FLIP HERE message.  The sign\nabove the upper right flipper did not indicate anything about the Gumball\nMachine (apparently this was handled by a small light where the Spiral lamp\nis now).  There was a sign above the upper left flipper indicating the\npurpose of the yellow lamp there (lit Spiral).  There was no Bonus X lamp on\nthe Left Ramp.  The flasher above the central Clock Target was red.  The Dead\nEnd lamp was red.  Why are you reading this paragraph?  A pair of glasses\nappears in the artwork atop the Slot Machine.  The Lock light was green.\n\nMusic\nThe main theme music of the Twilight Zone machine is derived, strangely\nenough, from the song \"Twilight Zone\" by Golden Earring.  Hey, why not?\nThere is also some use of the original Twilight Zone theme music, of course,\nand the other musical pieces are original compositions.\n\nQuotes\nA listing of Twilight Zone quotes (\"Quotes/tzone.quotes\") has been compiled\nby Brian Dominy, gt6139a@prism.gatech.edu, and thanks go to him and\neveryone who helped him out.

(duh!)\nIf you have any corrections, suggestions, or complaints, e-mail to\nthe author.\n\n\"Twilight Zone\" is obviously a licensed theme (though it\nstrangely lacks the word \"The\" at the start); anything having to do\nwith the game itself is probably owned by Bally/Williams.\n\nThis rule sheet is written both for those who have played TZ\nand those who haven't; as a result I probably have overdone certain\nportions, especially the description of the playfield.  However, some\n(few) portions are purposely vague, and point to \"spoilers\" which are\nprovided in a secondary post.  If you want to truly enjoy this game,\nand the discovery of cool stuff, don't touch the spoilers (don't\ntouch the spoilers don't touch... sorry - if you don't get that joke\nyet, you will soon).\n\nHope you like it, feel free to copy this thing as many times\nas you want; publish it in an Australian trade magazine for all I\ncare. :)  Extra thanx to Mike Lewis and Steve Bollinger for\noutstanding use of automobiles.\n\nBy the way, note the author of this piece: I'm Bowen, not\nKevin - no mail for Kevin ok? :)\n\nPlayfield Description and Very Basic Rules\nWe'll do this generally from left to right.\n\n\nLeft Inlanes/Outlane Twilight Zone has a very wide left inlane/outlane setup,\nmuch wider than that of TAF.  The left-side lane dividers are wide, and\nplastic; the divider of the two inlanes is below the slingshot, and the\nin/out divider is even lower, making it difficult to save a ball headed\nthere.  The lanes have rubber posts at the top, so it's not hard to\nsave a ball that hasn't chosen a lane yet.  The outlane can be lit for\nan Extra Ball (via Camera or Super Skill Shot), the left inlane lights\nthe right Spiral for a Gangway-type shot, and the right inlane lights\nthe Slot Machine briefly if it is unlit.\nNon-bumper zone Prototype TZ machines have a plastic bar to the left of the\nJet Bumpers, separating them from the left inlanes/outlane.  If this\nbar is there, it creates an area, like Whitewater, where the ball can\nhit a bumper without being in them.  Any ball in this area is a left\ndrain candidate.\nJet Bumpers there are three, located closer to the flippers than those on TAF,\nbut at the same angle.  Each bumper adds to the \"Town Square Value\",\nwhich is scored by a shot through the bumpers to a hole.  The value of\none of the three bumpers is advanced from 100K to 200K (or 200K to\n300K) by an unlit Camera shot, and a Skill Shot can advance several\n(see that section).  The Town Square Value starts each ball at 7.5M,\nand only carries over on a particular lit Camera shot (rare at best).\nThe Town Square Value maxes out at 25M.  The ball enters the bumpers\nafter a Hitchhiker shot, or an unsuccessful Battle the Power.  By the\nway, the Town Square hole serves many purposes; it takes balls from\nthe gumball machine, Camera, and a successful Battle the Power shot.\n\"Battle the Power\" (aka the Powerfield) is a mini-playfield located just\nbehind and above the Jet Bumpers (above the Town Square hole).  Its\nshape is a right-side-up triangle, with two holes: a bottom hole, if\nyou \"drain\", dumps the ball to the Jet Bumpers; another at the top is\nyour goal.  The best way to picture what it looks like is to imagine a\nChristmas tree shape, trunk at bottom.  Shave off the top two-thirds of\nthe tree, and you get a kind of trapezoid shape, not quite a rectangle\nbut closer to a rectangle than a triangle.  Now put a hole in the\nmiddle top, and replace the \"trunk\" with another hole.  Sounds weird,\nbut try picturing it or writing it down, and the mini-playfield looks\nquite a bit like it.  There are two magnetic flippers, dubbed Magna-\nFlip (TM), in the positions where you might expect regular flippers to\nbe.  Operating the flipper buttons turns the magnets on and off, and\nthe idea is to turn the magnet on, propel the ball toward the magnet,\nthen shut it off and let the ball's momentum carry it into the scoring\nhole.  The complete setup and a little strategy is discussed later.\nGumball Machine a real-looking, real-working machine that spits out pinballs\ninstead of gumballs.  Almost always, one of the gumballs is the\n\"Powerball\", a lighter ceramic ball which starts the Powerball round\n(described later).  The machine (with a working knob, check it out!) is\nfed by lighting \"Gumball\" on the ramps, then shooting the Right Spiral.\nIt's easy to know how many Gumball machine hits are needed to get the\nPowerball - we can see all the balls in the machine except the one\nwhich comes out next.  At the start of a game, the Gumball machine\nholds three balls; almost always, there should be three in there.\nHitchhiker shot this side shot is made by the upper right flipper, which is\nfairly low; the shot's angle and distance is similar to that of the\nTrapdoor on FunHouse, only reversed.  When shot, it awards a Hitchhiker\nPickup (the game begins with 1 Pickup awarded), which adds 500K to\nBonus, and lights Battle the Power at 3 and every 10.  The shot is\nmade automatically by the Rocket kicker, and if shot after a left\nSpiral, awards a \"Triple Pickup\" - 3 for the price of 1.  The Triple\nPickup animation is cool and spooky, and is described later.  The\nsensor for a Hitcher shot is on the upswing of the shot, so it's\npossible to get a Hitcher without going into the bumpers.  Depending\non table lean, it may be possible to shoot the Hitchhiker after a Left\nSpiral shot simply by holding up the flipper.\nCamera shot again, made by the upper right flipper, but slightly higher (angle\nsimilar to Rudy's mouth, in the other direction - it also resembles the\nLoad Cannon shot in Black Rose).  If unlit, the display reads \"Jet\nBumper Added\" - it only adds to the value of a bumper, not the number\nof bumpers. :)  If the Jets are at maximum (300K each) the display\nreads \"Jets at Max\", then nothing for any additional shots.  If lit (by\nthe Door or every 10 Robots), the Camera shot gives a semi-random\naward; it is described later.  The Camera shot also relights the\njackpot in the standard Multiball mode, but any shot to the Camera is\nnearly impossible without raising the small upper left flipper, which\nblocks most of the Camera hole!  Never thought flipping both flippers\nat once would be good for anything... actually, once raising the\nflipper is learned, the Camera shot is a cinch.\nUpper Left Flipper a brief comment that it is nearly impossible to SEE this\nflipper from a normal, standing position... it is blocked by the\n\"Battle the Power\" mini-playfield.  To see the flipper, and to make the\nshots the flipper requires, you need to move your head to the right...\nso everybody'll be playing like Rick Stetta at AMOA. :)\nLeft Spiral Beyond the upper left flipper is the orbit, called the Spiral.\nThis Spiral feeds the upper right flipper; the right feeds the upper\nleft flipper.  The angle of the left Spiral is near the Thing lock\nshot on TAF - it's a little to the left of it, at about the same\ndistance.  Either Spiral can be shot for the Spiral Value, which is lit\non the left Spiral for 5 seconds by shooting it or by rolling over the\nright inlane.  Spiral awards are 2M, 3M + light \"Battle the Power\", 4M,\n5M + \"Power\", 10M, then 10M, \"Power\", and Lite Extra Ball at once - in\nthe respect of working-to-an-extra-ball, it's very like FunHouse.  On\nnormal settings, the Spiral Award is 4M to begin, and carries over\nball-to-ball.  After lighting the EB, any additional Spiral shots that\nball are 10M; after the ball, the EB disappears and the Spiral value\nresets to 2M - it will reset to 2M every ball thereafter.  Both Spirals\nare equipped with magnets, which activate after a Spiral award and in a\nfew other instances - more on them later.  You can't collect a Spiral\nAward during any multiball.\nLeft Ramp This is almost the exact reverse of the Bear Kick ramp - it's easier\nto hit from the right flipper but possible to backhand, and returns the\nball to the left flipper.  The ramp lights the Piano if unlit, and\nreturns the ball to the \"Light Slot Machine\" left inlane.  It also\nscores a \"Robot\" - x Robots for an Extra Ball lit at \"Lock\" (ours went\nfrom 8 to 12; adjustable for 10% of games; it seems to never go below\n6 Robots), Camera lit at every 10 Robots.  It also spots \"Gum\" (the\nright ramp spots \"Ball\") - completing \"Gumball\" lights a Lock and the\nGumball machine.  The ramp has a diverter which can feed the auto\nplunger lane; a diverter at the lane can send the ball to the manual\nlane.\nBarney shoot this hole to the right of the Left Ramp, and a large, purple\ndinosaur comes out from under the playfield, stealing the ball.  This\nfeature has been eliminated in production machines, due to a lawsuit\nfrom Data East; it has been replaced by an identical purple groundhog.\nWatch the display, as each shot increases the size of Barney's stomach.\nFive shots make the stomach explode for a 50M \"Indigestion Bonus\" and a\nround of Intestinal Mania.\nClock Target a single, stand-up target between the two ramps, it's hittable\nfrom either lower flipper, and even from the upper edge of the top left\nflipper.  In regular play, the target lights one of the 7 5-million\ntargets (their locations in a bit) - if all 7 are lit, the Clock Target\nscores a one-time 10M \"Clock Bonus\", along with incredibly startling\nsound, flashing light, and cool animation.  Additional Clock hits (that\nball) with all 5M targets lit gives nothing but a \"cuckoo\" noise.  In\ncertain Door and Camera modes, the Clock Target is worth lots of points\nand more animations.\nRight Ramp A metal ramp in the same location and design as Star Wars, just to\nthe right of the Clock Target.  If \"Battle the Power\" is lit, the\nhabitrail feeds the ball to the mini-playfield.  If not, it tells you\nhow many Hitchhikers you need to light the Power as a hard-to-describe\ndevice (someone called it a \"carriage\") catches the ball on the\nhabitrail, then flips upside-down, dumping the ball just above the\nupper left flipper for a Piano shot.  If the carriage fails to deliver\nthe ball to the flipper, look out; the carriage's movement can send the\nball flying in any direction.  This doesn't happen all that often, tho.\n\"Lock\" a very very small target (size and location of \"Guile\" on SF2) which\nscores locks when lit from \"Gumball\".  3 locks are usually needed for\nmultiball; more on that later.  \"Lock\" also scores a Robot, and scores\nthe Extra Ball when lit.  Shots to \"Lock\" feed back to the upper right\nflipper. Balls which are locked stay there between games, but this is\nnot as much of a problem as it was in TAF - since Locks are scored so\nrarely, and multiball isn't hard to start once Locks are made, rarely\nare all three trough balls in Lock.  The Lock shot, on some machines,\nis also notorious for having balls rattle around in the entrance, then\ncoming straight back at the \"Shoot Again\" sign.  If yours does this,\ncomplain; the ramp piece is bent/broken.\nPlayer Piano This is a side shot from the upper left flipper; the angle is\nsimilar to the 5x Graveyard shot of TAF, but the distance is much\nshorter.  The Piano is lit at the start of each ball, and relit by the\nleft ramp; shooting it plays a brief tune, then awards the lit item on\nthe Door (I'm gonna call these \"Door Prizes\" :).  Shooting the Piano\nwhen unlit awards \"Odd Change\", which is quite funny; it gives a random\npoint award, as high as 10M, as low as... 10.  Two lights are above the\nPiano: a solid yellow light means the Piano will award a Door Prize, a\nflashing red light means it will award the Jackpot, neither awards Odd\nChange.  The Piano is relit at the start of each ball.\nClock Not a shot; it just seemed appropriate here.  The Clock is located just\nbehind the Piano shot, and it (usually) counts down scoring rounds and\nthings; the Clock can move at varying speeds, and once it hits 12,\nthat's the end of the round.  The Clock is a genuine, analog clock with\nhour and minute hands; the minute hand crosses sensors every 15 (Clock)\nminutes, in order to calibrate itself (watch closely when the Clock\nwinds itself back to 12, always in the easier direction; it overshoots\n12 by a few minutes, then reverses and stops on the sensor).  The\nsensors also cause display changes during Clock rounds, so watch the\ndisplay if you so desire.\n\"Power Payoff\" targets the only truly UNimportant targets in TZ.  After\nshooting \"Battle the Power\", either of the two standup Payoff targets\n(which are just below the Piano) is worth a one-time 10M bonus.  Yahoo!\nWell it IS worth something, and is a shot to make if the Piano isn't\nlit.  A shot to these targets when unlit causes \"the Power\" to laugh at\nyou - the voice is reminiscent of the Black Knight.\n\"Combo Hole\" won't score anything, it's just a passage just below the Payoff\ntargets down to the upper right flipper.  The combo hole is part of\nsome 3- and 4-Way Combos.  By the way, I made up the name, it's not\nnamed.  Better than \"Hole\" though.  The Combo Hole does have an optical\nsensor, but it appears to do nothing.  Maybe it just looks like an\noptical sensor.\nSlot Machine the Slot Machine is located nearly halfway up the playfield, on\nthe right side.  Its location is closest to the \"2\" and \"3\" targets on\nEarthshaker.  The Slot Machine hole is small, the size of the Electric\nChair (the Piano shot is twice as wide but equally hard-to-hit); a\nmissed shot will often result in a center drain, so it's risky.  The\nSlot Machine will award a random Door Prize if lit, and will not award\nthe flashing Door Prize unless it's the last one.  It will also never\naward \"Extra Ball Lit\" unless absolutely necessary.  Slot is lit at the\nbeginning of each ball, and is relit by the Right Ramp.  The rightmost\nLeft Inlane relights the machine for a few seconds.  The Slot Machine\nalso serves as kickout for many shots; any ball from a missed Skill\nShot comes out here, as well as balls from the Gumball machine, a\nsuccessful \"Battle the Power\", any shot to the Piano, Town Square or\nCamera holes, and of course a shot to the Slot Machine.  The kickout is\nalways to the right flipper; it's fairly simple to trap, although the\nSlot Machine occasionally kicks the ball (especially the Powerball)\ntoo close to the center drain - it really depends on your machine.  A\nyellow light is above the Slot: solidly lit awards a Door Prize, steady\nflashing awards Super Slot, flashing faster and faster awards Door\nPrize for a few seconds, unlit awards - yay - 100K.  The Slot Machine\nrelights at the start of each ball.\nRight Spiral located near the far right of the playfield (at an angle similar\nto Banzai Run's ramp, a bit further back), the Spiral scores the Spiral\nValue if lit from the leftmost inlane or a shot to the unlit Right\nSpiral.  This shot also puts a ball in the Gumball machine when lit by\nthe ramps.  The Right Spiral is a difficult shot (like there are easy\nshots on this game), and needs to be made on the far edge of the left\nflipper.\nUpper Right Flipper A standard-length flipper.  Just thought you might like\nto know.\nRocket Kickout an accidental shot; if the ball falls in the Rocket hole\n(located similarly to the Handcuff hole on Police Force), it is kicked\ninto the Jet Bumpers via the Hitchhiker shot (so it awards a free\nHitcher).  There's also a very brief rocket animation, which won't\ndisturb the game.  The ball also falls directly into the Rocket hole\nfrom a made Skill Shot.\nDouble Plunger Lanes TZ has a unique feature which incorporates the idea of\nboth an auto and a manual plunger (first done in Checkpoint), but like\neverything else, it's done better... in the Twilight Zone. :)  The ball\nis fed from the trough into the left (auto) plunger lane, and depending\non the position of the diverter, puts the ball in either the auto or\nmanual lane.  The only times a ball will be put in the auto-plunge lane\nare during any kind of multiball (Fast Lock, Powerball Mania, regular\nmultiball...) or if more than one ball somehow came out of the Gumball\nmachine (usually a mech. failure).  The auto-plunger kicks the ball\nthrough the Right Spiral, either to the top left flipper or into the\nGumball machine.  If the ball goes into the right, manual plunger lane,\nyou get a shot at the...\nSkill Shot The manual plunger lane has a one-way gate, followed by three\ncolor-coded rollovers.  The first is Red, second Orange, third Yellow,\nbeyond which is a sinkhole not unlike Creature's Snackbar.  The shot's\nworth is determined by the rollovers: Red awards 2M and advances a Jet\nBumper; Orange - 5M, 2 bumpers; Yellow - 10M, all 3 bumpers.  Shooting\nthe hole (100% Newbie award :) awards nothing... well, 1M plus 100K for\nthe Slot Machine kickout.  There is a \"Super Skill Shot\", more later.\n5-Million Targets (aka \"Greed\" targets) The seven 5M targets are all over:\n\none to the left of the entrance to the Jet Bumpers, another to their\nright\none, sideways, just below the entrance to the Hitchhiker shot\none just above the Piano shot; often a ball bounces into the Piano off\nthe edge of this target\ntwo, sideways, below the Combo Hole and to the left of the Slot\nMachine\none, frontwards, to the left of the Slot Machine.\n\n\nAll these targets are lit by the Clock Target, by a Door or Camera\naward, while the Powerball is in play, or during multiball.  The Clock\nTarget lights up one of the 7 targets, in no particular order.  Hitting\na 5M target turns that target off.  These are small, hard-to-hit\ntargets; I've never hit one on purpose, but then again I've never had\nnothing else to shoot at.  Some of the 5M targets are drain shots, so\nmake sure you know what you're doing - I find it simpler to ignore them\nand get lucky hits.\nRight Inlane/Outlane the Right Inlane lights three things - Dead End at the\nTown Square hole, Bonus X at the Left Ramp, and the Left Spiral for the\nSpiral Value.  Dead End stays lit for the rest of the ball until\nclaimed; the others time out quickly.  It is possible to shoot Dead End\nquickly enough to still shoot the Bonus X after the Slot Machine\nkickout.  The Right Outlane scores a Special if lit.  The divider\nbetween the inlane and outlane is just a metal piece, making it hard to\nsave a ball over there.\nBottom Flippers and Slingshots they exist.  Amazing.  :)  Well, at least the\nflippers are full-length.  The bottom flippers are near the \"Twilight\nZone\" playfield graphics, so in a too-well-lit room you might lose\ntrack of where those flippers are.\nDeath Saves and Bang Backs both are possible on TZ!  Rick Stetta successfully\ndid Bang Backs from both sides (however, it is much easier to do from\nthe right, a shorter distance); and on not-very-sensitive tilt\nsettings, Death Saves aren't difficult and can be made with only the\nsingle up-&-to-the-right push.  The side bar has given many a\nlaceration, so watch it...  Beware when Death Saving: bonus is quite a\nlot on this game, so \"deal with the devil at your own risk... in the\nTwilight Zone.\"  (That, by the way, is the quote given on a Tilt.)\n\n\nLots of stuff, huh?  And those are just the basics...\n\nThe Door\n\"You unlock this door with the key of imagination.\" -Rod...\nall quotes, unless otherwise noted, are by a dead (yes, \"dead\")\nringer for Rod Serling; take a long pause wherever you see \"-\" in the\nquotes.\n\nThe Door is not a shot, just as the Mansion is not a shot; the\nDoor sits in the middle of the playfield, and shows your progress in\nseveral things.  It gives your status on the Gumball machine - red\nlights, located on the top two panels of the Door light up when \"Gum\"\nor \"Ball\" is shot.  It gives your status toward multiball - orange\nlights, the bottom two panels of the Door, light up for Lock 1 and\nLock 2.  It gives your status on the 15 (15?!) Door Prizes (ok, fine,\nmaybe they're called Door Panels, but which sounds better?) - 14 of\nthem, in yellow, surround the Door, solidly lit if already collected,\nblinking if lit at the Piano.  The 15th is the white handle on the\nDoor.  The lit Door Prize is changed by the Jet Bumpers - this\nhappens a lot, and at the beginning of most balls, so the lit Door\nPrize is effectively random.  The Door Prize lit at the beginning of\na game is also random, a choice between Town Square Madness, Clock\nMillions, and Clock Chaos.  Following are the Door Prizes, with a\ndescription of each round, and any appropriate quotes or animations.\n\n(By the way, the order of the Door Prizes, clockwise from\nupper left:  Town Square Madness, X-Ball Lit, Super Slot, Clock\nMillions, Spiral, Battle Power, 10 Million, Greed, Camera,\nHitchhiker, Clock Chaos, Super Skill Shot, Fast Lock, Lite Gumball. A\nJet Bumper hit advances the lit Prize clockwise.)\n\n 10 Million \npicture: \"Big Points, 10 Million, Big Points\".  Wowee wow.\nquote: Rod - \"Ten million points.\"  Every quote is more\ninteresting... when said by Rod Serling.\n\nYeah RIGHT, Big Points my butt.  With the replay at 250 million, this\nreminds me of the 100K \"Big Points\" from T2.  A nice idea: this Door\nPrize is spotted by a Yellow Skill Shot, which scores 10M on its own.\nOn hard settings, the 10M Door Prize is not spotted.\n\n Light Extra Ball \npicture: a buncha balls.  Yawn.\nquote: Rod - \"An opportunity awaits you in the form of\nan extra... ball.\"\n\nLater, the Power yells, \"Get the Extra Ball!\"\n\nExtra Ball lights at \"Lock\".  Shooting any Extra Ball provides a nice\nanimation and sound: Talking Tina shows up and says \"My name is Talking\nTina.  Here's your Extra Ball!\" then throws the ball from the left side\nof the screen to the right.  Then something happens to the ball - for\nthe first EB, it explodes.  For the second, it grows legs, a hat falls\nfrom above, and the ball walks away.  For the third... well see the\nspoilers if you want to, but it's REAL funny.  There is a fourth, but\nI can't vouch for what it does or says, since I dunno.  Important:\ncollecting any other lit Extra Ball at \"Lock\" spots the EB Door\nPrize!  So make absolutely sure you get this Door Prize before getting\nan extra ball, else you'll get robbed.  That's any EB from Robot Ramp,\nDead End, Super Skill Shot, Spiral, or Outlanes.\n\n The Spiral \nanimation: three of those optical illusions where circles\nrotate and it looks like a 3-D column of circles.\nOne disappears for each Spiral shot in the round.\n\nquote: \"The spiral awaits you.\"  Ooh.  Later, the Power\nyells, \"Enter the Spiral!\"\n\nAs the Clock counts up (in most all timed rounds it circles from 12 to\n12 again, clockwise of course :), shooting either Spiral collects a\n\"Spiral Award\" - the first two are both 10M, the third is 15M.  As each\nSpiral is collected, cool quote from the Power: \"That's once...twice...\nthrice\" just like Seance.  Didn't hear a \"Well done!\" at the end, it's\nprobably not there.  Some Spiral strategy: since any ball kicked from\nthe auto-plunger goes through the Spiral, start multiball and get\nfree credit for one or two of them.  After the third Spiral shot, the\ndisplay shows a single Spiral bouncing across it, back and forth.  The\nClock continues to roll, and shooting a fourth (fifth, &c.) Spiral\nawards a \"Spiral Breakthrough\" (Power: \"Breakthru!\") worth 15M.  The\nfirst three Spirals stop the ball on the magnets (so a whole orbit shot\nreally isn't required), but a Spiral Breakthrough won't be stopped.\n\n Super Skill Shot \npicture: shows the Rocket.\n\nquote: \"This shot requires skill - super skill.\"\n\nSuper Skill Shot becomes lit on the Left Ramp (which pre-empts\nmultiball if lit); the ramp feeds the ball to the auto-plunger lane and\nthen to the manual lane.  Rod says, \"Be careful\", and you'd better be -\nit's very annoying to miss this one.  The awards: Red rollover lights\n\"Battle the Power\"; Orange lights the outlanes; Yellow lights Extra\nBall... shooting the sinkhole scores no major award.  Whichever you\nhit, even if you miss them all, you get 10M extra - it would've been\nnice if the sinkhole awarded nothing at all or even deducted points. :)\nThe Extra Ball disappears if unclaimed that ball.\n\nOh by the way - \"Lite Outlanes\" lights extra ball on the left outlane, special\non the right outlane; only one is lit at a time, changed by the slingshots.\nThe awards go away at the end of the ball - interestingly, both can be scored!\nIf one is awarded in a multiball, the other lights every other slingshot hit.\n\n Hitchhiker \npicture: a thumb.\n\nHitchhiker immediately awards 2M for every \"Hitchhiker Pickup\" you've\nscored in the game - potentially this can be a big bonus (I've had 30\nHitchers), and the game counts down each one with a \"Beoo...\" sound\n(sort of).  The countdown accelerates with more Hitchers, moving very\nvery quickly if you have more than 10 or 20.  For the rest of the ball,\neach Hitchhiker is worth an additional 2M - so the Triple Pickup is\nworth 6M and the \"10 Hitchhikers\" Camera award is worth 20M.  After the\ncounted bonus (awarded immediately), Rod says, \"Note the Hitchhiker...\nthere, by the side of the road.\"  Additional Hitchhiker shots that ball\nalso generate the \"Beoo...\" sound.\n\n Super Slot \npicture: the Slot Machine.\n\nquote: \"It seems that one of life's payoffs is ahead.\"\n\nanimation: while lit, the display shows slot machine awards\nlike a cherry or a 7; when shot, we see a machine\nspitting out money.\n\nAs the Clock ticks away, shoot the Slot Machine for a random score\naward - awarded immediately, it's always between 10 and 20 million.\nThis shot can be made several times in the round.  \"Can\".  Door Prizes\nare still awarded by the Machine in Super Slot round - the same rules\nstill apply.\n\n Clock Millions \npicture: gee, the Clock... oh forget the pictures.\n\nquote: \"This clock... is worth millions.\"\n\nanimation: The clock sits on the screen; each hit to the\nClock Target sends a pinball into the corner\nof the clock, damaging it.\n\nFor as long as the Clock turns around, a hit to the Clock Target scores\nas many points as the hour on the Clock.  So if you hit the target\nimmediately, it scores 12 million, then 1M, 2M, etc.  There's a short\ngrace period at the end in which you can hit the target for 12M again.\nEach hit further damages the displayed clock on the screen; five hits\nawards an end-of-round \"Clock Damage Bonus\" of 10M.  Six hits awards\n20M in Clock Damage.  Seven, anyone?  The total from Clock Millions\n(including Clock Damage bonus) is tacked on at the end of your ball.\n\n Greed \nquote: \"The stakes are higher - in the Twilight Zone.\"\nanimation: shows a cash register with a \"cha-ching\" every time a\nGreed target is hit.\n\nThe Greed total starts at 5M.  As the Clock counts, hit as many of the\n5-Million targets as possible; each adds 5M to the Greed total, which\nis awarded at the end of the ball.  Upon hitting the first Greed\nGreed target, a voice yells, \"You want more?\"  Then with each\nsuccessive target hit, it yells \"More!\" louder and louder.  A cool\nquote at the end of the Greed round: \"There.  See what... Greed will\nget you?\"  Rod says this, not Gomez...  Like regular play, hitting a 5M\ntarget turns it off.\n\n Fast Lock \nquote: \"It's time to tune in to - the Twilight Zone.\"\nanimation: shows a radio dial changing from right to left.\n\nThe Fast Lock score begins at 20M, and drops to 5.3M over about 15 sec.\nEvery 3 seconds, the radio stops at a \"station\", the score stops\nfalling (making it the frequency of the station!), and we hear a quote\nfrom one of Pat Lawlor's earlier games, in reverse chronological order.\nShooting \"Lock\" after a quote gives the current Fast Lock score, a\nsecond quote from the game, begins a musical piece from it, and starts\na 3-ball quick multiball, during which (like Thing multiball) any shot\nto \"Lock\" awards that value again.  The quotes and music:\n\n\nfrom TAF, Cousin It mumbles, \"Babadabadababa...\" or whatever.\nHitting \"Lock\" yields the sound when hitting It, and begins the TAF\n\"get the Jackpot\" music.\nfrom FunHouse, Rudy says, \"Hey, it's only pinball!\"  Hitting yields\nthe Rudy Gulp sound (\"Gulp... ptooey!\"), and begins the \"get the\nJackpot\" music.\nfrom Whirlwind, \"Return to your homes.\"  Hitting: \"Do not panic.\"\nMusic: get the Jackpot.\nfrom Earthshaker, \"It's sunny drive time!\"  Hitting: \"Ooh ooh,\ngimme shelter!\"  Music is from regular gameplay, though...\nfrom Banzai Run, \"Welcome race fans!\"  Hitting: \"Go for the Hill!\"\n(sadly not \"Banzaii!!\") and the standard game music, courtesy Brian\nSchmidt (now of Data East).\n\n\nShooting Fast Lock before Cousin It mumbles doesn't award anything\ndifferent, unfortunately.  Be nice to have another hidden thingy there.\nOne thing of note is that the Earthshaker and Banzai Run quotes were\nclearly redone for TZ; they're close but not quite the real thing.\nAlso, notice the sound between \"stations\" - ooh static.  Like other\nmultiballs, having the Powerball in play lites the Powerball Loops for\n10M bonus (these are described later).  Fast Lock really isn't worth\nthat many points; during it, you might prefer to shoot things like\nHitchhiker, which you normally might be afraid to shoot in regular\nplay.\n\n Clock Chaos \nquote: \"Time is a one-way street - except in... the\nTwilight Zone.\"\n\nanimation: a small robot (or astronaut) stands next to a\nClock, winding it to \"Pop Goes the Weasel.\"\n\nAs with Clock Millions, 5M is awarded automatically, and any hit to the\nClock Target awards the time on the clock.  However... for this round,\nthe Clock starts at 6, and begins to move backwards.  A hit to the\nTarget stops the clock (on display: a pinball nails the guy winding the\nClock, who gets mad, destroys the ball, and begins to wind the clock\nfaster) - and also changes the direction of the Clock!  If the Clock\never hits 12 on either side, the round ends - not immediately, there's\na short grace period at 12 so keep trying!  Potentially scoring in\nClock Chaos is unlimited - however, the Clock begins to move VERY\nquickly after three hits.  After 5 hits, a very appropriate and\nhilarious quote comes out... see the spoilers, but this is one you want\nto find out for yourself.  Clock Chaos is an end-of-ball award, and\ncan go very very high - I've gone as high as 105M on it.\n\n The Camera \nquote: \"It is a most unusual camera.\"  The Power then says,\n\"Look to the future!\" since the camera shows the\nfuture... sometimes Rod says this.\n\nThis award, as well as every 10 Robots, lights the Camera hole for an\naward.  Lighting Camera from the Door allows you to collect two Camera\nawards, while every 10 Robots lites one Camera award.  Camera award\ncollections are stackable, and carry ball-to-ball.  You are told what\nthe award is before you collect it; however, the sequence of awards is\napparently random (you can't say, \"Oh well it's 20 million now, so next\ntime it'll be Collect Bonus!).  The awards:\n\n\n20 million... more \"big\" points.  Actually it's a good award, just\nboring.\nLite Greed Targets: all 5M targets lit for immediate collection.\nThis also means that the Clock Target is immediately lit for 10M -\nbut they don't want you to know that. :)\nHold Town Square: Town Square Value stays where it is.  Poor award.\n3x Town Square: Awards 3x the current Town Square Value.  This can\nbe as high as 75M.\nClock 10 Millions: A timed round.  10M is awarded automatically,\nand during the round any Clock Target hit is another immediate 10M\nbonus.  The animation is exactly like Clock Millions; enough hits\nagain awards the Clock Damage bonus.  Rod begins the round (as with\nClock Millions) with \"This clock is worth millions.\"\nLite Outlanes: see above.\nCollect Bonus: (right out of Tristan!) awards end-of-ball bonus\nimmediately.  Potentially, this is the largest award in the game:\nsee the section on Bonus (Once I had a 300M bonus).\n10 Hitchhikers: well what do you think?  Note that thhis also\nautomatically lites \"Battle the Power\", since every 10 Hitchers\ndoes that.\n\n\nAMOA play kept all awards except \"Collect Bonus.\"  The sequence of\nCamera awards is random, but an award will not be given twice until a\nsequence of all eight awards has been completed.  For example, the\nsequence could run 1-7-4-5-2-6-8-3 then 8-3-1-7-... but the entire\neight are given out before it begins again.  The same award is never\ngiven as the last of one sequence, then the first of the next.\nUnusual, but oh well.  If the ball is sent around either Spiral (unless\nGumball is lit or if in Powerball mode), a magnet in the back right\nwill STOP the ball on the Spiral, then release it for a slow, easy shot\nat the Camera.  The accompanying sound is the famous TZ theme music\n\"Doo doo doo doo...\" and the display \"Spiral Helper\".\n\n Town Square Madness \nquote: \"There is madness in town square.\"\n\nanimation: COOL, see round description.\n\nAs the Clock counts (round, like most, probably lasts 12 seconds), each\nplayfield target is worth 350K; the total begins at 3M and is shown on\nthe display.  Meanwhile a picture of the town square (buildings & cars)\nis shown with people running about and screams in the background; each\ntarget hit throws a brick or rock at the people and store windows.  The\ntarget value is increased by 25K for each hit at the Jet Bumpers; each\nhit generates a quite close-up animation of a panicking man or woman\nscreaming and holding their head; VERY cool.  The Madness total is\nadded to the end-of-ball bonus; a poor round can be less than 10M, a\ngood round can be more than 40M, best I've seen is 75M.  Also, the\n\"Spiral Helpers\" are active during Madness round - they'll stop the\nball in the Right Spiral, tell you to shoot the Hitchhiker for Jet\nBumpers, at which time you shoot the Hitchhiker.\n\n Battle The Power \nquote: the Power shouts, \"Are you ready to battle?\"\nthen usually adds, \"Feel lucky?\" or laughs.\nWhen Battle the Power is lit, just shoot the Right Ramp to enter the\n\"Powerfield\" - the magnetic mini-playfield.  The animation shows what\nyou see on the back of a one-dollar bill: a triangular pyramid with a\nsingle eye in one face.  The Powerfield score begins at 5M for a round;\nhitting any of the three walls of the playfield awards 500K; should you\nbe successful in defeating the Power during a ball, the walls are worth\n750K in the next round - they become 1M if you win a second time (the\nlimit).  Each hit shoots a ball at the pyramid in the display and is\ndeflected (or other things - look closely).  Battle the Power lasts 10\nseconds - typically, about 20 hits on the walls are recorded in a\nlosing effort, any number less than that in a victory.  If you lose,\nthe Power laughs at you and Rod says, \"Never underestimate the Power...\nin the Twilight Zone.\"  If you win, the display shows the Power Pyramid\nexploding, the Powerfield total for THAT ROUND is doubled, and the lit\nDoor Prize is immediately awarded.  This is accompanied by one of the\nmost catchy visuals and sound effects: a hand makes a fist and bangs on\nthe bottom of the display three times, \"Boom boom boom.\"  (Knock three\ntimes...)  Every time we defeated the Power, everyone playing shook\ntheir fists up and down with the animation.  When Battle the Power\ntimes out, keep going - there's about a second of grace period, and a\nvictory shot still counts.  Also, a ball can be stuck in the corner of\nthe Powerfield; if the ball search (which operates all flippers,\nincluding magnetic ones) kicks the ball into the victory hole, you get\ncredit for a Camera shot.\n\n Lite Gumball Machine \nquote: \"This is no ordinary gumball machine.\"\n\nAs said, the Gumball machine is lit on the Right Spiral by the Door or\nby both ramps.  When the Spiral is hit, the display reads \"Gumball\nLoaded\", as the ball is diverted into the top of the machine.  The\nbottom ball is then kicked out, and points are awarded - 15M for the\nfirst gumball loaded, 20M for the second, 25M for all thereafter.  The\npoints are only awarded for shooting a regular ball into the machine;\nloading in the Powerball does something quite different.  Notice the\nknob on the gumball machine: pretty cool, it actually works.  One\nfurther note about the Gumball machine: it is lit in regular play by\nthe two ramps.  However, once it is lit from the ramps, it can't be lit\nagain by the ramps until a lock is made... meaning you can't just keep\nfilling up on gumballs all day long.\n\n\n important: the Gumball Machine is notorious for kicking two balls\ninstead of one, ruining the game.  L-2 R0Ms fix the problem, but if\nyou have earlier R0Ms, get the operator to change the settings to\n\"Gumball Machine Disabled\".  No ball will ever go in or out of the\nMachine, but the scoring is handled just the same.  With this\nsetting, Powerball mode is awarded for every two Gumball Machine\nshots, even though the Powerball never comes into play.  No balls in\nor out of the Gumball Machine; it has its disadvantages, but I think\nit's worth doing to avoid Gumball Hell.  Another, more difficult\nsolution is to examine the solder joints of the optical switch at the\nMachine's entrance; this is what causes the whole problem.\n\n\n ? \n\nOh you think I'm gonna tell you that?  Guess what... see the spoilers.\n\nThe Powerball\nThere are three ways to get the Powerball on the playfield,\ndepending on its original location.  The first (and the way you're\nsupposed to do it) is to load the Gumball machine with the Powerball\nat the bottom.  The second is to have a player drain the Powerball;\nsince it's now in the ball trough, it's gotta come out eventually,\nand when it does, the Powerball round begins for free.  The third is\nto have someone shoot the Powerball into \"Lock\", which, I used to\nthink, was one of the dumbest things anyone could do in TZ - now I\nthink it's not very beneficial but a lot of fun.  Then if either\nmultiball begins, or a ball needs to be kicked out of Lock (the ball\nin play changes with each unlit Lock shot), the Powerball pops out.\nHaving the Powerball going during multiball (standard multiball only)\ncan be worthwhile though annoying; why later.\n\nThe Powerball is a lighter, white ceramic ball of the same\napproximate radius of a regular pinball.  Playing with the Powerball\nmay remind you of playing with a pool ball; memories will come back\nfor those who have played Atari's \"Hercules\".  Being lighter, the\nPowerball moves much faster than a regular ball, and is a bit more\ndifficult to handle.  It also has a greater tendency to fly through\nthe air, but TZ is designed well enough that this rarely happens.\n\nThe Powerball round begins when the Powerball is on the\nplayfield; the software will know when this has happened, and if it\ncan't tell, any shot to the Slot Machine (which must have a magnetic\nsensor underneath) kickout will jog its memory.  Immediately \"the\nPower\" shouts \"POWERball!\" and then a variety of taunts: \"I want it\nback!\"  \"Give it back!\"  \"It's not yours!\"  \"Too hot to handle?\"\n\"Don't miss!\"  \"Miss and you lose it all!\" (note rhyme!)  The display\nshows a ball trapped between two magnetic lightning fields, and also\nthe \"Powerball Payoff\" value.\n\nAlmost everything on the playfield can still be collected\nwhile the Powerball is in play; only magnet-related items are\ndisabled - i.e., \"Battle the Power\" is disabled during the round.  In\naddition, the Left Spiral is worth a 10M \"Powerball Loop\" bonus.\n(This is true even if the Gumball Machine is disabled.)\n\nDuring the round, all the Greed targets are lit; the Powerball\nPayoff begins at 10M (P-R0Ms: 5M) and goes up by 5M with each hit.\nShooting the Gumball machine awards this Payoff, and shows an\nanimation of the machine being shattered.  The Payoff is fairly\nunimportant; don't worry about only getting 10M out of it.  After\nloading the Gumball machine, a round of...\n\nPowerball Mania\n\nbegins.  Powerball Mania is a 3-ball multiball (one ball from\nthe Gumball machine, two others from the trough or \"Lock\") during\nwhich all playfield targets are initially worth 250K.  The Clock also\nstarts ticking away; when it gets back around to midnight, targets no\nlonger add to the Powerball Mania total.  In addition, the Right Ramp\nis lit (to begin) for \"Battle the Power\".  As in normal play,\nshooting the ramp sends the ball to the mini-playfield, activating\nthe magnetic flippers; each wall is worth 750K, plus the 250K target\nvalue if the Clock hasn't gone around yet.  Any ball can be shot to\nthe Powerfield (the Powerball can't be in play); with skill, all 3\nballs can be there at once.  For each shot to the Powerfield, 5\nseconds of action are awarded - you can hear a 3-2-1-zero countdown.\nThe goal of Powerball Mania is to defeat the Power (shoot the victory\nhole); doing this awards the Mania Jackpot of 50 million and a big\nJackpot animation.  If 2 balls are on the Powerfield at the time, the\nsecond can be shot in for another 50M!  After a Jackpot, the Right\nRamp will not load the Powerfield until it is relit by shooting the\nLeft Ramp once.  There is a brief ball saver at the beginning of\nPowerball Mania... drain quick and you'll get it back.\n\nIt isn't very hard to score a Mania Jackpot; after enough\nshots to the Powerfield (especially if multiple balls at a time),\none's sure to bounce in.  My best Powerfield total is just under 300M\n(299.75M to be exact :).  One very very important thing: DON'T TILT\nafter getting Powerball Mania - it's part of the end-of-ball bonus.\n\n(Sorry, no quotes from Rod in this round.)\n\nMultiball\nThe main multiball in TZ is fairly difficult to begin, fairly\ndifficult to light for a high score, and fairly difficult to\nachieve.  There are slightly differing rules for the first and second\nmultiballs.\n\nFor the first multiball, the first Lock is lit by completing\n\"Gumball\"; always, \"Gumball\" will light a lock if it isn't already.\nAfter locking the first ball, the display shows a door surrounded by\na magnetic field, and the quote, \"Beyond this door is a dimension of\nsight,\" closely followed by someone yelling \"Don't touch the door!\"\nThe display then reads, \"Shoot Lock or Left Ramp, Jackpot 15M\".\n(P-R0Ms: 10M)\n\nA shot to the Left Ramp begins multiball immediately; a shot\nto \"Lock\" locks a second ball which yields the same animation, the\nquote, \"Beyond this door is a dimension of sound,\" then \"Don't touch\nthe door!\" is repeated twice in rapid succession.  We then see \"Shoot\nLock or Left Ramp, Jackpot 40M\" - obviously locking the second ball\nis worth the trouble.  (P-R0Ms: 35M)\n\nThen either the Left Ramp or \"Lock\" begins multiball - it is\nto your advantage to shoot the ramp, since the auto-plunger kicks the\nball to the upper left flipper.  When multiball begins, we see the\ndoor and the frantic quote, \"Don't touch the door don't touch the\ndoor don't touch the door...\" faster and faster, until the door\nfinally explodes and all 3 balls are kicked out.  Rod declares,\n\"You've just crossed into... the Twilight Zone.\"  Thanks, Rod!  The\nJackpot is scored at the Piano shot (lit immediately), so if a ball is\nauto-plunged, it goes past the upper left flipper at a speed\nsuitable for shooting the Jackpot.  If all balls come from the Lock\nkickout, shoot them at the upper left flipper; chances are good that\none of them will bounce into the Piano.\n\nWhile the Jackpot is lit, the 7 5M targets flash; shooting any\nof them adds 5 million to the Jackpot.  Upon shooting the Jackpot, it\ncan be relit by shooting the Camera - this is very difficult since it\nrequires both flippers.  The Jackpot is relit at 10M more than its\nvalue at the last time the Jackpot became lit; for example, if you\nstarted multiball at 15M jackpot, scored it at 35M, then relit it,\nthe Jackpot would begin at 25M.  If you then scored it again for 25M,\nthen relit it, the Jackpot would then begin at 35M.\n\nOne cool thing during multiball; the Spiral magnets are\nactive, so if a Spiral shot is made, the ball is fed slowly to either\nthe upper left flipper if the Jackpot is lit, or the upper right\nflipper if the Jackpot needs to be relit.  When this occurs the \"Doo\ndoo doo doo\" sound effect plays, so if you're flailing away at balls\nit's easy to know you've got a shot at the Jackpot coming up.  The\nsame goes for a Right Ramp shot with the Jackpot lit; it tells you\nit's gonna dump the ball before it does it.\n\nIf, somehow, the Powerball is in play during multiball,\nshooting either Spiral will award a 10M \"Powerball Loop\" bonus;\nhowever since the Powerball is ceramic, the Spirals will not feed the\nPowerball neatly to the flippers, even though the \"Spiral Helper\"\ngraphic and sound still plays (confusing...)  BUT - awesomely,\nshooting the Jackpot with the Powerball (and only with the\nPowerball!) DOUBLES the jackpot (with a special display).\n\nIf the Jackpot is missed entirely, multiball can be restarted\nby hitting \"Lock\" within 12 seconds - this is a hard, hard shot to\nmake.  If it is accomplished, two balls are kicked from the\nauto-plunger (so multiball restart is 3 balls), and the Jackpot keeps\nits previous value (like TAF).  There's no third chance.  While\nmultiball restart is lit, good music is played, with the Power (or,\nperhaps, the \"Don't touch the door\" voice) saying things at you,\nincluding \"You can do it!\" like Black Knight.  Miss entirely, and Rod\nsays, \"You have just taken a detour out of... the Twilight Zone,\" or\nsomething like that.\n\nDifferences for the second multiball: both Locks 1 and 2 must\nbe lit separately (so \"Gumball\" needs to be completed twice), and it\nisn't possible to start multiball from the left ramp.  Third and\nlater multiballs require a third completion of \"Gumball\" to \"light\nRelease\" at Lock; all later multiballs have base Jackpot 40M (P-R0Ms\nsomething else.)\n\nThe Combos\nNear as I can tell, there is one 2-Way Combo, seven 3-Way\nCombos, and four 4-Way Combos in TZ.  The 2-Way Combo, called the\n\"Gumball Combo\", is Left Ramp to Right Ramp, and is only awarded when\nneither \"Gum\" nor \"Ball\" is lit to begin with.  No score is listed on\nthe board, but it must be worth something.\n\nOne of the 3-Way Combos is a continuation of this: Left Ramp\n-> Right Ramp -> Piano awards 10M.  Two combos utilise the \"Lock\"\nshot; they are Left Ramp -> \"Lock\" -> Camera or Hitcher.  Two 3-Ways\nuse the Combo Hole; Right Ramp -> Combo Hole -> Camera or Hitcher.\nTwo more use the Spiral Helpers; Left Ramp -> Right Spiral (w/Helper)\n-> Camera or Hitcher.  I think that's all there are, but considering\nhow many exist, there may be more.  All 3-Way Combos are worth 10M.\n\nOne 4-Way Combo is Left Ramp -> Right Ramp -> Combo Hole ->\nHitcher or Camera; the other is Left Ramp -> Right Spiral (no Helper)\n-> Combo Hole -> Hitcher or Camera.  All 4-Way Combos are worth 20M.\n\nMost people won't notice it at first (including me), but\nthere's a VERY simple way to hit the Combo Hole shot from the upper\nleft flipper.  As the ball comes to the flipper from the Right Spiral\n(moving quickly), just hold up the flipper and the ball heads\nstraight for the Combo Hole!  Obviously this depends on the\nparticular table, and may not even have been the design idea.\n\nBonus Count\nBonus Count can be worth a whole heckuva lot in TZ.  As with\nall Lawlor games, bonus is determined solely on particular shots and\nrounds; you won't add 1,OOO to your bonus by hitting a Jet Bumper.\nBonus is calculated as\n\n(500K * Hitchhikers + 500K * Door Prizes) * Bonus X + Special Rounds\n\nBonus X is lit on the Left Ramp for 5 seconds after rolling\nover the Right Inlane.  Bonus X really isn't worth shooting for; from\nthe inlane, it's a better idea to shoot for Dead End or the Left\nSpiral instead.\n\nSpecial Rounds can be worth a LOT of points, pushing Bonus\ninto the stratosphere:\n\n\nPowerfield: total of all \"Battle the Power\" rounds - can be     70M + \nTown Square Madness round:                                      50M   \nClock Millions round:                                           70M   \nClock Chaos:                                                    50M   \nGreed:                                                          30M   \nPowerball Mania:                                                300M  \nfor a big total of                                              570M  \n\n\nObviously you wouldn't expect that kind of bonus all the time,\nbut considering the default Grand Champ score is 750M, Bonus can sure\nhelp you get there.  When awarding Bonus, each screen comes up as it\ndoes in TAF, and in TZ, it acts as a card and falls forward (with a\nslight boom) to reveal the next card; it's pretty catchy and forms a\ngood beat to tap to.  If your bonus is over 100M, you get another\ncool quote: \"Big risk, big reward... in the Twilight Zone.\"  The\nbonus count can be sped up by holding down both flippers!... the\ncards fall as fast as possible, but no quote for 100M bonus.\n\nMiscellaneous Scoring, Animation, etc.\nSome additional features of TZ that didn't seem to fit\nanywhere else:\n\n Dead End \nanimation: The Town Square Value animation shows a car\ndriving; the Dead End animation shows the same car crashing\ninto a wall.  Oh it's so cute. :)\n\nDead End can be lit at the Town Square collect hole, behind the Jet\nBumpers.  It is lit by rolling over the right inlane and remains lit\nuntil the end of the ball or until collected.  Dead End scores double\nthe Town Square value; an adjustable number of Dead Ends lights an\nExtra Ball (this was 3 on our machine - sounds easier than it is).  8\nDead Ends awards your bonus, and there may be a later award.  The Dead\nEnd EB disappears if unclaimed that ball.\n\n Triple Pickup \n(animation)\n\nOn a background of a graveyard, we see the same picture of the\nHitchhiker from any ordinary Hitcher shot.  (But this is no ordinary...\nsorry.)  Then, a second appears on the same screen, with the first\nstill there.  Then a third.  One (or all) of them says, \"Going my way?\"\nand then they all disappear.\n\n Robot Ramp \n<\nanimation: Robby the Robot moves his arms.  Wow.\n\nThe first EB on the Robot Ramp is adjustable and stays near 10; there\nis a second EB lit at 45 Robots.  There may be some kind of award for\n100 (or more?) Robots.\n\n \"Shoot Again\" \nAnimation shows the one-inch astronaut walking from right to left,\nholding a pinball.  At left he drops be ball (clunk, clunk), then turns\nto you and says, \"Webba wobba wobba\" - an immediate translation is\nprovided: \"Shoot again\".\n\n Extra Ball Buy-In \n\nWhen your game ends, you're given the option to buy an extra ball for 1\ncredit.  Hitting the \"Extra Ball\" button gives the Extra Ball and\nusually a most appropriate quote (see the Spoilers).  If you don't want\nthe extra ball, you can flip both flippers, hit the Start button, or in\na multi-player game, just plunge the ball.  Extra Ball Buy-In should\nonly be used if you're close to a big feature (like the Door handle) or\nif you're close to a replay or high score; the local PAPA tournament\nimmediately made up the rule that if you got a replay you could use the\ncredit to buy an extra ball.  Strange.  Any high score managed because\nof the bought extra ball counts just the same; I think this is a good\nidea, but hey it's a rule sheet not a commentary.  Important: you can\nonly buy one extra ball, so no kid with 200 tokens is gonna get the\nhigh score.  You have 7 seconds to decide to buy (or not) the EB.\nBuying an EB immediately lights all 7 5M targets, so the Clock is also\nlit for 10M.  (Now why are those targets on? :)  In addition, a ball\nsaver comes on for around 15-20 seconds; should you drain in this time,\nthe display reads \"Player n Keep Shooting\" as the ball is auto-plunged.\nRod then adds, \"Things are not as they first appear...\" though I'll\nhave to check that quote.\n\n Replay \nReplay animation is the same as the animation for a Slot Machine shot;\nthe Slot Machine spins around, and lo and behold, the three wheels stop\non \"PL\", \"AY\", and \"RE\", in no particular order.  A cool add-on here:\nif the machine is set to award extra balls instead of replays, this\ndisplay will show that instead.  I haven't seen the actual display, but\nyou can tell that as the wheels spin around to \"Replay\", they could've\nspun around to some sort of Extra Ball display.\n\n Match \nMatch animation is done very quickly (yay!): the one inch astronaut\nholds a gun, pointed at a match number (which doesn't match any of the\nplayers' scores), with the scores (last 2 digits, that is) below.  He\nfires, and the match number appears immediately in an explosion.  If\nyou matched, your number lights up immediately with a click; if you\ndidn't, your number explodes.  The astronaut then flips the gun into\nthe air, catching it after it does a full twist.\n\n Random Quote \n(it didn't fit anywhere else)\n\nOccasionally, Rod will say, \"Not an ordinary day\", near the beginning\nof the game.  Sometimes he'll add to that, \"nor an ordinary place.\"  No\napparent reason...\n\n Jackpot Animation \n(didn't fit anywhere else)\n\nLessee... begins all dark, then a circle of light flashes out, showing\nthe outlines of the word \"Jackpot\".  More circles until the entire\ndisplay is light, then the lights in \"Jackpot\" pulse bright and faint\n(never off), then an explosion and a display of how much you got, with\nthe Power shouting \"Jackpot!\"  It's cooler than that, I assure you.  Oh\nand there's music too.\n\n Theme Song \nThe Powerball Mania, jackpot, and attract mode music are based on the\nearly 80's rock song, \"Twilight Zone\" by Golden Earring.  The song is\nadapted for TZ, so it's a bit different from the original.  The song\nalso had some lyrics (strangely enough), and here's the chorus:\n\n\nHelp, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone\nThis is a madhouse, feels like being home\nMy feet they can't move under moon and star\nWhere am I to go now that I've gone too far... (repeated)\nYou are gonna know when the bullet hits the bone. (repeated)\n\n\nUm...yeah...ok.  The entire lyrics are available by request.\n\n High Scores \nGetting one of the high scores obviously gives you the chance to put\nyour name on the high score list.  It does generate a quote from Rod:\n\"That was neither an ordinary game, nor an ordinary player.\"  Cool...\nsame initial entry as every other game, GC 2 credits, others 1.  An\nadditional credit is provided for \"Lost in the Zone Champion\" (look at\nthe high score table); if you had a high score, you won't need to re-\nenter your initials for LITZ.\n\n The Joystick Conspiracy \nTZ is the third Lawlor game to have a particular item on the backglass.\nCheck out Whirlwind (if you can find one!) if you get the chance, and\nyou'll see a guy holding a red joystick in his left hand, with a button\nat the top and what looks like a phone cord at the bottom.  Now look at\nFunHouse - Rudy, in a shot where his body is showing, is holding the\nsame thing, also in his left hand.  Now look at the dummy in the box on\nTZ - same thing, same hand.  Ooh it's spooky (not); someone suggested\nthis was done by art director Youssi, but no joystick has been seen in\nany other Bly/Wms games.\n\n Tournament Mode \nChanges in the TZ rules for AMOA play: Lite EB is always spotted on the\nDoor.  Clock Chaos is the first flashing Door Prize.  The Slot Machine\nfirst awards \"Lite Gumball\", then the next Prize in counter-clockwise\norder throughout, including the flashing Prize but not lit ones.  The\nCamera award is the same sequence for all players.  Of course, no extra\nballs, so the Super Skill Shot awards 10M plus Battle Power for Red,\nLite Special (1M) Half The Time for Orange, nothing for Yellow.\n\n 5-Ball Mode \nIf your TZ is set for 5-ball play (5 balls per game, not 5 balls\ninstalled), there are minor changes: a Yellow Skill Shot won't spot the\n10M Door Prize, Spiral Awards begin at 2M, Piano and Slot don't relight\nautomatically at the start of a ball, and two locks are required to\nstart the first multiball (it can still be started by the Left Ramp).\n\n The Cow \nYes that's right... TZ has a cow.  No I'm not telling you where, try\nthe spoilers.\n\nTips, Tricks... maybe even Strategies!\nThere are so many things to shoot for in TZ, it's insane.\nLast time I played TZ I had the ball trapped on the left flipper. The\nLeft Ramp was lit for Super Skill Shot; the Clock Target was lit for\nClock Millions; the Right Ramp was lit for Battle the Power; Lock was\nlit; the Slot Machine was active; and the Gumball Machine was lit.\nSIX shots, all of which are not easy and have their own rewards.  The\nstrategy in TZ is not to light something, then shoot it... TZ always\nhas something lit, and shooting it lights something else (or,\nusually, more than one thing).\n\nAs with TAF, there are several good, independent strategies -\nI haven't figured out yet which are the best.\n\n\nShoot for the Door Prizes.  Each one usually rakes in at least 20M,\nsometimes a lot more.  It's easy to relight the Piano and Slot Machine\n(just one Left Ramp shot) - they're not difficult shots either, and\nthe Piano is actually quite easy once you get the hang of it.  And\ngetting the ?, like getting Tour the Mansion, is a strategy in itself.\nShoot for multiball.  Simple enough; a lock is lit by a Left Ramp -\nRight Ramp combo, and once you get the Lock shot down, it isn't very\nhard to repeatedly get multiball.  Multiball itself is hard at first,\nbut not overly difficult.  In fact... a whole lot of things on TZ are\nhard to deal with at first, and become much easier once you know how.\nMultiball is especially worth your while to master; since successive\nJackpots get bigger and bigger, your score can climb very quick.\n(example: 4 Jackpots - 40, 50, 60, 70 - 220M.  Not bad.  Plus any 5M\ntargets you might pick up.)\nShoot for Powerball.  It never takes more than 3 Gumball shots to get\nthe Powerball to come out; the Gumball machine is relit quickly by the\ntwo ramps.  Powerball Mania is a very high-scoring round, and worth\ngoing for.\n\n\nNotice: ALL of these are made easier by the Left Ramp -> Right\nRamp combo.  This combo is the most important thing to MASTER in TZ;\nif you can shoot it successfully and repeatedly, the entire game\nopens up for you.\n\nQuick strategies for situations:\n\n\nball to upper left flipper, Piano unlit: shoot Power Payoff if that's\nlit, otherwise hold the flipper up for the Combo Hole.\nball to upper right flipper, Camera unlit: shoot Hitchhiker - adding a\nJet Bumper is paltry, and Hitchhiker gets you closer to Battle the\nPower.  Another possibility: shoot the upper left flipper!  There's a\ngood chance the ball will rattle around and into the Piano.  This is\nespecially good if the Jet Bumpers tend to drain the ball.  A third\nchoice is to shoot the upper left flipper, but then flick it when the\nball arrives.  With practice, this shot goes right up the Left Ramp!\nball to lower right flipper: shoot Dead End, Left Spiral, or Clock\nTarget if lit, otherwise go for one of the ramps.\n\n\nThe lower left flipper is probably the most important, since\nit can shoot so many things.  Of course, it's a Pat Lawlor game...\nall the flippers are important. :)  Just look at the 4-Way Combos -\nall four flippers get used.\n\nThere are quite a few strategies I've seen for defeating the\nPower.  The first is to just randomly flip - ok that's not a\nstrategy.  The second is to wait for the ball to fall below the\nmagnet, then flip it quickly - the ball should shoot past the magnet\nand toward the victory hole.  A third is the exact opposite - flip as\nthe ball is above the magnet; it then flies toward the magnet, off\nthe bottom wall, then past the magnet again and into the hole.  A\nfourth strategy, and the one I've seen work most often (50% maybe) is\nto flick one magnet on and off, build up some momentum, then release\nthe magnet and let the momentum carry the ball all over the place,\nhopefully up to the hole.  You may have limited success in defeating\nthe Power right away - the ball comes (usually) to the right magnet\nfirst.  Flip the right magnet just as the ball hits the bottom right\nwall, and it just might do the trick; it won't be worth terribly many\npoints, but it will award a free Door Prize.  Mike has had the most\nsuccess in defeating the Power - his strategy?  \"I don't know what the\nhell I'm doing\". :)  Good luck...\n\nIf you should get the Powerball in play, it's not worth\nshooting into Lock (unless you've never scored a double jackpot)...\nafter all, since the Jackpot is less than 100M, and since you have\nonly a 1/3 chance of shooting the double jackpot, the advantage of\nhaving Powerball going during multiball isn't that great.  Compared\nto the possibility of a huge Powerball Mania bonus, it's pretty\npaltry.\n\nOne thing that people at AMOA may find problematic is that the\nJet Bumpers have the tendency to send the ball screaming right\nbetween the flippers - and since the bumpers are so close by, there's\nno chance of reacting quickly enough to make a save.  This is exactly\nlike TAF, but it's more of a problem here since the ball goes into\nthe bumpers for every Hitchhiker shot (as many as 20-30 in a good\ngame).  Because of this, advanced players may want to avoid the Jet\nBumpers entirely; this was only a good strategy for me when I had the\nDoor handle lit - and then I missed the shot... FOUR times. :(\n\nSo TZ is another well-balanced Lawlor game with many\nstrategies for replays and high scores; as a follow-up to the\n(former?) #1 pinball game of all time (TAF), Twilight Zone is quite\namazing.  I think that TZ is better balanced than TAF - the\nhigh-scoring strategy in TAF was Tour the Mansion, then do it again.\nWith TZ there are many different ways to get the score way up there,\nand I especially like the increased value of multiball.\n\nOther Stuff\nThanks to Jon Deitch, Lyman Sheats, Kevin Martin, Mark\nPhaedrus, Josh Lehan, Brian Dominy, and Robert DeLoura\nfor making additional comments and\ncorrections.  Thanks to Felix Lee for the TZ playfield program.\n\nSlight Bragging Section: my best game is 1436M, best LITZ\n360M.  The Grand Champ score is somewhere near 2.5B, but it's\nwell-known that the guy who got it isn't any good at pinball, and\nhappens to work at the place... hmm.  He \"got\" a 560M LITZ, so it's\njust slightly suspect.  The best game I've seen so far was by Mark\nConant, at 1.6B.  Considering his highs on TAF and other games\n(deleted for sanity's sake), he'll go a lot higher than that.  If it's\nanything like TAF (it is), high scores will slowly build, and\nbuild...\n\nWell, hope you enjoyed this guided tour... of the Twilight Zone. :)\n\nBowen\n\n [[ The Spoilers are attached below - KJM ]] \n\nWarning warning: this list contains SPOILERS!

She says, \"Hee hee hee\"...\n\n Clock Chaos \nSix or seven Clock Target hits (very hard to do) generate the quote,\n\"Quit playin' with the clock!\", direct from FunHouse.\n\n ? = Lost in the Zone \nEvery ball is released from the Gumball Machine!\n\nEvery ball is released from the trough!\n\nEverything is lit!  Well - almost everything:\n\n\nPowerfield lit, defeating Power worth 50M (like Powerball Mania)\nTown Square Madness lit\nClock Millions lit\nSuper Slot lit\nHitchhiker shots worth 2M\nLeft Ramp shots worth 10M\nGreed targets lit\nDead End and Town Square lit (simultaneously?)\n\n\nBalls are kicked from the auto-plunger as long as the Clock continues\nto roll; once it strikes 12, everything stops IMMEDIATELY, all balls\ndrain, and it adds up your score (only points from LITZ round count).\nA good LITZ is worth upwards of 300M; the best LITZ gets on the high\nscore table.  If the Gumball Machine is disabled, LITZ will be only a\n3-ball multiball, else a 6-ball.  Bonus is awarded: x Hitchers, points\nfrom Odd Change (10M awarded automatically), points from Super Slot,\nfrom Town Square, from Greed, from Clock Millions, from Powerball\nMania, and from the Left Ramp.\n\n Extra Ball Buy-In \nIf you're greedy enough to buy an Extra Ball... :)  Well figure it out;\nthe quote is \"Grreeeeeeeedd\" right from TAF.\n\n The Cow \nBy request of someone anonymous from Ohio, who told me not to tell\npeople about cows, I'm not postin' it.

{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Twilight Zone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Twilight Zone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTWILIGHT ZONE\nEPISODE TIE-INS\n\n\nHere is\nthe most complete list I could develop of references to Twilight Zone episodes\nwhich appear on Bally's latest game.\nThere\nare still few questionable things in this list, so I would appreciate it if\nanyone could offer any corrections or fill in any blanks - I don't have all of\nthe episodes on tape, and I don't work for Bally.\n\nWARNING: THIS LIST CONTAINS TWILIGHT ZONE\nEPISODE SPOILERS!\nREAD NO FURTHER IF YOU PLAN TO EXPERIENCE\nTHE EPISODES YOURSELF\n\nON THE BACKGLASS\n\nRod Serling\n\nIf I\ndidn't start with Rod, I would be excommunicated as an official Zoner. The\nbackglass shows Rod Serling entering a Curio shop which houses many of the\nitems which appeared in episodes of the series. He is bathed from behind in\nbrilliant white light as he stands in the doorway of the shop. The Curio Shop\nitself is\nceilingless, exposing a field\nof stars (wonder what that ceiling fan is mounted to ...?). The name of the\ngame is written in the star field (there's no \"box topper\" this\ntime). My interpretation of the scene is that Rod has unlocked the door using\nthe key of imagination, giving him access to his own private playground.\n\nI will present\nthe items in two parts: those on the lefthand side of the shop (to Rod\nSerling's right) and items on the righthand side.\n\nLeft Side of Curio Shop\n\nTalky Tina Doll\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE LIVING\nDOLL (yes, it's Talk\"y\", not Talk\"ing\"). Telly Savalas\n(with a touch of hair!) plays a mean old stepfather who disapproves of the cost\nof the doll that his wife has purchased for her daughter. The doll always says\nthings like \"My name is Talky Tina and I love you very much\" to the\nlittle girl, but whenever Telly's alone with it, it says things like \"My\nname is Talky Tina and I don't think I like you\" which gradually escalates\nthroughout the episode as Telly tries to do away with the doll into \"My\nname is Talky Tina and I'm going to kill you!\". Eventually, he steps on it\nas he's descending the stairs, trips, and tumbles to his death. The doll comes\ntumbling afterward and lands next to him. When his wife sees what has happened,\nshe picks up the doll and it says \"My name is Talky Tina and you'd better\nbe nice to me!\". Is it any wonder that the first extra ball explodes when\nTina hands it to you?\n\nA Radio\n\nFrom\nthe episode STATIC.\nAn old bachelor digs out his radio when he's no longer happy with television.\nHe soon discovers that the radio picks up old programs, but it only happens when\nhe's alone with it. Eventually, the radio transforms him into a younger man.\nThis also explains why the radio is used in the animation for the Fast Lock\nround: Rod says \"It's time to tune into ... The Twilight Zone\" and we\nliterally begin receiving broadcasts of sound and music from previous Lawlor\ngames (in reverse order since we're going back through time) on the radio. As\nthe stations are switched (when a fast lock has not yet been achieved), we\nappropriately enough hear static. Once a fast lock is achieved, the station is\n\"locked in\" on the game (at least for the duration of the round).\n\nGumball Machine\n\nThis is\nnot derived from any episode - it's a Pat Lawlor and friends' original\ncontribution. The gumball machine is Twilight Zone-esque as it contains one\ngumball that's most unusual: the powerball. While I'm on the subject, ditto for\nthe powerfield: it has flippers that \"aren't there\" yet you can still\nmysteriously \"flip\". Artistic license taken by a creative genius.\n\nA Quarter Standing on its Edge\n\nFrom\nthe episode A PENNY\nFOR YOUR THOUGHTS. Dick York (of \"Bewitched\" fame) buys a\nnewspaper, casually tossing a quarter into the newsboy's coinbox. The coin\nlands on its edge and he finds that he can now read minds. At first this\nappears neat, but he soon learns that it's more trouble than it's worth, even\nto the point of losing his job at a bank (he warns the bank manager that a very\nprominent customer intends to take his business loan to the racetrack - and he\ngets canned at the mere suggestion of impropriety on the part of this\ncustomer). Ultimately, this is proven correct, however, and his job is\nrestored. As the manager is giving him his job back, a ladyfriend sends him\nthoughts that he should be more assertive, and he takes her advice: he lets the\nbank manager know that he knows about his mistress. The bank manager give him a\npromotion to head of accounting in return for his silence. On the way home, he\nbuys another paper from the same newsboy. He tosses another quarter in the box\n- and this one knocks the other quarter over (the newsboy had made a conscious\neffort to leave the first quarter standing all day). Instantly, his power to\nread minds disappears, and he's very grateful. Where else can you have so much\nfun for a quarter? Perhaps we should all toss our quarters before feeding them\ninto a Twilight Zone. Who knows? One might land on its edge and you'll be able\nto instantly know where all the cows, Easter eggs, and other assorted goodies\nare hidden. If you're not lucky enough to have any of your quarters land on\nedge, take heart: should any of them land on their heads or tails side, you'll\nbe instantly granted the power to read the mind of the average video game\nplayer.\n\nVictrola Record Player\n\nPossibly\nfrom the episode SOUNDS\nAND SILENCES (I don't have this one on tape). The main character is\nfascinated by noise, sitting at home playing recordings of navy battles for\nrelaxation! After his wife leaves him, he figures he can enjoy his noise all he\nwants to now. Except later that night, every little sound begins bothering him\n(clock ticking, etc.). The next day at work he suddenly yells at everyone to be\nquiet, but every little sound still bothers him. He finally sees a shrink who\ntells him it's all in his head. He goes home and spots his wife and\nconcentrates on reducing her voice to a small squeaking sound. The episode ends\nwith him realizing that everything now sounds like that!\n\nSkull and Bug\n\nFrom\nthe Episode QUEEN OF THE\nNILE. A journalist seeks to learn the secret behind a movie star's\n\"ageless\" beauty. She lives in a mansion decorated with props\nsupposedly from her first big picture called \"Queen of the Nile\". An\nolder woman, introduced as the starlet's mother, tells the journalist outside\nthat she is actually the starlet's daughter. After several dates don't sync\nwith her self-reported age, the journalist asks a Hollywood friend to pull his\nfile on the film. His friend asks \"which one?\" as there were two of\nthem made about thirty years apart. The photos of the two stars are remarkably\nidentical. When the journalist confronts the starlet with this information in\nher home, she slips him a knockout drug in his coffee. She then retrieves a\nlive Egyptian scarab from a hiding place behind one of her statutes. She uses\nthe scarab to drain all of the journalist's life energy (his skin eventually\ndisappears leaving a skull in its place, which cracks, crumbles, and turns to\ndust). She then holds the scarab to her breast which transfers the life energy\ninto herself, thus perpetuating her youth. She really IS a queen of the Nile.\nAs the episode closes, we see another young man calling on her. She's more like\nan Egyptian spider. This was probably the most gruesome ending shown on camera\nduring any episode of the series (there are a few episodes that have more\ngruesome endings, but Rod leaves their horror in the mind of the viewer.\nRemember, this was 1959-64 TV!).\n\nTelevision Set (partially obscured by skull)\n\nThere\nwas at least two episodes that featured a TV set which I recall. The first was A THING ABOUT MACHINES.\nA middle-aged high society gentleman named Finchley abhors machines of any\nkind. They of course can sense this and, when he's finally alone with them one\nday, they come after him. A typewriter spells \"Get out of here\nFinchley\", the television broadcasts an image of a Spanish dancer and she\nutters the same phrase, etc. The scene where his electric razor chases him down\nthe stairs is classic. He finally manages to get outside where he's pursued by\nhis car. He jumps into his pool and drowns. Wonder if Stephen King ever watched\nthis episode ... Christine ... Maximum Overdrive ... ??? The other episode (and\nthe one more likely to have propelled the TV set onto the backglass) was WHAT'S\nIN THE BOX? William Demarest (one of the two Uncle Charlies from My Three Sons)\ngets his TV repairman mad, so the repairman slaps the set back together and\nproclaims that it's fixed. But now the TV picks up a channel it could never\nreceive before - and this channel shows Demarest's character with his mistress.\nEventually it shows him knocking his wife out a window to her death. Worried\nthat his wife will find out about his mistress on the TV, he decides to confess\nto her about having a mistress. But his wife isn't in a forgiving mood. They\nargue, and sure enough he knocks her out the window.\n\nSmall Featureless Mannequin/Artist's Model\n\nFrom\none of the many opening credit sequences. Fourth season, I think.\n\nLife Preserver from the Queen of Glasgow\n\nFrom\nthe episode JUDGMENT\nNIGHT. Nehemiah Persoff stars as a German passenger aboard the British\nSteamer S. S. Queen of Glasgow in the year 1942. He has absolutely no idea how\nhe got on board. But somehow he knows that something's going to happen in the\nwee hours of the early morning. And it does - a U-boat surfaces and torpedoes\nthe ship; the crew of the U-boat shoots the survivors. The captain of the\nU-boat is discovered to be Persoff's character himself, who has been condemned\nto a timeloop in which he's forced to relive his evil deed forever.\n\nRobby the Robot\n\nRobby\nappeared in several episodes including UNCLE SIMON and THE BRAIN CENTER AT\nWHIPPLE'S. In UNCLE\nSIMON, a niece is looking after her uncle whom she doesn't really like very\nmuch (but since he's very rich and she's his only heir, she manages to put up\nwith him). Finally, she sends uncle tumbling down a flight of stairs to his\ndeath. But the conditions of his will are such that she gets the estate only if\nshe agrees to look after his latest invention: a robot. Of course, the robot is\nquickly found to have her uncle's personality, mannerisms, and all of his other\ntraits that she detests. In\nTHE BRAIN CENTER AT WHIPPLE'S, Richard Deacon (Mel on the old Dick van Dyke\nShow) plays Mr. Whipple, an insensitive factory manager who puts the majority\nof his employees out of work by replacing them with robots. Ultimately, the\nrobots begin voicing the same complaints which the human workers had, so the\ncompany's board of directors replaces Whipple with a robot! It was obvious that\nRobby had further developed his method acting skills as evidenced by the depth\nof his characterizations. His role in Forbidden Planet was clearly just a\nspringboard to bigger and better things.\n\nRocketship\n\nI'm pretty certain that this is from the episode I SHOT AN ARROW INTO THE AIR,\nbut this is one of the episodes I don't have on tape and I haven't seen it in\nyears. I believe a rocketship named The Arrow malfunctions after launch and\ncrash lands on some barren planet. With little in the way of water and survival\nsupplies left, the crew commences killing each other. Just before the second to\nlast crewmember dies, he crawls to the top of a hill and scratches a message in\nthe sand. This is finally discovered by the last crewmember left alive to mean\nelectrical wires - the ship really crashed landed on earth in an Arizona\ndesert.\n\nAn Invader\n\nFrom\nthe Episode THE\nINVADERS. Here's a real Zone classic. Agnes Moorhead (another Bewitched\nstar) is an older woman alone in her bleak farmhouse. She hears strange noises\ncoming from the roof, so she goes to investigate. There she spots a flying\nsaucer and soon two tiny, pudgy aliens emerge who only make/speak in mechanical\nbabbling noises. The aliens begin terrorizing her in her house with their tiny\nray guns (which causes her skin to blister horribly). One of them even manages\nto cut into her hand with one of the woman's own kitchen knives. She finally\nbashes one of them to death and throws it into a box that she finally tosses\ninto her raging fireplace. Grabbing an axe, she pursues the other one back to\nthe spaceship. As she begins chopping the spaceship to pieces, we hear a\nmessage being broadcast in English from the creature inside warning its home\nplanet not send any more ships to this world because a race of giants lives\nhere. As the ship is further destroyed by blows from the axe, the camera zooms\nin on the ship revealing the words \"U. S. Air Force\" - the ship is\nreally from earth and the invaders are actually humans in spacesuits! One of\nthe neatest things about this episode is that there are some extremely subtle\nclues as to the ending sprinkled throughout: normal everyday objects don't look\nquite right (but they don't look so strange that they arouse initial\nsuspicions), and the woman never speaks (she just makes grunts and strange\nsounds when searching for the aliens, in pain, or swinging the axe). This\nepisode bears many repeat viewings - it's brilliantly done. It's quite\nappropriate that these little guys get involved in many aspects of the game\nincluding delivering extra balls, winding the clock, etc. as they are, after\nall, inquisitive by nature and enjoy pinball very much.\n\nThe Pyramid with the Eye\n\nThis\nwas another item that did not appear in any episode. It turns out that this was\nsomething neat-looking that artist John Youssi threw in on the cabinet artwork.\nPat Lawlor thought it was pretty cool and this lead directly to its appearance\non the powerfield as well. My original conjecture was that it represented GREED\n(being from the back of the U. S. dollar bill) and that it usually popped up on\nthe game in conjunction with that theme (and greed was certainly a theme which\noccurred frequently in TZ episodes).\n\nLarge Wooden Spoon and Curved Knives\n\nThe\nscale of this one fooled me, I must admit, and I had to ask someone which\nepisode they were from. He said it's the utensils used by Agnes Moorhead to go\nafter the pesky aliens in THE INVADERS (see\nabove). Once he told me that, it made sense; I guess I was deceived by the\nparadox of scale employed by artist John Youssi. Since the invaders are really\nhuman, they should in theory be about the same size as Rod Serling since many\nof the objects on the backglass are scaled to Rod as the human yardstick. But\nthis still doesn't quite explain the utensils, which are clearly large enough\nto slice, dice, and batter someone of Rod's size in the picture, making the\ninvaders and their flying saucer the victims of severe downsizing. I'm not\ncomplaining, mind you - I should have been evaluating each object independent of\nrelative scale. It's kind of neat that I was tripped up by such an obvious one.\n\nMaple Street Sign\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE\nMONSTERS ARE DUE ON MAPLE STREET, another Zone classic. A strange sound is\nheard flying overhead one evening on Maple Street, U.S.A. and, shortly\nthereafter, the residents notice that there's no electrical power whatsoever.\nNo phones, no lights, nothing. Even battery operated stuff doesn't work, which\nmeans they can't start their cars to go for help. As the neighbors begin\ngetting concerned, little Tommy relates a story from a comic book he once read\nof how invading aliens usually send a team to the planet they intend to conquer\nseveral years in advance - the aliens assume human form and take up residence,\ngathering intelligence for the armada to come. Pretty soon everyone's trying to\nfigure out who the aliens are among them. Despite the best efforts of Claude\nAkins (in his pre-Sheriff Lobo days) as the neighbor with the most common sense\ntrying to keep the peace, paranoia soon reigns supreme. The petty quirks and\nidiosyncrasies which all neighbors have are suddenly thrust under the\nmicroscope (one guy has trouble sleeping so he's often spotted outside in the\nearly morning hours gazing at the stars - \"what are you looking at in the\nsky?\"; Claude has a ham radio in his basement - \"sending messages to\nthem aliens?\", etc.). Compounding the problem is that several\nunexplainable coincidences occur during all of this (one guy's car suddenly\nstarts itself when no one's near it and then stops a few seconds later, the\nlights suddenly go on just in one other guy's house, etc). Eventually, one guy\neven shoots and kills one of his neighbors because he thinks it's one of them\nmonsters they've been expecting coming down the street (they'd asked him to\nwalk over to the next neighborhood to see if the power was on over there). They\nfinally all freak out and start running around, throwing rocks, and shooting\neach other in a frantic riot. As the camera pulls back, we're looking down on\nMaple Street from a remote hillside. There stands a couple of aliens outside of\ntheir spaceship. All this time it has been them controlling the power on Maple\nStreet. They note that except for very minor details, that this is the way all\nhumans react when confronted with such a strange situation (they've apparently\nconducted similar experiments elsewhere on earth). When they do invade, they\nplan to let the humans destroy themselves. This is most likely the inspiration\nfor the Town Square Madness round on the game as well.\n\nCasey's Uniform and Cap\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE MIGHTY\nCASEY. Jack Warden is saddled with the job of coaching the losingest team\nin baseball, the Cleveland Indians (OK, OK - they were renamed the Zephyrs and\nrelocated to Hoboken for the show). An inventor presents the coach with Casey,\na robot who can pitch a baseball with missile-like speed and accuracy. The team\nbegins doing very well, but when Casey gets hit in the noggin with one of his\nown pitches compliments of an opposing player's bat, he's hospitalized. When\nthe doctor examines him, he finds that Casey has no pulse! (they almost get\naway with the scam, but the doc catches on just before leaving). Immediately,\nthe Baseball Commissioner rules that Casey cannot play because the rules say\nthat a team is made up of nine men and Casey's not a man because he has no\nheart. The inventor asks the Commissioner if Casey would be eligible again if\nhe could install a heart. The Commissioner says yes - and a few days later\nCasey's back in the lineup after being heart-certified (the doc just listens to\nCasey's chest, hears the appropriate thumping sounds and says he's legit now -\nCasey could have just swallowed a mechanical alarm clock to have passed that\ntest). But the heart is soon discovered to be all too real: his Patriot Missile\nprecision pitching is quickly found to have degenerated into SCUD duds during\nhis first game back. The Zephyrs lose it big time. When asked what happened,\nCasey replies that he just couldn't bring himself to strike out those batters\nbecause he figured it would hurt their feelings. At the end of the episode, the\ninventor takes Casey away (presumably to live a more human-like life now), but\nhe leaves Casey's blueprints with the coach. After a few moments of thought,\nthe coach gets an inspiration and hurriedly chases after the inventor. Rod's\nclosing narration indicates that the Zephyrs were moved to the west coast a few\nyears later where they wound up winning several pennants, primarily because of\ntheir excellent pitching staff. Perhaps the coach made up a few more and had\nthem each swallow an alarm clock.\n\nCannon\n\nI think\nthis is from one of the Civil War episodes: either STILL VALLEY, THE PASSERBY, or THE 7TH IS MADE UP OF\nPHANTOMS. In STILL\nVALLEY, a Confederate soldier comes across a town filled with Union\nsoldiers frozen in their tracks - alive, but motionless. He runs across an old\nman who's used a book of witchcraft to cast this spell on them. After the old\nman proves it to him (by casting the spell on him temporarily), the old man\ngives the book of witchcraft to the Confederate soldier who takes it back to\ncamp. He plans to use it to freeze the entire Union Army. But when he begins\nreading the spell, he notices that he has to invoke the name of Satan. He\ndecides that if the Confederacy's cause is to die, he'd rather see it die on\nhallowed ground - and pitches the book of witchcraft onto the campfire. In THE PASSERBY, a\nnumber of people are found wandering down a road in the aftermath of the Civil\nWar. A confederate soldier is confronted by a woman who believes her husband is\ndead. When a blinded Union soldier stops to rest, she shoots him at close range\nwith rifle - and it has no effect. They begin to suspect that everyone walking\nthe road is dead. Eventually, her husband shows up and says it's true. She\nrefuses to believe it, but her husband says he must continue down the road.\nPretty soon she sees the last man coming down the road is Abraham Lincoln - and\nthus convinced, runs after her husband. Didn't an episode of M*A*S*H borrow\nthis idea for one of its episodes (at least in part)? In THE 7TH IS MADE UP OF\nPHANTOMS, a couple of soldiers from a platoon engaged in wargames near the\nsite of Little Big Horn eventually join the real battle of Little Big Horn\n(this one's just a sketchy memory, sorry).\n\nA Pile of Books\n\n\nAn unnamed book by ROD SERLING\n\nMost likely a generic or unproduced script.\n\nREQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT\n\nOne of Serling's first\nhighly-acclaimed scripts which aired on Playhouse 90 several years before he\nundertook The Twilight Zone. Serling was a boxer himself at one time, and\nundoubtedly carried his experiences with the sport into Requium and several\nboxing-themed episodes of The Twilight Zone including both STEEL and THE BIG TALL WISH. In the\nepisode STEEL, Lee\nMarvin stars as a boxing manager of the future: managing robot competitors. But\nwhen his own robot, Battling Maxo, breaks down before the fight, Marvin takes\nhis place in the ring in disguise. Although he gets soundly whipped by the\nother robot, the promoters don't notice the switcheroo and pay Marvin the loser's\npart of the purse - which is just enough money for him to repair Maxo. In THE\nBIG TALL WISH, a boxer with a broken hand wins his match anyway when a little\nboy makes a \"big tall wish\" because he believes in the boxer. The\nboxer doesn't believe he won because of the wish - and quickly finds himself\nback in the ring, flat on his back, and being counted out.\n\nMATHESON 1962\n\nPerhaps it symbolizes an unproduced\nscript from Richard Matheson, one of the key writers on the show besides\nSerling.\n\nAn illegible title followed by C. J. LAWLOR\n\nObviously a dedication from Pat\nLawlor, but I can't identify C. J. specifically.\n\nMY TRAVELS WITH RUDY\nby P. L.\n\nLawlor's travelogue with some dummy.\n\nL. M. E. 1962\n\nAnother insider initials thing. Could\nthe ending 'E' be for Estes (Ted Estes, game software) here or below?\n\nC. F. D., E. R. D., V.  L. K., and E. A. E.\n\nMore insider initials. Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?\n\nBEAUMONT\n\nPerhaps an unproduced script of\nCharles Beaumont, the other major writer beside Matheson and Serling.\n\n\nA Monster's Head (with tag attached reading 3/62)\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE\nFUGITIVE. A grandfatherly gentleman who can shape shift is being pursued by\ntwo other men. He tells a young girl who wears a leg brace that he's actually a\nfugitive from outer space. The old man heals the little girl's leg, but his\npursuers capture the little girl and make her deathly ill. The old man returns\nand makes her well again. It becomes clear that the old man is not a fugitive\nfrom the law, but rather the benevolent ruler of an alien world - his two\npursuers are actually his subjects dispatched to convince him to come back. The\nlittle girl wants to go too, but the two men won't let her. When the old man is\npermitted a few seconds alone with the little girl to say goodbye, the two men\nare suddenly confronted by two little girls who are identical in every respect.\nSince they can't tell them apart, they agree to take both with them. This also\nallows the girl to permanently escape from her domineering stepmother she lives\nwith. The monster head was one of the characters the old man transformed into\nand the tag indicates that the head was used (that the episode was originally\naired) in March of 1962.\n\nKing Nine Flight Jacket (with tag attached reading 4/62)\n\nFrom\nthe episode KING NINE\nWILL NOT RETURN. The King Nine, a World War II bomber gets hit while on a\nbombing run and crash lands in the north African desert. One of the officers\nregains consciousness and begins looking around for the rest of his crew. He\ncomes across one of their graves, sees mirages of his men, and sees strange\naircraft making weird sounds flying overhead: jets! He finally collapses from\nexhaustion and wakes up in a hospital bed in modern times. Many years before it\nseems he got sick and was not able to make King Nine's last flight as he was\nscheduled to. He's had a bad guilt complex about it ever since he heard about\nit being shot down. At least he was only hallucinating about being there. But\nthat doesn't explain where all the sand came from which he finds in his shoes!\nThe date on the tag is mysterious, since the episode was originally aired in\nSeptember of 1960. Anyone know the significance of this date?\n\nThe Box\naddressed to Jodi with the thing tagged \"Simon\"\n\nAgain\nfrom UNCLE SIMON. The\nthing inside seems to be one of Robby the Robot's hands. I don't know who Jodi\nis as there was no Jodi in the episode. Another dedication, perhaps.\n\nSpiral Calendar with Knife Impaled into February 12, 1964\n\nI'm\npretty certain that this is the date the series was officially canceled by CBS,\nalthough the remaining unseen episodes continued to be shown until the season\nconcluded that May or June.\n\nTreasure Map\n\nI've\ndrawn a blank here - I can't place this one. I'm fresh out of theories, too.\nAnyone?\n\nPicture of Airplane and Dinosaurs\n\nFrom\nthe episode ODYSSEY OF\nFLIGHT 33. Flight 33 enroute to New York from London catches a tail wind of\nmammoth velocity. It pushes the plane through a shock wave. When the plane\ndescends, they see New York (or at least what will be New York) as a wilderness\narea with dinosaurs roaming about! They have somehow broken through a time\nbarrier. They figure their only hope is to pick up that tail wind again. They\ndo, but when they raise the tower in New York, the controller claims he doesn't\nknow what radar is. Further inspection of the landscape reveals that the 1939\nWorld's Fair is in progress - they haven't come back far enough in time. As the\nepisode closes, the plane is running out of fuel and is making a final attempt\nto catch that tail wind.\n\nPicture\nof Pyramid-like things on a Landscape\n\nFrom\none of the opening credits sequences (and LITZ).\n\nNote of\nDedication\nTo\nD.A.D. from L.E.D.\n\nWe all know who L.E.D. is (right? a major TZ software\nengineer). Isn't it cool that D.A.D. turns out to be his father's initials? But\ndon't think for a second that this \"initials as apropos acronyms\"\nthing is widespread. My initials are B.A.R. and I couldn't spot any meaning\nwhatsoever in them. Matter of fact, I was just discussing that very same issue\nwith my sister Victoria Catherine Rudolph (the movie rental store manager) last\nnight when we dropped by a local pub at my insistence. We both concluded that\nthere's just no way that your initials can have any influence on the direction\nof your life at birth.\n\nAutographed\nPicture of Casey\n\nAgain\nfrom THE MIGHTY CASEY.\nThis episode must have been another one of their favorites.\n\nThe\nSwords and the Calvary 7 Flag\n\nAlso\nfrom THE 7TH IS MADE\nOF PHANTOMS (see above). It's also possible that one of these swords is\nactually from THE\nENCOUNTER. In this episode, Neville Brand (in real life a highly decorated\nWorld War II veteran) and George Takei (in his pre-Lt. Sulu/Federation days)\nstar as two people who must deal with feelings left over from WWII. Takei is a\ngardener who drops in on Brand, who's cleaning his attic. Brand's character is\na bigot; Takei's is a Japanese-American. Brand comes across a sword which he\ntook from a Japanese officer he killed in the war. Takei reads the inscription:\n\"the sword will avenge me\". Whenever Takei holds the sword, he gets\nthe urge to kill Brand! After several close calls, they both decide they'd\nbetter leave the attic. But the door (which has no lock) is inexplicably jammed\n- they are trapped. Further dialogue between the two reveals that Brand's\ncharacter didn't take the sword from a dead soldier - he killed the Japanese\nsoldier after he had surrendered to him! We also learn that Takei's character's\nfather was a traitor who guided the Japanese attack force into Pearl Harbor.\nBrand tells Takei that he has nothing left to live for - he wants Takei to kill\nhim (he's lost his job, etc. recently). A scuffle ensues, with Brand\naccidentally falling on the sword and dying. Takei picks up the sword, which\ncauses him to yell \"Banzai!\" and leap out the attic window to his\ndeath as well. The episode concludes with the door gliding silently open. I\nthink this episode was only screened once. It did stir up quite a controversy\n(there were lots of anti-Japanese slurs made by Brand's character, and there is\nconclusive proof that there was NO traitor at Pearl Harbor, for example).\n\nThree\nStrange-Looking Masks\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE MASKS.\nA bitter, rich, elderly gentleman confined to a wheelchair senses that he's\nabout to pass away. He asks that his relatives (and future heirs) remain with\nhim until he dies. As this takes place during Mardi Gras time in New Orleans,\nthe old man distributes a mask to each of the four of them (so why only 3 on\nthe backglass?). The masks are hideous things, made by a Cajun. Each mask\nstands for the face of an inner-self (cruelty, vanity, etc.). The old man makes\neach one of his heirs wear the appropriate mask (in his opinion) until\nmidnight. Failure to do so will result in disinheritance. The old man dons a\nskull (death's head) mask for himself. The heirs think this is all silly and\nrepeatedly ask for an end to this game so they can take off their masks, but\nthe old man refuses. When midnight rolls around, the old man is discovered to\nhave died. The heirs then remove their masks - and find that their own faces\nhave been permanently deformed into the grotesqueness of the mask they were\nwearing!\n\nThe\nSlot Machine\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE FEVER.\nMr. and Mrs. Franklin Gibbs win a trip to Las Vegas after Mrs. Gibbs enters a\njingle-writing contest. She has a \"let's have a little fun gambling\"\nattitude, but her husband wants no part of it - he won't even let her plunk a\nfew small coins into a slot machine. As events unfold, a drunk staggers by and\ngives Mr. Gibbs a silver dollar and ultimately forces him to play it in a\nmachine over Gibbs' protests. Gibbs pulls the handle and wins twenty more\nsilver dollars. As he's taking them back to his room, he thinks he hears\nsomeone calling him (saying his name \"Franklin!\" in a raspy voice)\nbut he dismisses this. Back in the room, he tells his wife that no good can\ncome of money won in this evil game, so he tells her he's going to take it back\ndownstairs and play it until he loses it all. What an understatement. Every\ntime he thinks about stopping, he finds it's the slot machine calling his name\n- and it keeps taunting him to play. His wife discovers him downstairs, after\nhaving cashed many personal checks with nothing to show for it. He inserts his\nlast silver dollar, hoping that the \"long overdue\" payoff will drop\nwhen he pulls the handle. Instead, the machine jams, refusing to play anymore.\nGibbs goes ballistic, finally knocking the machine over. Defeated, he returns\nto his room where he begins hallucinating that the slot machine is after him.\nHe hears it repeatedly calling \"Franklin! FRANKLIN!!!\". He opens the\ndoor and sees it standing there. His wife sees nothing. Franklin winds up\njumping out the window to his death, driven mad by the machine. As the episode\ncloses, a single silver dollar rolls up beside him and spins to a stop \u2013 the\nmachine is now outside apparently satisfied enough to return Franklin's last\ndollar.\n\nRifle\n(hanging directly above Rod in the doorway)\n\nCould\nbe from any of the Civil War episodes mentioned above or it might also be Cliff\nRobertson's rifle from the episode A HUNDRED YARDS OVER THE RIM.\nRobertson stars as a pioneer heading west in the late 1840's-1850's. His family\nmembers are sick and desperately in need of medical help. He goes over the top\nof a hill and encounters modern highway. Turning around, his wagons and his\nfamily have vanished. After being charged by a monster (a truck), he falls to\nthe ground and his rifle accidentally goes off, firing into his arm. He wanders\ninto a diner where the owners treat his arm and give him some penicillin pills.\nRobertson eventually spies a calendar dated 1961. He learns from an\nencyclopedia that his son is destined to grow up to be a famous doctor. The\nowners become convinced that Robertson is a nut case and they call the sheriff\nto take him away. But Robertson escapes, crosses back over the hill into his\nown time where he uses the pills to treat his family. In his hurry to depart,\nhe left his rifle behind in 1961 (pardon the time paradox) and it now looks\nlike an aged antique!\n\nRight Side of Curio Shop\n\nE=MC^2\n\nFrom\nthe opening credits,\ncourtesy of a Mr. Einstein. In the opening credits of one season, it rolled\nacross the screen when Rod got to the \"... a dimension of mind ...\"\npart of his narrative.\n\nA Boxing Card\n\nAgain\nfrom STEEL or THE BIG TALL WISH.\n\nDaily Times with Headline \"Aliens Land Today\"\n\nFrom\nthe episode TO SERVE MAN.\nThis is perhaps *THE* all-time classic episode of the Twilight Zone. The synopsis\nof this episode is postponed briefly as there's a more appropriate tie-in of it\ncoming up shortly.\n\nSanta Claus' Cap\n\nFrom\nthe Episode NIGHT OF THE\nMEEK. Art Carney (Ed Norton, from the old Honeymooners show with Jackie\nGleason) stars as a department store Santa Claus who shows up for work drunk on\nChristmas Eve and is promptly fired. Stumbling about in an alley (still dressed\nin his ragged Santa suit), he comes across a magic sack which can produce any\ngift asked for. He quickly goes about giving away presents to any and all,\nuntil he runs into a policeman. The cop assumes that all of the gifts must be\nstolen, so he runs Carney's Santa Claus in to the police station. Waiting for\nhim at the station is Carney's old boss, who figures the gifts were stolen from\nthe department store. His old boss begins removing items from the bag\nrapid-fire, without actually looking at them, as \"evidence\" of the\ncrime. But what he's really getting out of the bag is trash! Old tins cans,\netc. He wakes up when he pulls a scrawny cat from the bag!! When Carney\nexplains that the bag is magic, his old boss challenges him to produce a bottle\nof rare-vintage brandy. The bag provides it! Carney is freed and resumes passing\nout presents to everyone he can. But at midnight, the bag stops working. A\nstreet bum points out to Carney that he didn't take a present for himself.\nCarney replies that he only wishes that he could do this every year. Rounding a\ncorner into an alley, he comes across an elf, a sleigh, and some reindeer \u2013\nwhich are ready to take him to the North Pole! A very Merry Christmas for him\nindeed!!!\n\nA Helmet from a Spacesuit\n\nThis\nlooks like the one used in THE PARALLEL (and\npossibly some others). Steve Forrest (was S.W.A.T. the last show he did?) is a\nMajor in the [early 1960's] U.S. space program. While in his space capsule\norbiting the earth, he disappears from all radar screens. He wakes up in a\nhospital only to find that a number of things he clearly remembers are no\nlonger the same. In fact, he's now a Colonel and no one can understand why he's\nclaiming someone named John Kennedy is President of the United States! After\nskimming a set of encyclopedias, he determines that he's in a parallel\nuniverse. Examination of the space capsule reveals that it's not the one the\nlocal scientists recall sending up (close, but not the same). When Forrest\nbolts toward the capsule, he finds himself back in orbit, ready to splash down.\nOnce back in the \"real\" world, Forrest relates his story. This is\nconsidered a delusion by his superiors (even though was out of radar contact\nfor several hours). As the episode ends, they discover that an unidentified space\ncraft was picked up on radar for about a minute, along with a message from a\n*Colonel* with Forrest's character's name!\n\nAn Airplane\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE ARRIVAL.\nAn airplane lands with absolutely no one on board. An FAA (U.S. Federal\nAviation Administration) investigator who supposedly has a perfect\ninvestigative record is called in. The passenger list sounds familiar to him,\nbut he can't recall from where. His associates don't agree on any of the\nplane's details: call letters, colors, etc. are all debated. The investigator\nconvinces himself that the plane is not really there. To prove this, he thrusts\nhis hand into one of its spinning propellers! Suddenly, the plane and his\nassociates vanish. He finds his associates back in the control room, with no\nmemory of the phantom plane. Just then he remembers: the same flight number\ndisappeared many years earlier and it was never found. There was one case he\nDID NOT solve, and here it is - haunting him.\n\nMore Books\n\n\nA.J.Y., L.E.D.\n\nThere be them initials again.\n\nHOUGHTON\n\nA reference to Buck Houghton, long\ntime producer of the Twilight Zone episodes.\n\nTO SERVE MAN\n\nAh yes - the moment you've all been\nwaiting for!!! I almost missed this on first inspection of the backglass (it's\ndark in that tucked-away corner of that shelf) and was very pleased to find it.\nRichard Kiel (later Jaws in the James Bond flicks THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and\nMOONRAKER) stars as the Kanamits, a benevolent race of aliens who land on earth\nwith the sole intention of serving man (the Kanamits are nine feet tall with\nbulging bald heads - and Kiel played all of them!). The Kanamits provide a cure\nfor cancer, show man how to triple the productivity of his crops, offer a force\nfield which can be used to protect man from invasion, and provide an\nultra-efficient source of power. One of the Kanamits leaves a book at the\nUnited Nations following a speech (well, not really a \"speech\" since\nthe Kanamits communicate with humans strictly via telepathy). Since the book is\nin Kanamit, U.S. decoding experts are set to work on it. The work proves\ndifficult, but eventually they manage to at least decipher the title: TO SERVE MAN. Given how\nwell everything is going on earth, they do seem to be interested in man's\nwelfare. There are some who still don't trust them, but they are certainly in\nno position to argue with success. The Kanamits set up an interstellar shuttle\nservice to their home planet, so humans can vacation there as they please. With\nno more wars or problems at home, one of the top decoding experts books his own\ntrip to the Kanamit's planet. A lady waiting in line relates how her sister wrote\nback from the Kanamit's planet saying how much she enjoys it there. Just as the\ndecoding expert is boarding, one of his associates rushes up in a frenzy. She\nscreams at him not to get on the ship - they've deciphered another part of the\nbook: TO SERVE MAN is a *cookbook*! But she's too late - and a Kanamit shoves\nhim aboard. As I said, a real classic. It's such a classic that the Simpson's\nHalloween Special several years ago poked fun at the notion of \"cooking\nhumans\" with a book whose title kept changing as layers of dust were blown\noff of it from \"HOW TO COOK HUMANS\" to \"HOW TO COOK FOR\nHUMANS\" to \"HOW TO COOK FORTY HUMANS\" to \"HOW TO COOK FOR\nFORTY HUMANS\" (and I can't recall if it went farther than that!).\n\n\nSeveral Packages\n\nThe\npackages are perhaps bundles of things/ideas which were used in several\nepisodes. Each one has a name written on the outside. The four packages are\naddressed to:\n\n Mr. Frisby\n In reference to the episode HOCUS-POCUS AND FRISBY.\nMr. Frisby is a loud-mouthed braggart who unwittingly convinces a couple of\naliens that he's a prime human specimen, so they abduct him with the intention\nof displaying him in their zoo. When Frisby can't undo his bragging, he settles\ndown to play his harmonica \u2013 which emits tones that put the aliens to sleep!\nFrisby escapes, returning to a surprise birthday party in his honor at his\ncountry general store. When he tries to tell everyone at the party about his\nexperience, they dismiss it as yet another one of Frisby's tall tales.\n\n Mr. Bemis\n In reference to Mr. Henry Bemis,\nthe bank teller played by Burgess Meredith in TIME ENOUGH AT LAST.\nAnother Zone classic. Mr. Bemis loves nothing more in the world than reading.\nHe's constantly reading anything and everything he can get his hands on. He is\nso preoccupied with his his desire to read that he reads while on the job,\nwhile on his lunch hour, and whenever his wife isn't present in the room with\nhim at home. His obsession does get in the way, however. He short changes bank\ncustomers and just generally doesn't pay much attention to what he's doing at\nthe moment (when it is not reading). One day when he\nretreats to the bank vault to read on his lunch hour (as per\nhis usual routine), a tremendous force (accompanied by a tremendous sound)\nrocks the building. When it's all over, he ventures out to discover that the\nbomb has hit - and he's apparently the last person on earth. He ponders ending\nit all, but suddenly comes upon the wreckage of the town library. Most of the\nbooks are strewn about, but nevertheless still in reasonable condition. He\nspends several days sorting the books into piles which he plans to read on a\nyear-by-year basis. When at long last he picks up the first book (he now has\ntime enough at last), his glasses slide off his nose and shatter on the ground.\n\n Mr. Whipple\n Another reference to THE BRAIN CENTER AT\nWHIPPLE'S.\n\n Mr. Dingle\n In reference to Mr. Luther Dingle,\nfrom the episode MR.\nDINGLE, THE STRONG. In yet another Twilight Zone role, Burgess Meredith\nplays Mr. Dingle, a mild-mannered vacuum cleaner salesman who is suddenly given\nthe strength of several hundred men by a couple of visiting Martians. Dingle's\nmanner changes as he begins performing strength stunts for his friends.\nEventually drawing the attention of the media, he plans to lift an entire\nbuilding. But the Martians are displeased by his foolish use of the power they\ngave him, so they take it away. Mr. Dingle becomes a laughingstock. As the\nMartians depart, they encounter two more aliens (Venusians, if I remember)\nlooking to conduct an intelligence experiment with a Tellurian (Earthling, that\nis). The Martians naturally suggest Dingle. The new aliens hit Dingle with a\nray that boosts his intelligence several hundred-fold. Here we go again ...\n\n\nVentriloquist's\nDummy named Willy with Road Trunk and Costumes\n\nThis\none's from the episode THE\nDUMMY (OK, I know: vents call them \"figures\", but what kind of a\ntitle would that have been?). Cliff Robertson's the drunken vent who thinks his\nfigure is alive and a bit on the evil side. He obtains another figure (which\ndoesn't give him the willies, so to speak) and when their act is a hit, Cliff\nlocks Willy in his trunk, probably forever. But after hearing Willy's voice and\nseeing what appears to be his shadow on the wall, Cliff unlocks the trunk and\nsmashes the figure inside to pieces. He realizes too late that he's just\ndestroyed the NEW figure, not Willy. Willy lets out a spine-chilling laugh. The\nnext time we see their act, Willy is now the human ventriloquist and Cliff has\ntransformed into the dummy! It is Willy who is holding the now infamous\nbutton/joystick with coiled cord thing which made\nprevious\nappearances on Lawlor's other backglasses like WHIRLWIND and FUNHOUSE. It looks\nmore like a button than a joystick to me. Was Lawlor ever a contestant on\nJeopardy? At the 1993 Pinball Show in Arizona, a member of the audience asked\nhim point-blank what this thing was and what it symbolized. He wouldn't say\nanything other than that we can expect to see it again. It's definitely a\nWilliams/Bally\nin-joke of some sort. Lawlor did begin his career as a video game designer, so\nit could be homage to that as well.\n\nA Bottle of Professor Daemon's Love Potion\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE CHASER.\nA man is obsessed with winning the love of a young lady who hardly notices him.\nHe buys a love potion from a curious \"professor\" named A. Daemon.\nWhen he slips her the potion, it works to the extreme. After they've been\nmarried for a few months, the man can't wait to get away from her - she's\ngiving him too much attention! He resolves to kill her by buying another potion\nfrom the professor, one that leaves no traces. But just as he's about to give\nit to her in a drink, she reveals that she's pregnant - and he drops the glass.\nThe professor, who's been sitting outside on their patio promptly vanishes\nafter blowing a heart-shaped smoke ring. I don't know about you, but if I ran\nacross some weirdo named A. Daemon, I would think twice about buying *anything*\nfrom him. I also make it a rule to avoid wandering into spooky old houses when\npeople suddenly begin vanishing from town. I'm not paranoid (REALLY - I'm\nNOT!!!), just cautious.\n\nA Player Piano\n\nFrom\nthe episode A PIANO IN\nTHE HOUSE. A theater critic visits an antique store looking for a player\npiano to give to his wife as a birthday present. When the normally sour clerk\ndemonstrates it, he becomes wonderfully sentimental. The instant the music\nstops, he goes back to being his old self. The critic buys it and has it\ndelivered. As he tries various music rolls in the piano, he discovers that his\nbutler is actually happy and carefree behind his serious appearance, that his\nwife really doesn't like him, and that a playwright has had an affair with his\nwife. He decides to use the piano on the rest of the party guests later that\nnight. A portly woman is revealed to have dreams of being a beautiful girl and\na delicate snowflake. She is utterly humiliated by this, but the critic is\nenjoying his power over the partygoers. He tells them that he plans to conjure\nup a devil, and hands his wife a roll to put on the piano while he refreshes\nhis drink. But she switches the rolls and the resulting piece causes the critic\nto reveal *his* innermost self. He's discovered to be nothing more than a\nspoiled brat who can't stand to see other people get more attention than\nhimself. His guests walk out on him, including his wife who leaves with the\nplaywright. He begins demolishing the place in a tantrum as the episode closes.\n\nA Pair of Boxing Gloves\n\nAgain\nfrom STEEL or THE BIG TALL WISH.\n\nA Tyrannosaurus Rex\n\nHmmm\n... ODYSSEY OF FLIGHT\n33 is the most closely related episode I can remember, but I don't recall a\nTyrannosaurus Rex in that episode (a Brachiosaurus, yes - but not a\nTyrannosaurus Rex). Seems that T-Rex's are popping up on pingames everywhere as\nof late for one reason or another. And I know for a fact that it's not BARNEY -\nBarney's purple and has had significant cosmetic dental work.\n\nPiece of Paper Charred Around the Edges\n\nWith\nthe Words \"Greetings to the People of Earth - We Come in Peace - We Bring\nYou This Gift - The Following Chemical Formula is a Vaccine Against All Forms\nof Cancer\". From the episode THE GIFT. An alien ship\ncrashes outside of a Mexican village. After being shot by a policeman, a\nfriendly doctor pulls a couple of bullets from the alien. While recovering, the\nalien hands little Pedro a gift which he instructs Pedro to keep until later.\nThe army eventually barges in and when the alien tells Pedro to show the gift\nto them, they take it from him and set it on fire - and shoot the alien. The\ndoctor fetches the remainder of the \"gift\" from the ashes. When he\nreads it, only the words written above remain.\n\nThe Camera\n\nFrom\nthe episode A MOST\nUNUSUAL CAMERA. A couple of thieves find out that one of the pieces of\n\"junk\" they've stolen on their most recent heist is a camera which\ntakes instant pictures. The neat thing is that the photos reveal the same scene\nexactly as it will appear five minutes into the future. They decide to take the\ncamera to the racetrack where the thieves take a picture of the toteboard\nbefore a race. Sure enough, it reveals the results of the race before it\nbegins. The thieves bet on the last few races this way and wind up with a lot of\ncash. When they get back to their hotel room, a waiter delivering room service\npoints out that the inscription on the side of the camera says \"only ten\nto an owner\". The waiter leaves and the crooks argue over how to use the\nremaining pictures (I think there's only two left at this point). During the\nargument, the shutter button is accidentally pressed, wasting another shot (it\ndoes reveal that the argument is going to get more heated). Sure enough, the\ntwo male crooks get into a punching match and eventually tumble off the balcony\nto their deaths. This leaves the female crook alone with the loot. She uses the\nlast picture to take a shot of her former partners' bodies. As she begins\ncollecting all of the money for herself, the waiter bursts in and announces that\nhe knows that the guests in this room are crooks. He tries to take the money\nfor himself. When we see the last photo developed, it shows MORE than two\nbodies on the ground. The female thief rushes to the window, tripping on an\nextension cord and falling out. The waiter glances again at the photo: it shows\nFOUR bodies. As the episode closes, the screen is filled with a close-up of the\ncamera - and we hear the waiter scream and fall out the window too. This\nobviously explains why the camera in the game tells us what award is coming\nnext and why they cycle, rather than appearing randomly. I hope that most\nplayers can score better turnaround on these awards than once every five\nminutes, however.\n\nFemale Robot Head, sans a Face\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE LONELY.\nJack Warden, in one of the earliest aired episodes of the series, is a criminal\nfrom the future who has been sentenced to solitary confinement for fifty years\non a penal asteroid (he has the whole barren asteroid to himself). The captain\nof a passing freighter, who sympathizes with the criminal's plight, leaves him\na box containing a female robot named Alicia. Warden doesn't take to her at\nfirst, but soon he grows very fond of her, and eventually falls in love with\nher. After a few months go by, the captain of the freighter returns bearing\ngood news: Warden's been pardoned and is free to leave. However, weight\nrestrictions do not permit him to bring Alicia with him. Warden doesn't want to\nleave her, because he feels that she really is a woman. The captain takes out a\ngun and blows Alicia's face off, pointing out to Warden that all he's leaving\nbehind is loneliness.\n\nAnother Invader and their Flying Saucer\n\nAgain\nfrom THE INVADERS.\nNote that the flying saucer is conveniently turned so as not to reveal the\nwords \"U.S. Air Force\" (they're written on the top side of the saucer\nwhich must be hidden behind the domed part of it).\n\nON THE CABINET AND AROUND THE DOT MATRIX DISPLAY\n\nThe\nPyramid with Eye, E=MC^2, the Featureless Mannequin/Artists Model, the words\n\"TWILIGHT ZONE\", the Door, the Eye, and the Gumball Machine\n\nAll of\nthese (except for the first and the last) are from opening credits from one\nseason or another. The pyramid and the gumball machine were explained\npreviously.\n\nON THE PLAYFIELD\n\nSeveral\ndescriptions of the playfield have appeared in previous postings and in the\nrules.\nAs such, I'm going to presume that you have a basic feel for\nthe playfield's layout so that if I say something like \"on the plastic\nbeneath the clock\" you'll know that this is in the upper-right quadrant of\nthe playfield, and that if I try to sneak something like \"just to the left\nof the powerfield\" by you, you'll know that I'm really outside the\ncabinet. I will also not repeat the names of episodes in conjunction with\nplayfield features which have already been discussed. There are a few new ones\nwhich crop up, though.\n\nThe Gumball Machine\n\nAgain,\nit's a Lawlor original. There is another quarter standing on its edge on one of\nthe plastics toward the lower part.\n\nThe Powerfield\n\nHas the\npyramid with the eye as added by artist John Youssi.\n\nTown Square\n\nIn the\njet bumper area. The center piece says \"1959 HILLSIDE 1959\". Also\nnote that Santa Claus is running through the square. 1959 was the year in which\nThe Twilight Zone debuted. The aliens are observing the madness in town square\nfrom a nearby hillside, but I'm not certain if this is the specific reference.\nAnyone know the significance of HILLSIDE here for sure or have another theory?\n\nSpirals\n\nThose\nconcentric circles appear again around the magnets in the spiral loop and\naround the \"shoot again\" light (and even the credit button which I\nforgot to mention on the cabinet). More \"mad\" people appear in the\nspiral loop as well. Just inside the right spiral entrance, we see Willy the\nventriloquist's dummy holding the gumball machine (and Willy has a\ncharacteristic evil grin). At the right spiral entrance is Mr. Henry Bemis,\nwearing his broken glasses.\n\nRobby the Robot\n\nStanding\nat the entrance to the left (robot) ramp.\n\nRod Serling\n\nStanding\nat the entrance to the right (Powerfield) ramp.\n\nThe Clock\n\nA real\n\"working\" analog clock from the opening credits, complete with Zodiac\nsymbols. The playfield plastic beneath the clock has items from two episodes.\nFirst, there are a couple of \"buttons\" with the letters\n\"CSA\" and \"USA\" on them, along with a patch showing some\nsort of military rank in stripes. These are from the episode THE PASSERBY\n(\"CSA\" is \"Confederate States of America\"). The other item\nis from an episode not detailed on the backglass: it's a hand showing part of a\nwrist which is clearly mechanical inside (wires exposed\nunder the \"skin\"). This is from\nthe episode IN HIS IMAGE.\nI only have vague recollections of this episode, but suffice to say that\nsomeone who thought he was a man is actually a malfunctioning robot who is\nfinally deactivated by his creator (who made the robot in his image). The\nmalfunctioning robot is given to violent/murderous fits (he kills one woman\nearly in the episode and we become worried that he might attack another one\nlater on).\n\nThe Player Piano\n\nLocated\nbeneath the clock.\n\nThe Camera\n\nNear the upper left mini-flipper.\n\nThe Hitchhiker\n\nFrom\nthe episode THE\nHITCH-HIKER. A young woman driving across the country on vacation is\nterrified to see the same hitchhiker almost everywhere as she goes down the\nroad. She picks up a sailor as a traveling companion when she becomes scared.\nShe sees the hitchhiker again and tries to run him over. The sailor, who didn't\nsee any hitchhiker, thinks she's crazy and abandons her. When she calls home,\nshe finds out her mother has suffered a nervous breakdown because her daughter\nwas killed in a car accident a few days earlier. It was her - she had a blowout\nand apparently didn't survive after all. When she returns to her car, the\nhitchhiker - who she now knows is \"Mr. Death\" - is waiting for her in\nthe back seat.\n\nThe Slot Machine\n\nLocated\nat the lower right tunnel. The playfield plastic above the entrance to the slot\nmachine has another pair of broken spectacles and a copy of the book David\nCopperfield, which Mr. Bemis was reading prior to the end of civilization. This\nplastic also shows a broken stopwatch from the episode A KIND OF STOPWATCH. A\ntalkative man who has just lost his job goes into a bar to have a drink and\nforget. There he commiserates with a fellow who thanks him by handing him a\nvery special stopwatch: when the button is pressed, it freezes everyone except\nthe watch's owner. Pressing the button again unfreezes time and no one else is\nany the wiser. Of course when he tries to demonstrate it to his friends, he\ncannot because they are instantly frozen too. His frustration soon passes when\nhe decides he'll just freeze everybody while he makes a sizable withdrawal from\na local bank vault. On the way out of the vault, he drops the stopwatch; and\nwith the watch thus shattered, he's trapped in a world of frozen people with\nnobody to talk to. The plot points are very similar to TIME ENOUGH AT LAST, so\nit's doubly interesting that the artists chose to put items from both of these\nepisodes in such close proximity.\n\nThe Rocket\n\nOn the\nplayfield in front of the kicker.\n\nThe Door\n\nIn the\ncenter of the playfield, with panels indicating the appropriate door prizes.\n\nThe Slingshot Plastics\n\nThe\nleft plastic shows the featureless mannequin/artists model,the right plastic\nshows yet another invader.\n\nFlipper Return Lane Plastics\n\nThe plastics\non both left and right side leading to the lower flippers show the rooftops of\na residential area, each with an antenna or a satellite dish, presumably tuned\ninto the Twilight Zone.\n\nWhew!!!\nThat's the best I could do. As I said, I welcome any corrections or additions\nto what I've gone over above. I'm certain I've missed a few things given all of\nthe work and detail which the folks at Bally have obviously put into this game\n(I know I've omitted several of the\nappropriate dot-matrix animations). Note however that I purposely did not\ninclude things which appear on the game that are clearly NOT tie-ins to\nepisodes or the Twilight Zone experience.\nIt's\nthis kind of depth in a licensed game that makes it even more attractive IMHO,\nno matter which manufacturer it's from. I hope this list gives some of the\nnon-Zoners among you an even deeper appreciation of the game, its license, and\nthe integration of the two.\n\nBrian A.

The\npinball machine is very much a typical Sega Pinball with that\nSega \"feel\".  The rules differ in that it doesn't have a progressive\nmode based rule set but instead has different modes that can be\nstarted independently at different times.  These modes are well\nbalanced scoring-wise so that the strategy can change at different\ntimes in the game\n\nThere are many similarities with the older Williams game, Whirlwind\nwith the spinning disk on the playfield and fan on top of the\nbackbox.  Overall, in my opinion I give the machine a B+.\n\nBackground\nRent the movie...\n\nPlayfield\nHere's the various playfield parts, starting from the plunger lane\nand working clockwise.\n\n\n Plunger\nDual plunger, automatic and manual.  Note as with all Sega\ngames, flipping both flippers will release the ball automatically.\n Right Outlane\nCan be lit for Blown Away.  Simply some extra points to make\nyou feel better about losing your ball.  Slings alternate lit\noutlane.\n Right Inlane\nScores South compass direction when not lit.  Flippers alternate\nlit inlane with the other (except in Weathervane mode).  Also\nlights left orbit for Wind.\n Flippers\nThe usual two, in the usual places. Center post too.\nTypical Sega type flippers.\n Slingshots\nStandard, just like the flippers.  Seem to be stronger than\nusual Sega games.  This can be bad in that it often launches\nthe ball off the playfield (and sometimes to the outlane!).\n Left Inlane\nScores West(?) compass direction when not lit.  Flippers alternate\nlit inlane with the other (except in Weathervane mode).  Also\nlights right orbit for Wind.\n Left Outlane\nCan be lit for Blown Away (see right outlane).\n Southwest and Northwest Targets\nScores respective compass directions when not lit.\n Left Orbit\nCan be lit for Wind (See Cow Multibull below).  Can also be lit for\nDebris (See Twister Targets below).  Lights itself for Wind if not\nlit.\n Twister Targets\nCompleting Twister targets (that spell Twister) IN ORDER awards\nnext Twister mode (see below).\n Cannister Target/Hole\nDrop target hides a hole (see Cannister Multiball below).\n Rollovers\nThree rollovers.  Complete rollovers to advance Bonus X.  Bonus X\nmaxes out at 8x?  Completing after that scores Extra Ball Lit once\nper game.  After that, 20M?\n Pop Bumpers\nScore 250K a hit except when lit for Super Pops, score 1M a pop.\nCompleting a certain number scores a certain value.  This may\nprogress somehow.   It may also light Super Pops.\n Orbit Magnet\nA magnet at the top of the orbit grabs balls when an orbit shot\nat a lit Wind occurs.  This captures the ball and scores the\nWind value.  Also active for all balls shot here when Super\nPops are active.\n Ramp\nOnly one ramp, advances towards Chase Multiball (see below),\nscores Extra Ball, used during Chase Hurry-Up, and Twister\nMultiball for jackpots.  Ball is fed to playfield just above\nleft flipper.  Also lights Wind on right orbit.\n Ramp Targets\nTargets on each side of ramp score North and Northeast\ncompass directions respectively when not lit.\n Right Orbit\nCan be lit for Wind (See Cow Multibull below).  Can also be lit for\nDebris (See Twister Targets below).  Lights itself for Wind if not\nlit.\n East and Southeast Targets\nScores respective compass directions when not lit.\n Spinning Disk\nThe main toy.  A spinning disk with a magnet on it.  The magnet\nis active during skill shot and at start of Cannister Multiball.\nAlso on during Cannister Multiball where it captures a ball and\nlets it go.  The disk spins most of the time throughout the\ngame, diverting your ball slightly.\n\n\nGeneral Rules\nHolding right flipper and pressing start puts the game in\nWizard mode.  We have no idea how the rules differ here yet.\nHolding left flipper and pressing start, starts \"League Play\".\nSee below for differences in rules.\n\nBuy In is NOT enabled in default settings.  No Buy-In high score list.\n\nSoftware Changes: None known at this time...\n\nIn general, there are many things to do in this game.  See the different\nmodes below and try them out!  There doesn't appear to be any long\nterm goal besides scoring points and not draining.\n\nSkill Shot\nShoot ball with plunger towards magnet on spinning disk.  If ball is\ncaptured before a switch is hit, score skill shot.\nSkill shot awards are generally scored in the following order:\n\n\n 30M\n Free Game or Extra Ball Lit or Weathervane\n Super Pops\n Super Lock\n Max Bonus Multiplier?\n Hold Bonus?\n\n\nThe free game and extra ball lit vary based on current score, machine\nsettings, and past game award history.  This order can vary from player\nto player unless the game is set to League play in which case each player\nwill receive the same skill shot awards in order.\n\nAwarded Modes\nThere are a set of modes which can be \"awarded\" to a player.  This can\nhappen via completing the compass targets or through the skill shot.\nModes are not repeated until they are all completed.\n\n   Weathervane\nAll other game activity stops for this mode EXCEPT scoring locks for\nCannister Multiball and starting and playing said mode.  After Multiball\nends, Weathervane resumes.\n\nAll compass targets are flashing.  You get 10M for starting and 5M+10M for\neach target scored.  Once all targets are complete or 30?\nseconds pass, mode ends.  No extra award for completing targets.\n\nNote inlane compass directions do NOT rotate with flippers!  Get that\nHuxley shot down!  You actually need that here!\n\n   Super Pops\nPops score 1M a hit for rest of ball (or after X hits?).  Stacking\nSuper Pops awards does nothing.  When Super Pops is lit, upper orbit\nmagnet always grabs the ball.\n\n   Extra Ball Lit\nShoot ramp for extra ball.  These DO stack.\n\n   Super Lock\nA three ball multiball.  Hurry-up value starts at 42M and counts\ndown to 10M.  Shoot left orbit to lock value.  Shoot lock hole to award\nvalue until back down to one ball.\n\nTwister Targets\nComplete Twister targets IN ORDER to score following background modes\nin order.  These modes are not active during a multiball mode or\nWeathervane.\n\n   Debris\nShoot left orbit to score 10M, 20M, 30M, 40M, 50M, and 60M respectively at\nwhich point mode ends.\n\n   Chase Hurry Up\n10M for starting plus a count up from 20M to 50M.  Each shot to ramp\nscores value.  Ramp and pops temporarily stop count up.\n\n   Damage\nIdentical to Debris except at right orbit.\n\n   Double Scoring\nEverything scores double for rest of ball!\n\nCannister Multiball\n[Factoid: This was originally called Dorothy II multiball in the\nprototypes yet was renamed due to potential licensing risks with\nMGM's Wizard of Oz.]\n\nShoot lock drop target to reveal hole.  Shoot hole to lock ball.\nFirst multiball requires 3 locks (5 on extra hard settings), next 4,\nand subsequent multiballs require 5 balls.  When drop target drops for\nthe start multiball shot, it only remains down for a certain period of\ntime.  The time is shorter for subsequent multiballs.\n\nThe number of balls is generally the number of locks EXCEPT when\nplaying multi-player in which case you get a ball for each lock\nat minimum PLUS any previous players balls that have been locked in\nthe Cannister.\n\nThe balls are ejected from the cannister or auto plunged to make up\nany balls short in the cannister.  They are deposited onto the spinning\ndisk and magnet.  Once they are collected, the magnet releases and the\nballs go flying!  You get 25M for starting.\n\nShoot the ramp for jackpot which starts at 10M * balls in play and builds\nby 5M per cannister lock shot, and 202,220 per switch.  Once it is scored,\nyou have 8-16 seconds to shoot ramp again (depending on difficulty\nsettings) to score double jackpot, then again for triple jackpot.\nAfter any three jackpots are scored then you must shoot the lock for\nsuper jackpot for the sum of the three jackpots you just scored.  Repeat\nuntil only one ball remains.  Super Jackpot timer is 7, 9, 11, 13, or 15\nseconds depending on difficulty settings.\n\nNote: If ball is going to be auto plunged, manually plunge ball hard\nso it doesn't collect on magnet and gives you time to try and shoot\nit up the ramp while the other balls are kept out of your way.\n\nChase Multiball\nShoot ramp 5 times (plus number of previous Chase Multiballs played)\nto start Chase Multiball.  Shooting ramp twice in succession scores\nan extra ramp, thrice in succession, two extra, etc.\n\nChase multiball is a 5 ball multiball.  Your objective is to advance\nthrough the different tornado levels F1 through F5.  You must score (40\n+ F Level scored * 20) switches to light ramp for jackpot and add-a-ball.\njackpot scores 1M * switches scored to light it.  Each switch scores 1M\nwhile jackpot is lit.  Once F5 is scored, mode restarts at beginning but\nwith 140 switches to light jackpot.\n\nCow Multibull (\"We've got Cows!!\")\nShoot orbits when lit for Wind to advance towards Cow Multibull.  Each\nWind shot scores ?.  Initially 9 shots are required to start Cow Multibull.\nSubsequent starts each require 1? more?   If the lit orbit is scored twice\nin succession, an extra advance is scored.  This only happens if the orbit\nmagnet misses (or is broken), or the ball rolls up and down the lane\nwithout getting captured.\n\nCow Multibull is a 5 ball multibull.  Each orbit is lit for a 20M jackpot\nwhich advances 250K for each switch.  It completes when one ball is left.\nNext cow multibull jackpot value resets to 20M.\n\"Mooo!\"\nCombos\nSuccessive ramps and orbits gain an extra ramp or orbit.\n\nBonus\n1M/Ramp + 1M/Twister Target (lit or unlit) + 3M/Orbit + 3M/Lock.\nCap on each of 99M.  Only shots made that ball count.\n\nThis bonus is then multiplied by the current bonus multiplier\nwhich is not held.  It can be up to 8X.  Once bonus multiplier\nis maxed, next scored may light Extra Ball, otherwise 20M is awarded.\n\nExtra Balls\nThere are many ways to collect extra balls in this game:\n\n Possible from Skill Shot\n Possible from Completing Compass Targets\n Maxing Bonus X\n\n\nLeague Play Mode\nHold left flipper while pressing start button.  Only known difference\nobserved for sure is that skill shot and compass awards are consistent\nfrom player to player.\n\nStrategy\nThe big modes are Cow Multibull, Chase Multiball, and Cannister Multiball\ngenerally in that order.  So get your orbit shots down!!  Shoot orbits\nwhen lit.  Shoot ramp or lock hole when respective orbit is not lit.\nStart those modes and score as much as you can!  That's about it.  Go\nfor the other modes when they present themselves.  AVOID Weathervane!\nSince everything else stops, the risk of the mode is not worth it in\ngeneral.  If your skill shot is lit for Weathervane, intentionally miss\nit.  If you get it by accident you might as well play it, it is points,\nbut it is more danger than it is worth, I feel.\n\nA good score is over 1B.  A wizard score is 3B+...\n\nAny questions or additions, please email me!!

{"page_content": "TX-Sector Strategy Guide\n\nWhen TX-Sector made an appearance at PAPA 13, it surprised many\npeople, with its unusually good music and sound effects.  Gottlieb\ngames of this era were known for being rather cheap and mediocre.\nHowever, Gottlieb did spend a relatively substantial portion of their\nbudget on their sound quality.  Compared to other manufacturers,\nGottlieb sound was rather crisp and clean.  This might not have been\nthe best business decision, though, because most players in noisy\narcades would never get to appreciate this.  Gottlieb games thus\nretained their mediocre reputation.  Sales must have been poor,\nbecause their games of this era are quite uncommon.  They remain\nunfamiliar to many players.  I grew up near the Scandia arcade in\nRohnert Park, CA, which had one of these unusual Gottlieb games on\nlocation: Robo-War.  Like TX-Sector, it has very good sound, so I\nlearned to appreciate these games.\n\nTX-Sector uses a clever gimmick: it invisibly \"teleports\" the ball\nfrom one area of the playfield to another.  It accomplishes this by\nusing staged balls.  If you're unfamiliar with that pinball term, a\nstaged ball is a special kind of ball lock (not part of the regular\nMultiball lock sequence) that holds the ball into a ready position, to\nbe quickly released when needed by the game, without requiring the\nplayer to wait for the ball to be mechanically moved.  A typical\nmodern game only uses staged balls to speed up regular gameplay, but\nTX-Sector takes the idea to its extreme, making it the central focus\nof the game.  A minimum of one ball is kept staged at all times.  TX-\nSector is a 3-ball game, but because of this, it only has a 2-ball\nMultiball.\n\nWhen the game is first powered on, it will release all 3 balls to the\ntrough, in order to count them (due to a Gottlieb design limitation,\nthere aren't enough trough switches, so the game must keep count in\nsoftware).  The first time the player enters any teleporter entrance,\neven if it is not lit, the game will lock the ball for staging.  This\ndoesn't count as a regular lock, and the player gets no award, but\ngets to hear the rare sound effect \"Teleport sequence initialized\".\nThis should only happen during the very first game played, after the\nmachine is turned on.  After that, unless the game malfunctions (by\nfumbling the staging of a ball), there should never be more than 2\nballs loose on the playfield.\n\nTypical to Gottlieb games of the era, there are almost no operator-\nadjustable difficulty settings.  Most of the 32 DIP switches are used\nfor coinage.  There is only one setting that makes a difference, and\nthat is the memorization of Energy Levels.  It can be set to clear\nafter the end of each ball, which makes the game substantially\nharder.  Unfortunately, it does not address a major flaw in the game's\nrules: subsequent Multiballs are *easier* to get than the first\nMultiball.  So, the game is very unforgiving to new players, but a\ngood player can keep a ball going almost forever.  By building Energy\nLevels back up during a good Multiball, the single-ball workload\nnecessary to reach the next Multiball is dramatically reduced.\n\nUnlike other Gottlieb games, I have not encountered any major\ndifferences between 3-ball and 5-ball play, other than the fact that\nsome scoring values are lowered for 5-ball play.  FIXME: Verify this.\nSome Gottlieb games of the era are known for making lights toggle\nduring 5-ball that are otherwise solidly lit during 3-ball, such as\nthe carrier landing \"jackpot\" shot in Gold Wings.\n\nThe plunger lane design is brilliant.  The ball enters a ramp, and is\nlifted directly over to the top left flipper.  Plunge gently, to\ndeliver a slow feed that is easy to control.  Do not plunge hard,\nbecause the ball can easily take a bad hop off the metal of the ramp\nexit.  The player is given unlimited chances to make a soft plunge\n(some groups of players may wish to apply the Whitewater house rule\nhere, to make sure games do not take too long).\n\nThe right drain is unusual.  There are three \"Play More\" posts down\nthere, forming a triangle, that provide the opportunity to get the\nball back into the plunger lane, for another shot.  The player\nreceives no points for this, but the opportunity to keep playing the\nball is already an ample reward.  The best way to extricate the ball\nfrom this area is to shake the game from left to right.  Watch out for\nsudden tilt.  Gottlieb games of this era have zero tilt warnings, and\nwill suddenly tilt out.  What's worse, in a multiplayer game they are\nvery prone to also tilting out the next player's ball!  This can get\nyou disqualified from a tournament, so be very careful.  Definitely\nsacrifice a ball or two during practice play, in order to feel out the\nmachine and know its limits.\n\nThe left drain is ordinary.  Nothing to do there except listen to the\ncheesy 1980's computer voice say \"Power drain\".\n\nThere are left and right kicking targets, just above each outlane\nentrance.  They add additional speed and randomness to the game.\nWatch out, because similar to how the slingshots raise the ball\nslightly and aim it at the outlane, these kicking targets will lower\nthe ball slightly and aim it at the outlane.\n\nThere are basically two things to do in TX-Sector: build your Energy\nLevel, and teleport for points.  Your Energy Level begins at zero, and\ngoes up to 10.  At Energy Level 10, Lock is lit.  This begins a two-\nball Multiball, and lights Extra Ball (and possibly Special).  At the\nstart of this Multiball, your Energy Level is reset to zero again, but\nyou can build it up during your Multiball.  As mentioned above, this\nmakes subsequent Multiballs much easier to achieve than the first\nMultiball.\n\nThere are 3 shots on the game which can be lit for teleport: side\nramp, left ramp, and a tunnel passage behind the side ramp.\n\nThe left ramp is the easiest shot to make, but it is obstructed by a\ndrop target that must be knocked down first.  The tunnel passage is\nburied back in the rear, on the right side of the game, behind the\nside ramp.\n\nDespite its location, the tunnel passage is fairly easy to enter, as\nit can be reached from either a flipper shot or a lucky bounce from\nthe jet bumpers.  The side ramp, however, requires a clean flipper\nshot, and if you miss this ramp, it will most likely provide a\ndangerous feed into the left kicking target.\n\nThe left ramp is easy to shoot, but its entrance is blocked by a drop\ntarget, which is unusually wide.  It is easy to knock down, but the\nrebound from the target can be dangerous.  This exposes the left ramp\nfor a limited period of time.  If there is a teleport available on the\nleft ramp, a hurryup multiplier will be shown on the display.  Nailing\nthis can be worth big points.  The game will give plenty of \"Warning,\nwarning, warning\" just before the time expires.  The game will then\nraise the drop target, announcing \"Interlink disabled\".  There is no\ngrace period, so the player will then receive no award, even if a ball\nwas already on the ramp.\n\nHitting the left ramp, when not lit for teleport, only awards a lousy\n10K, and multipliers don't apply.  Since the left ramp feeds the right\ndead-end lane, which is more dangerous than the left dead-end lane,\nthis is not a wise use of a shot.\n\nThe teleport shots tie into where the staged ball is currently staged\nat.  Although it seems random at first, they are completely\ndeterministic.  After accomplishing a teleport, a good player should\nalways know what teleport shots will next be lit.\n\nIf the ball is staged on the right side, the side ramp will be lit for\nteleport.  The left ramp will *not* light for teleport in this case.\nHowever, since the resulting Teleport Multiplier is good for any\nteleport, not just the left ramp, it can still be worth it to knock\ndown the left ramp's drop target.\n\nIf the ball is staged on the left side, however, the tunnel passage\nwill be lit for teleport.  The left ramp *will* be lit for teleport in\nthis case, so go ahead and knock down that drop target.  Whenever\nyou're thinking about hitting the drop target to light the left ramp\nfor teleport, first take a look at where the other teleport is: if\nit's the tunnel passage, you're good to go, but if it's the side ramp,\nit won't work.\n\nDon't bother teleporting early in the game.  Since the point award is\nonly 10K plus an additional 10K per lit Energy Level, your efforts are\nbest spent building up Energy Levels.  To score from teleporting,\nEnergy Levels must be currently lit.  Previously saved sets of 10\nEnergy Levels only count towards end-of-ball bonus, and don't count\ntowards teleport points.\n\nSo, at the start of Multiball, after your lit Energy Levels are saved\nand then cleared, try to build up some more Energy Levels.  Depending\non the speed of your game, though, you may want to play it safe and\ndefensively park the balls into the bumpers or a teleport, so that\nthey don't insta-drain at the start of your Multiball (something that\nis distressingly common on TX-Sector).\n\nThere are 5 shots that increase Energy Level: left dead-end when lit,\nright dead-end when lit, left and right drop target banks (always\navailable), and the rear target behind the bumpers (always available).\n\nThe left and right dead-end shots alternate being lit.  The game\nalternates the lights whenever they are hit, and also whenever a\npowered rebound activates (jet bumper, slingshot, or kicking target).\nThis also applies to the Extra Ball and Special lights that are on the\ndead-end shots.  If the operator has disabled Extra Ball and/or\nSpecial, the compensatory point value for each is a flat 500K, a\npretty good award, making them worth shooting for.  The left dead-end\nshot is a safer shot to aim for, as it cleanly feeds the upper left\nflipper, much like the \"H\" shot in Doctor Who.\n\nBecause of the rear target that advances Energy Level, the bumper\ngarden on this game can be huge.  If you're good at keeping the ball\nin the bumpers, you can score multiple hits on this target, because\nthe ball will often deflect into it.  Since every hit advances your\nEnergy Level, and it's always available, this can be the fastest way\nin the game to build your Energy Level.  Plus, TX-Sector has some of\nthe all-time best bumper sound effects of any game, especially when\ncombined with the spinner sound effects.\n\nThere are 2 center loop shots that enter the bumpers.  The right shot\nhas the greatest chance of hitting that rear target, as it is aimed\nmore accurately at it, but the left shot also has a good chance of\nrebounding off the jets into it.\n\nThere are 2 spinners, one at the entrance to each center loop shot.\nEach is lit by opposite inlane, for 10K per spin.  Early in the game,\nthese spinner points can be big, but later on, your time is best spent\ntrying to farm teleports and keep your Energy Levels high.  Also, keep\nin mind that Gottlieb spinners often don't spin as well as the\nWilliams spinners you might be more accustomed to, so even though 10K\nper spin sounds huge, it isn't.  FIXME: Check this.  Is this really\nopposite inlane, or same?\n\nThe 1X, 2X, 3X lights, near both 4-banks of drop targets, might look\nlike bonus multipliers, but they are not.  Instead, they tell you how\nmany Energy Level advances you will earn, by completing the respective\nbank.  Once lit at 3X, getting three Energy Levels by knocking down a\nbank of 4 drop targets provides good shot efficiency, especially if\nyou are able to aim a shot so that the rebound from a drop target bank\nhits the targets in the other drop target bank.  FIXME: Do these\nlights hold over from ball to ball?\n\nBoth lights will always indicate the same value.  Knocking down all 8\ndrop targets will increase that value.  The lights tell you which\ntarget bank(s) you need in order to complete all 8: if the light by a\n4-bank is flashing, it's telling you that knocking down that bank will\nmake progress towards completing all 8.  If the light by a 4-bank is\nsteady, though, it means that you have already knocked down that\nbank.  Completing a bank that is lit steady is still worthwhile,\nthough, as it will award the lit value, even though it won't advance\nthe value.\n\nEven though they provide ample opportunity to advance Energy Levels,\nthe drop targets are generally to be avoided.  The rebound from them\ncan be risky.  It's rarely necessary to deliberately shoot the drop\ntargets, because they will be hit often enough by random rebounds from\nother missed shots.  If only a single drop target is remaining in a\nbank, though, especially if the light is flashing for that bank, take\na chance and shoot it.\n\nOnce the lights reach 3X, completing all 8 drop targets apparently\nwon't do anything more, but after doing this at least once, the next\nMultiball you start will also include a lit Special (in addition to\nthe usual lit Extra Ball).  Unless your machine is on coin play,\ntrying to build up to this Special generally isn't worth it.  FIXME:\nWhat causes the lights to reset from 3X to 1X?  Draining a ball often\ntimes holds the value over.  It might be like Blackout, and only reset\nonce the player drains with the maximum value lit.\n\nThe game keeps continuous count of how many Energy Levels you have\nobtained, including earlier sets of 10.  It seems to increase without\nlimit, and holds over from ball to ball, so end-of-ball bonus can be\nrather substantial.  (Point to ponder: as with many video games of the\nera, it's an 8-bit computer, and the register might max out internally\nat 255.  Is it possible to eventually roll over the bonus?  I saw\nsomebody do this on Robo-War, when the game was broken, having a jumpy\nswitch, causing bonus to freely increase randomly throughout the\ngame.)\n\nThe point award for doing a teleport is a base value of 10K, plus an\nadditional 10K for each lit Energy Level.  So, if Lock is currently\nlit (Energy Level 10), the point award is 110K.  This is multiplied by\nthe current value of the \"Teleport Multiplier\" hurryup countdown, as\nindicated on the display.  When the drop target blocking the left ramp\nis first knocked down, the Teleport Multiplier is initialized to 9X.\nThe maximum possible award for doing a teleport is thus 990K.  The\nTeleport Multiplier quickly counts down, though, resetting the drop\ntarget once it lowers all the way back down to 1X.\n\nThis takes only about 15 seconds, so once you knock down the target,\nimmediately shoot for a lit teleport (it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe the exposed left ramp shot).  The multiplier only lasts for a\nsingle teleport, and the drop target will be reset immediately\nafterwards.  The drop target never needs to be qualified, so it's\nimmediately available to be knocked down again.  Experiment with the\nrebound from hitting the drop target, to see if you can get it under\ncontrol to a flipper that can quickly shoot into a teleport.  The\nability to reliably collect teleports at 9X will do wonders for your\nscore!\n\nEnd of ball bonus is simply 10K per Energy Level.  No multiplier.  If\nyou drain early in your game, before you can collect a single Energy\nLevel, you will be awarded a whopping bonus count of zero!  Keep this\nin mind, and nudge aggressively early on, because you have nothing to\nlose if you tilt out.\n\nAchieving the Lock (Energy Level 10) is the highest point value\nteleport that is possible.  After this is done, all lit energy levels\nwill be collected as if they were bonus, giving you 100K and the\npretty light show.  They will then be cleared, so by the time you\nshoot the second ball to begin Multiball, your energy level will start\nover at 0.  The 10 previous Energy Levels you had will still count\ntowards your end of ball bonus (scoring 100K with a loud \"static\"\nsound effect), but they will no longer count towards any teleportation\nyou do.  So, when you are at a high Energy Level, try to farm some\nteleports with a high Teleport Multiplier, before completing the\nadvance to Lock.  If Lock is collected under Teleport Multiplier 9X,\nthat's a total award of 990K!  I believe this is the highest-scoring\nshot in the game.\n\nIf you have the ball caught on a flipper, shooting for the left dead-\nend lane can be safer than the right dead-end lane.  The left lane\nguarantees a return feed to the upper flipper, but the right lane has\nno such guarantee.  On some machines, the right lane rebound can be\nquite dangerous, as it can graze the top of the right slingshot and\nbounce out of control (as with the TAF Swamp kickout).  Doing\nteleports from the left ramp and tunnel passage will also\n\"reintegrate\" the ball to the right dead-end lane, so be careful with\nthe feed out of there.  Teleporting via the side ramp is safer, as it\nwill reintegrate the ball into the left dead-end lane, feeding the\nupper flipper again (sometimes the ramp can be looped, on a machine\nthat is extra generous, but this is unreliable).\n\nWhen you begin Multiball, the first thing you should do is check the\ndead-end lanes, for lit Extra Balls or Specials.  If any were to\nlight, they would do so at this time.  In tournament settings, they\nare worth 500K each, so they are still worth shooting for.  The game\ndoes not announce them or anything like that, it just quietly turns on\ntheir lights, so pay attention.  The lights will alternate with the\nbumpers.\n\nSince Extra Ball and Special light so rarely, if their bulbs burn out,\nit will be hard to tell if they're lit.  Before playing, watch the\nattract mode carefully, to see if the bulbs are working.  If you're\nunsure, just shoot the lane blindly.  This is a reasonable strategy in\nMultiball, since the other ball is probably bouncing around randomly,\nso it could help you by bouncing into a bumper and alternating the\nlights so that the lane becomes lit by the time the first ball hits\nit.  Plus, taking the shot frees up the flippers, which will most\nlikely be needed soon for saving that other ball that's randomly\nbouncing around.\n\nThe \"Shoot Again\" lights are doubled-up on this game, for whatever\nreason.  As is typical of Gottlieb games, they are hot pink, and flash\nin a rather distracting way when earned.  If you already have Shoot\nAgain lit, Extra Ball will not light.  So, you can't stack more than\none Extra Ball at a time.  FIXME: Is this correct?  The player might\nhave the additional limitation of only having one Extra Ball per ball\nin play, not just one Extra Ball at a time.  This might be an operator\nsetting.\n\nIn Multiball, watch out, if you relight the entire sequence of 10\nEnergy Levels, they will simply be reset to zero!  There is no award\nfor doing this.  The 10 Energy Levels you had, though, will still be\nremembered by the game for your end-of-ball bonus count.  To avoid\nlosing your lit Energy Levels, it might be worth sacrificing a ball\nduring Multiball, especially to avoid the risk of \"double drain\"\nduring Multiball.  FIXME: Verify they are still remembered for end-of-\nball bonus.\n\nHaving a single ball in play, under control, can often be more\nvaluable than having two balls that are out of control.  It's possible\nto get the best of both worlds in TX-Sector, though: in Multiball, if\nyou are lucky enough to get a save via the right outlane, you can\nleave the ball parked on the plunger lane while you play the remaining\nball.  As in Firepower, this is among the best possible situations a\nplayer can get into, during the course of the game.  Unlike modern\nGottlieb games, TX-Sector does not penalize the player in any way for\nleaving the ball on the plunger switch, so it's like having a free\nExtra Ball.  FIXME: Better also verify this.\n\nThe most difficult thing in TX-Sector to do, is to get the music out\nof your head once you are done playing :)\n\n\nAdditional Notes, 8/29/10\n\nThe left and right dead-end targets can be alternately lit for an\nEnergy Level advance.  Hitting the slingshots or kicking targets (but\n*not* the jet bumpers) will toggle which target is lit.  Hitting a lit\ntarget will *not* cause the light to toggle away from it.  So, it's\npossible to repeatedly hammer on a target, scoring many advances.\n\nI recommend feeling out both dead-end target shots, and the rebound\nfeeds from each, at the start of your game.  If you can find a rebound\nfeed that's controllable, and repeatable, you're golden.  It might be\neasiest to start with the left dead-end target, since the rebound from\nthat will always feed the upper left flipper.  That might lead you\ninto thinking that the side ramp is a repeatable shot, as on Doctor\nWho.  While it's certainly possible to loop the side ramp on TX-\nSector, it's not worth it, because it awards very few points when not\nlit, and it's risky.  If you go halfway up that ramp and miss, it's an\nalmost sure feed to the left outlane area.\n\nIt might be worth experimenting to see what the rebound feed from the\nleft dead-end target lane is, when you don't use the upper left\nflipper at all, and let it roll back to the lower area of your game.\nIf you don't get into too much trouble with the left slingshot, this\nmight be a better alternative than trying to use the upper left\nflipper.  Alternatively, evaluate the difficulty of shooting for the\ntunnel passage if it's lit, and also, try shooting for the left ramp\ndrop target from the upper left flipper (the angle on this shot can be\ntough, but it's worth it, as the rebound will usually be easier to\ncontrol than if you had taken the shot from a lower flipper).\n\nWhen in Multiball, immediately shoot for any lit Extra Ball and/or\nSpecial.  As soon as your Multiball ends, these will be turned off, no\ngrace period.  Collect the awards as quickly as possible, to avoid\nlosing them in the event of a bad Multiball.\n\nOther than that, there's no real objective to Multiball.  There's no\njackpot, or anything else that's not in the single-ball game.  A good\nstrategy, once you get control of both balls during Multiball, is to\nuse one ball to knock down the left ramp drop target, then at the same\ntime send the other ball towards a lit teleport.  Once the drop target\nis knocked down, hopefully the other ball will be in position for you\nto immediately make the teleport shot.  That will give you the best\nchance of collecting a teleport when the Teleport Multiplier is at 9X,\nwhich is only possible during the first few seconds after the drop\ntarget is knocked down (this time constraint makes it almost\nimpossible to achieve during single-ball play).\n\nOn easier operator settings, it's possible to light the Special as\nsoon as the 3X advance is lit at both drop target banks.  It might not\nbe necessary to knock down both drop target banks again after lighting\n3X.\n\nThe game still resets the advance value of both drop target banks to\n1X.  This makes it rather unrewarding to shoot for the drop target\nbanks, as all progress will be lost at end of ball.\n\nIf you overdo your Energy Levels during Multiball, you will get the\nfamiliar sound and light show as they are collected, earning a total\nof 100K points.  This is rather disappointing, because this consumes\nall of your Energy Levels, at a time when you would much rather have\nthem still lit.  FIXME: Is there any other award that the game gives,\nfor doing this during Multiball?\n\nThere are 2 spinners, and 2 inlanes.  Each inlane will light the\nspinner on the opposite side of the game, for 10K per spin, when lit.\nIf the spinners haven't been lit yet, there will always be one inlane\nlit at a time.  The lit inlane is toggled back and forth whenever the\nslingshots or kicking targets (but *not* the jet bumpers) are hit.\nHitting the lit inlane, in addition to lighting the spinner, will\nimmediately move the light to the opposite inlane.  The spinner will\nstay lit for a while, but after being hit by the player when lit, it\nwill only stay lit for a short time more.  FIXME: I'm pretty sure this\nis how it works, but I'm not sure of the exact timing of the spinner\nlights, or what happens when you try to light both spinners at once.\n\nUnlike most other Gottlieb games, I was unable to find any gameplay\ndifference on TX-Sector between 3-ball and 5-ball play.\n\nIf you own a TX-Sector, good for you, as I'm pretty sure there was a\ndecent upward spike in the value of this game right after PAPA 13 :)\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "TX-Sector", "possible_shots": "side ramp, left ramp, tunnel passage, left dead-end, right dead-end, left and right drop target banks, rear target behind the bumpers, 2 center loop shots, 2 spinners", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/tx-sector.txt"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Vector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Vector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten by Ryan Avery (Ryan.Avery@Colorado.edu)\nLast Update: 6/9/98\n\n\nVector is copyright Bally 1982. If you have any questions, comments,\nupdates, or anything else, please feel free to e-mail me.\n\n\nPlayfield Layout\n\nAs usual, I'll start at the bottom and work my way around clockwise. The\nplayfield is somewhat unusual, which will make things hard to describe.\nThis game has dual playfields like Black Knight, where ramps are actually\njust\ninclined metal planes. Semi-unusual outlane configuration.\nInside left lane\nMakes a path for the ball to go through the outlane or the collect\nbonus saucer.\nCollect Bonus Saucer (left)\nA ball bouncing around in the outlane might end up here. Located on\nthe outside of the inside left lane. The game can usually be nudged\nto get the ball here, saving the ball. It shoots the ball to the right\nflipper on a correctly adjusted game.\nOutside left lane\n'C' shaped, feeds the ball to the flipper.\nDefender drop targets\n6 drop targets, in 2 rows of 3 each. These drop targets block access\nto the Vectorscan ramp.\nUpper Left Flipper\nSmall size, can be used to hit upper defender targets (off a rebound),\nHYPE targets, or to send the ball to the upper playfield.\nVectorscan ramp\nThe main objective of the game. It loops around the edge of the game,\nlike an inclined orbit. At the end of the ramp, the ball is caught in the\nfirst energy storage pod. This ramp is timed.\nEnergy Storage Pods\n3 saucers. The first saucer can either kick the ball back into the\nplay to the upper right flipper, or send the ball down to the second saucer.\nThis second saucer will, in turn, send the ball to the third capture saucer.\nThe third saucer releases balls for multiball.\nUpper Right Flipper\nStandard size, located on the upper playfield. Its only function is\nto hit the XYZ targets.\nXYZ drop targets\nHit by the upper right flipper. Due to their close proximity to the\nflipper, these targets tend to fail easily.\nRight ramp\nSends the ball from the lower playfield to the upper playfield, hitting\na target that increases value each time it is hit.\nMiddle ramp\nAlso sends the ball from the lower playfield to the upper playfield\n(but more commonly, visa-versa), but does not score any points.\nMiddle-Left ramp\nOnly shot from the plunger. 'C' shaped, and feeds to the upper playfield.\nHYPE targets\n4 targets which have many functions. Between the right and middle\nramps.\nRight outlane\nStandard shape. If ball bounces right (or nudged), a ball headed down\nthis lane can be nudged into the Right Bonus Saucer.\nRight inlane\nStandard, shoots the ball to the left flipper if properly aligned.\nRight Bonus Saucer\nSame as the left bonus saucer, but a bit of a different configuration.\nThis bonus saucer is located on the inside of the outlane. A ball can be\neasily nudged into this saucer when it is heading down the outlane.\nFlippers\nSame old flippers.\nPlunger\nStandard plunger. A ball coming out of the plunger lane will be fed\ninto the playfield (like LW3, JP, T2...), and up the middle-left ramp,\nwhich will feed the ball to the upper right flipper.\n\n\nRules\n\nWe'll start with basic rules and gameplay, then move on to Vector specific\nrules.\nNOTE: This game has three (3) types of bonuses. The Vectorscan bonus\nis what is displayed on the 6-digit display under the playfield. The bonus\nscore is what is displayed with the blue bonus inserts. The Vectorscan\nRAMP bonus is shown by the lights along the Vectorscan lane. These will\nbe discussed later.\nNOTE 2: The Vectorscan ramp timer is not complex at all. As soon as\nthe ball begins the ramp, a timer is started from 1000 and counts down\nto 0 very quickly. The faster the ball reaches the end of the ramp, the\nbetter the time, and the better the score (1000 times the first two digits\nof the speed).\nSkill-shot\nIn theory, the skill shot is to send the ball up the middle-left ramp\nat the proper trajectory, sending the ball back down the right ramp (the\nramp with the scoring target). In reality, most all balls will hit H on\nthe HYPE targets on the way up, invalidating the skill-shot. I'm not even\nsure that the skill shot awards any extra points (anyone know?)\nBonus multipliers\nDrop all 3 XYZ targets to advance bonus multipliers. On liberal, with\nevery completion of XYZ, the game awards Bonus X, then 25K, then special\n(2X, 3X, 5X, 25K, Special). On conservative, the game lights the next award\non one completion, then awards it the next completion. Also, depending\non the game settings, this certain special can be awarded once per game,\nor alternate between 25K and Special. If the 3 targets are dropped in order,\none Defender drop target is scored and dropped.\nDefender Drop targets\nOn game start, the top row of 3 targets resets. If that row is completed\nIN ORDER, the Vectorscan ramp is then lit for a lock. If it is completed\nout of order, the lower 3 drop targets reset. Depending on settings, the\nlower targets can never reset after completing the top 3, reset depending\non the order of completion, or always reset. Certain other game features\ndrop these targets.\nInlanes (those that feed to the flippers)\nThese score 1 Bonus light, 3K on Vectorscan bonus, and drop 1 Defender\ndrop target when both inlanes are passed through.\nBonus Saucers\nAward the bonus lights, but no multipliers are taken into effect.\nHYPE Targets\nWhen scored IN ORDER, these targets light all of the Vectorscan Ramp\nbonus lights (the lights on the Vectorscan lane), and increase the Vectorscan\nbonus multiplier. When scored out of order, the targets award one Vectorscan\nRamp bonus light. Each target adds one to the Bonus lights. If a ball is\nor balls are locked, then completing HYPE in order releases the locked\nballs. If it is ball 5, however, then completing HYPE in any order releases\nonly one ball. (Multiball can also be started from hitting a lit Vectorscan\nramp 3 times.)\nVectorscan ramp\nThis is the biggie. If the ramp is not lit, the game will award a score\ndepending on how fast the ball travelled through the ramp (it may not award\nthat score depending on certain settings). The ball will then be\nkicked out to the upper right flipper. If the ramp is lit, the game\nwill award the Vectorscan flip speed score, and will lock the ball. After\n3 hits to a lit vectorscan ramp, multiball begins. During multiball, the\nVectorscan ramp functions as an effective Jackpot. This is especially true\nif all the Vectorscan Ramp bonus lights are lit from completing HYPE in\norder. During this time, all balls hit through the Vectorscan ramp are\nkicked out to the upper\nright flipper.\nVectorscan flip speed\nIf a flip speed is higher than the fastest flip speed recorded, one\nreplay is awarded (operator adjustable). If it is faster than 750 (or 800\non hard), then one outlane special is lit and an Extra Ball is\nawarded.\nBonus lights (blue)\n1-9,10,20. Maximum is 39. If this is reached, a Special is awarded.\nEnd-of-ball bonus\nFirst the Vectorscan bonus is tallied, then the Bonus lights are tallied.\nBoth of these are done with multipliers in effect. The Vectorscan Ramp\nbonus is NOT scored, as this bonus only applies to shooting the Vectorscan\nramp. Depending on game settings, either one of these bonuses can reset\nball to ball, or can count up through the whole game.\n\n\nQuotes\n\nI am always amazed at the amount of quotes the game has, so I don't particularly\nwant to go through every one and state where it occurs, so I'll just list\nthe quotes. If you really want to know where they come from, e-mail me.\n\"I am a P.A.C...Play Analysis Computer...For your Vector game plan\"\n\"Vector\"\n\"Take aim, rookie\"\n\"Shoot for Vectorscan\"\n\"Great shot\"\n\"Incredible shot\"\n\"New Vectorscan record\"\n\"Energy stored\"\n\"Macro power\"\n\"Offense released\"\n\"Defense in position\"\n\"Defenders down\"\n\"Great save\"\n\"Resume play\"\n\"Hit the showers\"\nThere are other quotes that are on the sound ROMs that are either not\nin the game or there's a totally new section of rules I haven't discovered.\nIf you know where these occur, please e-mail me.\n\"Welcome to Vectordome\"\n\"Stand by for Vectorscan\"\n\"Super shot\"\n\"Shoot for HYPE targets\"\n\"Period completed\"\n\"Strategy changed\"\n\"Shoot for Z\" ***Note: I recently heard this quote while playing\nthe game.

That's where the points are. Here's\nmy strategy:\n1. Drop all the Defender drop targets\n2. Capture 2 balls.\n(Do these two in the first ball and you're set)\n3. Increase Bonus multiplier to 5X\n4. Hit HYPE targets in order (In order so that you get a 2X vectorscan\nbonus\nvalue, light all the Vectorscan Ramp bonus lights, and release the\nballs).\n5. Instead of trying to keep balls in play, go for the Vectorscan ramp.\nThis\nis worth at least 100K a shot, probably a lot more.\n6. Increasing Bonus lights is also important\n7. There's really nothing else in the game. (The right ramp target\nis not\nreally worth a lot unless you can hit it consistantly.)\nAlso, if you are having trouble hitting the Defender drop targets in\norder, then try hitting them with the upper-left flipper. Since this flipper\nis very close, it is very accurate when hitting the Defender drop targets.\nUsually, the\nright-most drop target is the easiest to hit with this flipper, and\nthe left-most is the hardest.\n\n\nFinal\n\nThank you to everyone who has helped me fix my Vector on rec.games.pinball.\nAlso, thanks to everyone who is reading this (and finds it helpful). As\nI stated before, feel free to e-mail with questions, comments, or corrections.\nI would also appreciate if anyone wants to give me a lesson in rulesheet-making,\nso I might be able to expand the rulesheet and give better information.\nRyan Avery\nRyan.Avery@Colorado.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Vector", "possible_shots": "Inside left lane, Collect Bonus Saucer (left), Outside left lane, Defender drop targets, Upper Left Flipper, Vectorscan ramp, Energy Storage Pods, Upper Right Flipper, XYZ drop targets, Right ramp, Middle ramp, Middle-Left ramp, HYPE targets, Right outlane, Right inlane, Right Bonus Saucer, Flippers, Plunger", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/vector.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Vector", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: Waterworld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Waterworld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Joel Iott\n\n\nGottlieb/Premier's latest machine \"Waterworld\" has just shown up on\ntest at Town & Country.\n\nThe game is based on the movie that just opened Friday in the US.  The\nbackglass features two large heads of the movie stars - Kevin Costner\nand Dennis Hopper (similar to Demolition Man).\n\nThe big toy on the game is a half-pipe ramp and a suspended boat. The\nboat is mostly flat, and has two surfaces (flat top & flat bottom).\nIt's mounted on a spit similar to what would be used to roast meat. A\nmotor can turn the boat to have either surface on top.\n\nThe half-pipe ramp is a large ramp about 6 inches wide and 6 inches\nhigh.  The ramp is a half-cylinder in shape, and shots up the half-pipe\nwill land in the boat. There's some plastic on the ramp to make it look\nlike a cresting wave (I think). The ramp is mounted in the upper middle\nof the playfield, at the end of a wide lane with pop bumpers.\n\nIn one mode, you lock 3 balls in the boat. There are no actual\nswitches in the boat, so the game relies on optos in the half-pipe to\ntell it when the balls have remained in the boat. The boat turns to\ndump out the balls to start multiball.\n\nWhen the boat does not lock balls, shots up the ramp will either return\nto the left flipper (and spell WATERWORLD) or drop down the center\nscoring nothing.\n\nOther features of the playfield are a lane on the left (think Fish\nTales reel without the reel) called the \"Harpoon\" lane that will give\nawards.  It is difficult to get the ball in this area on purpose,\nexcept by the special \"Curvy\" lane.  The harpoon kicker seemed to have\nproblems getting the ball up the 180 degree return wireform.\n\nThe \"curvy\" lane is on the extreme right behind a target, and can only\nbe hit off the tip of the left flipper.  A strong shot to this lane\ncan end up in the harpoon lane.\n\nThe game features left and right orbits, and a diverter can open to\ncatch left orbit shots.  A small \"jet-ski\" toy will raise up on right\norbit shots.  This looks just like the Stargate \"raising guard\" targets\nwithout the actual target that the ball hits - in other words, the\njet-ski is for show only, no ball interaction.\n\nThe last major playfield feature is the \"dive hole\", which is a very\ndeep sinkhole that is pretty easy to shoot.  The dive hole is hexagonal\nin shape.  The dive hole's main purpose is to give one of 9 awards.\n\n9 awards are arranged in a 3x3 grid in the center of the playfield.  4\nof the awards are \"Feature\" which gave Player's Choice.  Usually one of\nthe choices would be \"Super Hint\" which seemed to be help information!\nThe center award is Jackpot, and the remaining 4 are various awards.\nLighting a line or the four corners lights other modes.\n\nThe thing you collect and trade in this game is \"Dirt\" (!) which is\ndefinitely the strangest trading material so far.  Premier has very\nhelpfully listed the various trade-in values for Dirt on the bottom\narch, which is a big improvement over the mystery trade in values of\nStargate, etc.\n\nThere's the usual Jackpots, Super Jackpots, combos, etc. common to the\nlatest Premier games.\n\nThe flippers seemed a little different than usual.  In the resting\nposition, they seemed to be a little higher than normal.  It was still\nvery easy to catch balls with them.\n\nThere is no auto-plunger on this game, so multiball modes are two balls\nonly, except for the boat-locking multiballs which are four ball\nmultiballs.\n\nMy first impression of the game was that it wasn't all that exciting.\nThe half-pipe is so wide that it's easy to loop it to spell Waterworld\nor lock balls in the boat.  The lack of an auto-plunger means that\nthere are no additional balls spit out into play like Stargate and Big\nHurt, which I enjoyed on those games.  The harpoon lane is difficult to\nhit on purpose, so the game seems to be consist of 4 shots - the\norbits, the wide ramp, and the dive hole.  This is only a first\nimpression, and I'll follow up when I've played the game some more.\n\n--\nJoel Iott\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Waterworld", "manufacturer": "Gottlieb/Premier", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/waterworld.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Waterworld", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I wrote a review on\nrec.games.pinball\njust after I bought the game: I liked it then, and now after may hours\nof play my opinion hasn't diminished at all.\nThe Web combines the two crucial elements in pinball, one or both of\nwhich are lacking in most pinball simulations: it has a great\nplayfield design and sensible, balanced rules.  On top of this, it has\nrealistic ball and flipper behaviour, and a nice user interface to boot.\nUnlike just about all pinball sims in recent years, The Web has\nabandoned scrolling and instead gives a three-dimensional players-eye\nview of the playfield (with a choice of six different viewing\nangles).  The playfield is rendered from a highly detailed 3-d model\nof the playfield and includes lighting, shadows and reflections (even\non the ball!).  The design itself is in the Ritchie style with plenty\nof fun, high-paced shots; it's sort of like a reversed ST:TNG, with\ntouches of HS2 and Rollergames thrown in.  The rules, too, are well\ndesigned and nicely balanced, with lots of parallel goals leading\ntowards a challenging Wizard mode.  There's a great sound package with\nsome cool music and quotes (although the sound effects aren't quite up\nto WMS standard), and some nifty DMD animations too.\nOb-Brag: My best so far (and given the amount I've played it, it's a\nfairly disappointing best) is 15.5B regulation (that's with starting,\nbut not completing, the Ultimate Showdown) and 17.5B buy-in.  The Combo\nChampion stands at 10 Combos; the Loop champion is 11 (yes, 11!) loops.\nI'm sure most can do better. :)\nThis rulesheet corresponds to Version 1.10E of The Web.  Changes in\nfrom version 1.00E are listed below.  An upgrade\nfrom 1.00E is available from the Empire Interactive website.\n\nPlayfield\n\nPlayfield description starts, as customary, from the flippers and\nproceeds clockwise.\nI include this section mainly to give names to the shots and describe\ntheir basic purpose.\n\n Flippers\n Judging from the apparent dimensions of the playfield, these\nseem to be almost identical to the standard Williams flipper (except\nfor the small `e' near the flipper heel).  White with black rubber.\n Left Slingshot\n A perfectly ordinary slingshot.  (The detail here is amazing,\nincidentally: you can even see the heads of the Phillips-head screws\nused to bolt it down.)\n Left inlanes\n Actually, a Lawlor-style `twinlane'.  The left inlane briefly\nlights `power' on the right orbit.  The right\ninlane briefly lights `Light Magnet' at the explosion hole.  Both briefly light the 'Light\nKickback' target.\n Left outlane\n Includes a kickback, which returns the\nball to play when lit or flashing.  May also be lit for Extra Ball\nwith an Explosion Award.\n Lock hole\n A small sinkhole just below the upper flipper.\nIt's recessed slightly into the playfield wall so it's only\nshootable with a direct shot from the tip of the right flipper.  Can\nbe lit for Frenzy Lock or for Video\nMode.  Also has a Spider light.\n Left popper\n A VUK which feeds into the habitrail from the Bike ramp, and\nthus feeds into the leftmost left inlane.  Shots to the Lock hole\nand the Mission Start hole (usually) appear here.\n Upper flipper\n On the left hand side, just above the Lock hole at the entrance\nto the left orbit.  Used for shots to the Dock ramp and the Loop.\nShots to Reactor hole or the Explosion hole may also be attempted.\n Grab magnet\n Situated under the playfield near the tip of the upper flipper\nis a magnet used to trap the ball for a clean shot to the Dock ramp\n(like in Rollergames).  It's lit by shooting the Explosion hole when\nlit (which feeds to the upper flipper).\n Left Orbit and Spinner\n A Ritchie-style orbit which leads between the upper flipper and\nthe Bike ramp around the back of the table and exits out the Right\nOrbit (although weak shots may dribble into the Rollover Lanes or\neven out the Loop).  Used for increasing the Power Level (when the yellow Power light is\nlit), and the Spider light is used in some modes.\n Bike (Left) Ramp\n The Bike ramp is a short steep ramp which does a 180-degree turn\nnear the back of the playfield and leads to the leftmost left\ninlane.  (Very similar to the Beta Quadrant on ST:TNG, but on the\nother side).  Shots to this ramp count\ntowards lighting Lock.  The ramp is also used\nin some modes (it also has a Spider light).\n x2 Bike targets\n Two small standups at either side of the entrance to the Bike\nramp, these targets act identically to the 2x Shuttle targets on\nST:TNG.  When hit, they flash for a short time.  Shooting the Bike\nRamp when one is flashing awards 2 ramp shots instead of just one;\nwhen both are flashing 4 ramps shots are awarded.\nBumper lane\nA small lane out of which the ball may drain from the Jet Bumper\narea, but a careful shot to this lane may be used to send the ball\ninto the jets as well.  Has a red `Super Jets' light; shoot\nthis lane (from below) when flashing to increase the\nSuper Jets level.\n Mystery target\n A round standup with a yellow `?' light.  Used in some\nmissions, and advances the lit mission.\n Jet Bumpers\n Your usual triangle of three jet bumpers.  They flash when Super Jets is active, and during the Ammo Dump mission.  Hold down both flipper\nbuttons to disable the jets; this is useful during timed modes when\nyou don't want to waste time with the ball rattling in the jets.\n Rollover Lanes\n Three rollover situated above the Jet Bumpers (like T2).  Each\nhas a green light; roll over a lane to light one; light all three to\nadvance bonus.  Change the lit lanes with\nthe flippers.  Note there is no real shot to these lanes, but a weak\nshot to the Loop often ends up in them.\n Mission Start hole\n A sinkhole dead centre at the back of the playfield.  Very\nsimilar to the Mode Start hole in ST:TNG except the metal guide wall\nis to the left, making shots from the right flipper easy.  (Shots\nfrom the left flipper are difficult, but not impossible.)  Shots\nhere normally feed to the left popper, but in some modes feeds to\nthe right instead.  Can be lit for Start Mission or Start Mode and\nfor Extra Ball.  This is the Jackpot shot\nduring Multiball.  There's a Spider Light for\nthis shot, too.\n Reactor hole\n A sinkhole framed by the two sets of Reactor Drop targets,\nshootable from the left flipper or (with luck) from the upper\nflipper.  Used during the Reactor Critical\nmission, and spots drop targets to light Dock.  Can be lit for Light Magnet, and also has a Spider light.  Shots here\nemerge at the Right Popper.\n Reactor Drop Targets\n Two sets of three drop targets on either side of the Reactor\nhole.  When either set of three drop, they are reset.  Used to light\nDock, light Light Magnet, and during the Reactor Critical mission.\n The Loop\n A small orbit whose entrance is between the Dock Ramp and the\nright set of Reactor Drops.  Feeds around the back to the upper\nflipper for repeated shots (when the Loop\nlight lights).  Weak shots usually end up in the Rollover lanes.\nHas a Spider light, too.\n Dock ramp\n A steep ramp on the right side of the playfield about 2/3 of\nthe way up, with an entrance facing left for shots from the upper\nflipper.  Leads into the Space Station (a large blue plastic model\nabove the Start Mission hole) where the ball is locked if Dock is\nlit, and to either the left or right inlane if it is not.  May be\nlit for the Super or Ultra jackpot during Multiball.  Has a Spider light.\n Explosion hole\n A small sinkhole just below the entrance to the Dock ramp.  May\nbe lit for an Explosion award, and has a\nSpider light (used during some missions).  The shot feeds (via a\nVUK) to a short habitrail which leads across the playfield and\ndeposits the ball just above the upper flipper.  When the small\nmagnet-shaped lamp near the explosion hole is lit, the grab magnet\nactivates for a clean shot at the Dock ramp.\n Right orbit and Spinner\n The mirror image of the Left orbit.  Shots here end up\nscreaming out the Left Orbit, although weak shots may end up in the\nRollover Lanes.\n Light Kickback target\n A large standup just above the right slingshot.  Either\nleft inlane briefly lights it to relight kickback (very similar to WCS).\n Right outlane\n May be lit for Extra Ball (Special?)\n Right inlane\n Briefly lights Power at the Left Orbit.  Shots from the Reactor\nHole and (sometimes) from the Dock ramp feed here.\n Right slingshot\n Another perfectly ordinary (albeit virtual) slingshot.\n Centre playfield lamps\n Between the flippers there is a Shoot Again lamp, with a Ball\nSaver flashing lamp above that.  Just above those is a triangle of\nsix green lamps for the Missions; lit lamps\nare completed missions, and the flashing lamp is the next or current\nmission.  Above those is five white lights in a circle marked\n(clockwise from top) Missions, Power, Ultra, Bonus and Combos, with\na red lamp marked The Ultimate Showdown in the centre.\n\n\nThe Rules\n\nThese rules correspond to version 1.10E of The Web.  See below for rule changes from 1.00E.\n\nInstruction card\n\nOn the playfield poster included with the game is a short instruction\ncard as you'd expect to find on a real pinball machine:\n\nSpace Station Frenzy Shoot all drop targets to light dock.\nDock 3 balls to start Frenzy and score jackpots.\nFast Frenzy Shoot the web ramp repeatedly to light lock.  Shoot\nlock to start Frenzy and score fast jackpots.\nMissions Shoot the centre sinkhole to activate missions.\nPower Levels Inlanes light spinners.  Shoot lit spinners to\nadvance power levels and light awards.\nThe Arena  Shoot consecutive loops to light extra balls and\nbonus held.\nThe Ultimate Showdown  Complete \"missions\", \"combos\", \"power\",\n\"bonus\" and \"ultra\" to begin the Ultimate Showdown.\n\nThat about sums it up really, but if you want more detail, read on...\n\nBasics\n\nThree balls per game, plus extra balls earned.\nThere is a fairly long ball-saver with each ball; if you drain while\nthe red \"Ball Saver\" light is flashing your ball will be returned to\nplay.  (You don't get another shot at the Skill Shot, however.)  The\nballsaver also lights for a shorter period after balls are launched\nfollowing a lock, and also at the start of any multiball.\nFlippers are activated with the Control or Shift keys; hold one\nflipper for the Status Report; press both to make selections (Return\nalso works for this), cancel Buy-In, and disable the Jets (while\nheld).  Return launches a ball.  Press `S' to start a 1-player game.\nPressing 'S' during Ball 1 adds players (to a maximum of 4); 'S'\nstarts a new game on later balls.  Use 'C' to buy in (if credits are\navailable) at the end of the game.  In version 1.30, 'P' may be used\nto pause the game.\nBall Rescue\nThe kickback (Ball Rescue) is lit at the start of each ball; it\nunlights if the ball goes down the left outlane (and is kicked back\ninto play).  However, the kickback will never unlight if the ball\nsaver is still lit (yaay!).  Relight the kickback by shooting the Light Kickback target immediately after rolling\nthough either left inlane.  The `Super Ball Rescue' award keeps the\nkickback lit until the end of the current ball, with one exception:\nSuper Ball Rescue ends after Space Station\nFrenzy, leaving the kickback normally lit.  (NB: this is a\nfeature, not a bug.)\nCredits and high scores\nThe game keeps a record of credits earned through replays (the replay\nscore reflexes) and high score awards, to a maximum of 9 credits.  It\ndoesn't cost you an credits to start a game, but at the end of the\ngame, if you have any credits, you can choose to buy an extra ball\n(press `C'), but any high scores will then go into the \"Bought In High\nScores\" table, and you will be ineligible for the Grand Champion\nscore.  You can keep buying in as long as you have credits in store.\n\nSkill shot\n\nShoot the Dock ramp immediately after launch for\na Skill Shot award of 25M on the first ball, increasing by 25M.\nAlternatively, go for the Super Skill Shot by shooting the Loop followed by the Dock ramp for double the\ncurrent skill shot value, and advance the skill shot value by 25M\n(this was 50M before 1.10E).\nThe skill shot is available at the beginning of all balls (regulation,\nextra and bought), but not after locked balls.\n\nPower Levels\n\nThe leftmost left inlane and the right inlane briefly light the right\nand left spinners to increase the Power level.  The first award is\nPower Level 1, then Power Level 2, up to Power Level 8.  Note that\nalthough the award lamps are split between the left (odd) and right\n(even) orbits, you don't need to alternate shots to collect\npower awards.  The awards, in order, are:\n\n Power Level 1: 5 million (the display says Small Points\n:))\n Power Level 2: Explosion (lights the Explosion Hole for\nan Explosion Award)\n Power Level 3: Super Jets (lights the Jet Bumpers for 1M a pop)\n Power Level 4: Light Quick shot (lights the Quick Shot mode at the Mission Start hole)\n Power Level 5: Light Video mode (lit at the Lock hole)\n Power Level 6: Super Ball Rescue (kickback lit (light flashes) for the rest of the current ball)\n Power Level 7: Light Super Launcher (lights Super Launcher mission at the Mission Start hole)\n Power Level 8: Showdown Sphere (awards one Showdown\nSphere)\n\nPower Level 8 also lights the \"Power\" light for Ultimate Showdown.  The first award is always\nPower Level 1 at the start of each ball.  Note that only the spinner\nneeds to be tripped to collect a lit Power Award; you don't need to\ncomplete the entire orbit.  This means that a strong shot to the\nwrong orbit will collect a lit power award at the exit spinner.\nYou can even collect two Power Levels almost simultaneously by rolling\nover both inlanes in quick succession and then shooting a complete\norbit.  Also, complete shots to an orbit light the orbit briefly for\nPower Level, so repeated shots to the orbits accumulate power levels.\nIn version 1.10E, power levels above level 8 award 1M*power level,\ni.e. after level 8 power levels award 9M, 10M, 11M etc., but there's\nno associated quote.\n\nCombos\n\nAny of the non-sinkhole Spider shots (left and right orbits, Dock\nramp, Bike ramp and Loop) shot in succession count as a Combo.  (After\nyou shoot one of these shots, the Spider light on the next shot(s) in\nsequence for a combo flashes.)  Two shots in a row is a Combo; three\nshots in a row is a Double Combo, four shots in a row is a Triple\nCombo and any further shots score a Super Combo, all for increasing\namounts of points.  Note that the Loop only advances the Combo one\nlevel (the Right Orbit lights both the Loop and the Dock ramp for the\nnext combo, but the Loop only lights the Dock ramp); repeated shots\ndon't score further shots but subsequently shooting the Dock ramp\ncontinues the Combo sequence where you left off.\nCombos scored are counted, and count towards bonus.  In addition, Combo Mania is lit every 12 combos (the\nnumber required to light it is displayed when a combo is scored).\nThe person to shoot the most shots in succession gets to\nenter his or her initials as the Combo Champion.\n\nMissions\n\nThe Mission Start hole is normally lit for Start Mission at the\nbeginning of each ball (although lit Modes take precedence).  When\nlit, shoot the Mission Start hole to start the currently flashing\nmission.  In general, missions last about 45 seconds and require a\ncertain number of shots to be completed within the time limit to\ncomplete the mission.  The Spider lights indicate which shots need to\nbe hit (except for the Ammo Dump mission).  If\na Mission is successfully completed, a Showdown Sphere is awarded (as\nwell as maximum points for the mission).  After a Mission ends, the\nmission total is displayed, and either Ramp must be shot before\nMission Start will be lit again.\nThe lit mission is advanced with the Jet Bumpers or with the Mystery\ntarget.\nThe mission descriptions proceed in the order of the playfield lights,\nfrom the top down and right to left.\nReactor Critical\nShoot the Reactor drop targets to insert control rods in the reactor\nto shut it down.  Ten drops are required (the drop targets all reset\nafter each shot); however shooting the Reactor Hole removes two\nrods, requiring another two drop targets.  Each drop awards 5M.\nThe Mystery target lights during this mode, and unlights the radiation\nlamp at the reactor hole, preventing it from removing rods if you\nshoot it. Once ten rods have been inserted, shoot the Reactor Hole to\ncontain the reactor and collect a Showdown Sphere.\nBiker Race\nIt's a bike race through the streets!  Shoot the lit shot (which\ntravels through the Bike Ramp, Dock Ramp, Right Orbit and Left Orbit\nbefore repeating) to bump your opponent -- four bumps and you win.\nThe Loop is also lit at the start of the mode and awards one bump\n(relight it by shooting the traveling shot).  The Mystery target\nlocks the traveling shot in place until you collect it.  A bump\nawards 10M, with 60M bonus (i.e. a 100M total) for completing the mode.\nHunt Down\nShoot lit sinkholes (Mission Start, Reactor Hole, Explosion Hole and\nLock Hole) to catch whoever it is you are chasing.  One hole is lit at\na time, but the Mystery target lights all holes until one is\ncollected.  Five holes to apprehend the target for 100M and a Showdown\nSphere.\nShuttle\nFire guns at the shuttle by shooting either the Dock ramp or the Bike\nramp.  About four shots are required to destroy the shuttle and\ncomplete the mission for 105M and a Showdown Sphere; the percentage\ncompleted is displayed on the DMD.  The Dock ramp awards a greater\npercentage than the Bike ramp, and the value of both ramps increases\nas the mode progresses.  The Mystery Target lights after a successful\nramp shot; shoot it when lit to award one free ramp shot.\nSkyscraper\nShoot the spinners to climb the floors of the building, from the first\nfloor to the fifth floor (five shots).  While you only need to trip\nthe spinner to advance a floor, the spinners unlight for a few seconds\nafter a successful shot so a complete orbit only advances one floor.\nEach floor awards 1M and advances the mission total (displayed on the\nDMD).  You can exit the elevator to collect the mission total (and\nfinish the mode) at any time by shooting the Mission Start hole, but\nonly by exiting on the fifth floor will you collect the Showdown\nSphere and the mission maximum of 105M.  The Mystery target lights\nafter reaching floor 5 and relights the spinners to move to floor 6\n(with the appropriate quote, even!).  Exiting at floor 6 awards an\nExtra Ball, as well as 100M.  I love the elevator\nmusak in this mode!\nAmmo Dump\nShoot the pop bumpers to destroy the ammo dump.  25 shots are\nrequired, but the Mystery Target makes pops worth double.  The\ncompleted mission (without using the Mystery target) is worth 95M (and\na Showdown Spere).\nAll Missions Completed\nOnce all six missions have been completed, there is a seventh\n'mission' to get.  The six Mission lights on the playfield cycle to\nindicate all missions have been completed; re-light Mission Start as\nnormal and shoot the Mission Start hole for 250M and a Showdown\nSphere.\nAfter relighting Mission Start with a ramp shot (as usual) you can\nthen replay all the missions as before.  Each time through the\nmissions increases their value (2x the original value, then 3x, etc.),\nincluding the completion award.  So the 2nd time through, every target\nis worth double what it was before, all modes will be about 200M for\nfinishing, and the completion bonus is 500M.\n\nModes\n\nIn addition to Missions, there are Modes may be lit at various points\nin the game.  Modes are started at the Mission Start hole when the red\narrow is flashing.  Modes take priority over the missions, and are\nstarted in the order they are lit.  Lit modes carry between balls.\nQuick Shot\nLit at power level 4.  Shoot the lit orbit for the hurry-up value,\nwhich decreases rapidly.  (You must shoot the complete orbit, not just\nthe spinner.)  The first quick shot is worth 25M max; collecting a\nquick shot (at any value) makes the next one start at 50M more (so\nit's worth collecting a quick shot even if it's about to time out).\nLighting Quick Shot again increases the value by 25M (even if you\ndon't start it: if you light Quick Shot the first time, then drain, then\nlight it again before starting it, the initial value is 50M).\nCuriously, you can't advance Power Levels during Quick Shot.\nSuper Launcher\nLit at Power Level 7.  A 10-second timer starts counting down; shoot\nthe Dock ramp before time runs out to destroy the space ship for 50M\nand restart the timer for another shot; the value increases by 25M\neach time to a maximum of 150M, where the mode ends immediately and\nawards a Showdown Sphere.  The Magnet is always lit during this mode,\nbut Dock is not available.  The base value and the increment increases\nby 25M each subsequent time you start Super Laucherm, so the second\nrun of this mode in a game is worth 75M+50M for each destroyed ship;\nand it's worth big points indeed at 150M+125M!\nCombo Mania\nLit after 12 Combos have been collected.  This\nis a 1-ball timed mode, where all Combo shots remain lit (so `1-way\nCombos' are possible).  Combos score 25M, Double combos 50M, Triples\n75M and Super Combos score 100M to a max of 150M (five combos).  The\nbase combo value increases by 5M each time you subsequently start\nCombo Mania.  Needless to say, this can be a very lucrative mode.\n\nMultiball: Space Station Frenzy\n\nShoot all six drop targets to light Dock at the Dock ramp.  The yellow\nlights indicate which drops remain to be hit.  The Reactor hole, and\nre-completing an already completed 3-bank spots a target in the other\nbank.  (These rules don't seem to change for subsequent multiballs, so\nstarting multiball never gets any more difficult.)  When lock is lit,\nshoot the Dock ramp to lock three balls to start Multiball.\nMultiball (Space Station Frenzy) starts immediately when the third\nball is locked.  It is normally a three-ball multiball, but there's a\nsecret way of increasing the number to\nfour.\nThe goal of Multiball is to score the Ultra jackpot, which proceeds as\nfollows:\n\n Shoot the Mission start hole for single jackpot\n Shoot the Mission start hole for double jackpot\n Shoot the Mission start hole for triple jackpot.  Until the\nSuper or Ultra jackpot is collected, the Mission Start hole\ncontinues to score single jackpots.\n Shoot the Dock ramp for Super jackpot (5x).  (NB: The mission start\nhole now scores single-double-triple jackpots to re-light Super Jackpot.)\n Complete the drop targets, which lights the Explosion hole (\"You're close!\")\n Shoot the explosion hole (the Spider will be lit) and then Dock\nramp for Ultra Jackpot (10x). However, if you shoot the Reactor Hole\n(`Oh No...') before the Dock ramp, the explosion hole unlights and\nyou must re-complete the drop targets.  If you miss the Ultra\nJackpot, the Explosion hole relights until you shoot it again, or\nhit the Reactor Hole.\n\nScoring the Ultra Jackpot lights the `Ultra' light towards the\nUltimate Showdown.\nThe base Jackpot value is 10M, and can be increased during normal play\nby shooting the Jet Bumpers or the unlit Dock ramp.  The Jackpot value\naccumulates during the game; it never decreases.\n\nFast Frenzy\n\nThe Bike ramp lights Lock at the Lock Hole every\nfive ramp shots.  Shoot the Lock Hole when lit to select your\naward.  `2', `3' and `4' are the number of balls in the Frenzy; the\nfirst is locked now, and the remainder must be locked before the\ncurrent ball ends to start the Fast Frenzy.  Although lock will\nremain lit between balls if no balls have been locked yet (i.e. you\nhaven't made a selection), it will unlight at the end of the ball if\nyou haven't locked the requisite number of balls, and you will have to\nre-light Lock at the ramp and start again.\nFast Frenzy is a fairly simple multiball: shoot Mission Start when lit\nto score a Jackpot, and shoot the drops to light or build the jackpot\nvalue.  When scored, the jackpot must be re-lit before it can be\nscored again.  The base Jackpots value is balls-in-play *\n(balls-at-start-of-frenzy + 1M * Frenzies started), and is multiplied\nby the number of drop targets down except when all 6 are down\nwhen a 10x Jackpot is awarded.  The drops reset when a jackpot is\ncollected.  Clearly, a 4-ball multiball is much more lucrative than a\n2-ball (but correspondingly difficult to start).  While not a always a\nparticularly high-scoring round (especially for early 2 or 3-ball\nFrenzies), the quotes are great.  (\"I'm impressed!\")\nFor a description of the `?' option, and how to get a 6-ball Fast\nFrenzy, see Easter Eggs below.\nFast Frenzy ends when there are less than two balls in play.\n\nVideo Mode\n\nVideo Mode is lit at by collecting Power Level\n5 (or possibly from an Explosion award).  Start it by shooting the\nLock Hole when lit.\nThis is a fast and surprisingly exciting video mode.  The idea is to\nshoot the approaching mines, but avoid shooting awards (and let them\nhit you instead).  The objects appear to the left or right of centre,\nand you have to use the corresponding flipper button to shoot them\ndown.  You begin with five lives; letting a mine hit you, or shooting\nthe funny atom-shaped object loses you a life.  The awards are spheres\nwith `5' written on them; let them hit you (don't shoot 'em!)  for 5M.\nThere's also an extra ball (EB) towards the end of the wave, and\nshooting it is a Bad Idea ('Oh Dear...').\nLater waves are the same, except you start with one less life each\ntime you play (to a minimum of one life, i.e. 2 hits), but are worth\ncorrespondingly more as all awards are multiplied by the wave number\n(number of times you started video mode), except the 5M spheres.\nMines score 1M*wave; score 2M*wave for collecting atoms.  Completion\nawards a Showdown Sphere plus 100M*wave, or 250M*wave (!) for a\nperfect completion (by shooting all mines, but no\nspheres or atoms).  This is pretty difficult, as the video mode speeds\nup a lot as you progress.\n\nExplosions and The Magnet\n\nThere is an under-playfield magnet just in front of the tip of the\nupper flipper which is used to grab the ball for a clean shot at the\nDock ramp.  The idea is to shoot the Explosion Hole when the Magnet is\nlit (the small magnet-shaped light).  The magnet activates and the ball\nis dropped near the magnet which grabs it.  You wait a bit for the\nball to settle and at the \"Fire!\" cue, you flip, hitting the ball and\nneatly sending it up the Dock ramp.  Pressing the left flipper button\ncancels the magnet.\nThe magnet is lit at the start the game and by completing the 6\nreactor drop targets during normal play (lights Light Magnet at the\nReactor Hole) and then shooting the Reactor Hole itself.  During multiball play, you only need to complete a single\n3-bank to light Light Magnet.\nThe Magnet is also momentarily lit at the Explosion Hole after the\nball travels through the rightmost left inlane.  Shooting the\nExplosion Hole immediately lights the Magnet as usual, but also lights\nDock for a very short period.  Shooting Dock before it times out\nscores one Dock, but leaves Dock unlit.\nThe Explosion Hole also gives Explosion Awards when lit (at Power\nLevel 2).\nSome of the awards I've seen include: \n Special\n Light outlanes\n Extra Ball lit\n Extra Ball\n Power level\n Super Jets\n Super Jets Held\n Video mode lit\n Video mode activated (plays immediately)\n Quick Shot lit\n Advance bonus X\n Bonus Held\n 30 second saver (Ball Rescue lit for 30 seconds)\n Magnet ready\n Explosion ready (whee!)\n Super Ball Rescue\n Fast Frenzy (immediate 3-ball multiball)\n\n\nSuper Jets\n\nWhen Super Jets is active, the jet bumpers are worth 1M, 2M or 3M a\npop (the amount corresponds to the number of bumpers that are flashing).\nThe Super Jets value is advanced with a Super Jets award from the\nExplosion Hole or at Power Level 3.  It can\nalso be advanced by shooting the small lane below the jet bumpers when\nthe red light (\"Super Jets\") is flashing; you do this by\nshooting the same lane when it's unlit.  In short, shooting the\nlane twice in fairly short order advances the Super Jets value.\nNormally, the Super Jets value resets to zero (off) at the start of\neach ball.  However, a Super Jets Held award (from Explosions or the Loop)\nmaintains the value to the next ball.  In this case the bumpers will\nbe solidly lit, instead of flashing.\n\nThe Loop\n\nRepeated shots to the Loop are possible, and quite valuable as well!\nFirstly, complete shots around the Loop are counted and accumulated\nduring the game, and are each worth 400K at Fun With Bonus.\nSecondly, consecutive shots around the Loop are counted, and the\nperson to score the most is the Loop Champion.  Three consecutive\nshots awards Bonus Held and four consecutive\nshots awards Super Jets Held.\nBest of all, Extra Balls can be lit from the Loop as well.  The number\nof Loops required is listed in the Status Report.  It starts at 2\nLoops, and increases by 1 Loop every time an Extra Ball is collected\n(by whatever method).  It is obviously very good strategy, then, to\nget the extra ball for 2 loops, then 3 loops, then 4 loops.  After\nthat, then you can get the rest of the extra balls.  If you get an\nextra ball from Bonus X, for example, before the 2-loop one, then it\nwill still go up to 3 loops.  Extra Balls lit from the Loop are\nhurry-up Extra Balls; you must shoot the Mission Start while the EB\nlight is still flashing to collect it.  Unfortunately, the hurry-up\ntimer decreases with the number of loops required to light it, so it's\njust about impossible to collect a 5-loop extra ball.\n\nBike Ramp\n\nShots to the Bike Ramp are counted, much like for the Shuttle ramp in\nST:TNG.  Ordinarily, shots to the Bike Ramp add one ramp shot to the\ntotal, but if one (both) of the 2x lights are flashing or lit the shot\ncounts for 2 (4) ramp shots.  Shooting one of the 2x targets makes it\nflash for a while; shooting the Lock hole when it's not lit for Lock\nor Video Mode and when no mode or mission is running lights one of the\n2x targets until the ramp is shot.\nLock is lit at the Lock hole at 1 ramp and\nevery multiple of 5 ramp shots.  In addition, Extra Ball is lit at 20,\n50, 100 and 150 ramp shots.\n\nBonus\n\nBonus is awarded at the end of each ball (provided you don't tilt).\nBonus is calculated as follows: (400K per loop\n+ 500K per power level collected + 600K per combo) * Bonus Multiplier.\nThe bonus multiplier is advanced (1x - 2x - 4x - 6x - 8x - 10x) by\ncompleting the rollover lanes above the jet bumpers.  (It may also be\nadvanced by a random Explosion award.)\nCompleting the rollovers when the bonus is already at 10x award Bonus\nMaxed for 10M+5M, apparently without limit.  Bonus Maxed (not\n10x bonus) also lights the \"Bonus\" light for Ultimate Showdown.\nThe bonus resets to 1x at the end of the ball, unless Bonus Held is\nscored (from Loops or from an Explosion Award) during the current\nball.  If you have 10x Bonus Held, the Bonus Maxed value will reset to\n10M for the next ball, however.\nOnce per game, the Extra Ball is lit by scoring 10x bonus.\n\nExtra Balls\n\nThis game is littered with extra balls:\n\n 10x bonus (once)\n Video mode (once)\n Bike ramp (20, 50, 100 and 150 ramps)\n Loop (consecutive loops, hurry-up EB)\n Explosion award (maybe)\n Outlanes (maybe)\n Skyscraper raid mission (difficult)\n\nYou can also buy extra balls at the end of the game by pressing\n`C'.  This requires credits (one per extra ball bought) which are\nawarded with replays and high scores.  This is the only use for\ncredits; it doesn't cost you one to start (or re-start) a game.\nBuying in makes your score ineligible for the Grand Champion and\nregular High Scores, but is placed in the Bought-In High Scores table\ninstead.\n\nSecrets and Easter Eggs\n\nLike any good pinball machine, The Web contains several secret modes\nand special surprises (even a cow!).  But of course, it's more fun to\nfind them out for yourself.\n\nChanges in Version 1.10E\n\nThe following changes were introduced between version 1.00E and\nversion 1.10E of The Web:\n\n New backglass (although the old backglass still appears in the\nslide show)\n The Super Skill Shot advances the next skill shot value by 25M,\nnot 50M\n The Dock ramp advances the Jackpot by 1M, not 750K.\n Video mode is no longer lit at the start of the game.  You can\nsee your score during video mode.\n Score award for power levels after level 8\n Some minor bug-fixes to the game engine\n\nDave M.

If there are any discrepancies, please notify the author.\n\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\nTo move the storm to your area by hitting various direction\ntargets.  Lock two balls, and start Multiball by locking a third\nand/or hitting the 3-toll ramp.\n\nSTARTING THE GAME\nOne to four players can play.  New players can enter the game\nby inserting coins and pressing START until the end of the first\nball.  After that, pressing START aborts the current game for all\nplayers and begins a new one.\n\nPLUNGER SKILL SHOT\nShoot the ball from the plunger to hit one or more of the\n\"FEEL THE POWER\" drop targets.  100K for \"POWER\", 200K for \"THE\"\nand 300K for \"FEEL\".  Hitting more than one target will add their\nvalues together.\n\nSO YOU MESSED UP...\nA launched ball that scores no points before draining will be\nre-served.  This does not apply after locking a ball or if the ball\nbounces into the plunger lane.\n\nMOVING THE STORM\nScattered about the playfield are eight targets.  Two of each: NE\n(Northeast), NW (Northwest), SE (Southeast), and SW (Southwest).\nThese are easily noted by either the letters on them or color: NE/Red,\nNW/Yellow, SE/Orange, and SW/Green.  Depending on the difficulty\nsetting, a target is spotted for the player when he launches his\n'first' ball of each ball.  The targets the player must hit are lit on\nthe compass at the center of the playfield.  Once all these targets\nare hit, lock will lite.\n\nAfter locking ball 1, the player must hit different targets to\nlite lock 2.  After locking ball 2, Multiball will lite.\n\nThe set of targets for the first Multiball can be hit in any\norder.  From the second time on, only one direction can be hit at a\ntime.  Once an orientation has been completed, another will lite.\n\nSKYWAY TOLLS\nSkyway Tolls are cumulative throughout the game.  The number\ncollected and how are:\n\n\n Skyway Ramp -- 1 or 2, depending on status of the \"2 Tolls\" lite.\n Cup -- 1.\n 3-Toll Ramp -- Of course, 3.\n\n\nAt the end of a ball, the player will receive 2K for each\nSkyway Toll collected.  No more than 99 Skyway Tolls can be\ncollected.  If 99 Skyway Tolls are collected, then the player has\ntheir \"SKYWAY PAID FOR\" and receive 200K (Plus a neat little tune)\neach time a ramp is hit.\n\nSKYWAY RAMP (Right)\nThis ramp is used to advance Skyway Tolls and lock balls.  Its\nentrance can be either open(down) or closed(up).\n\nWhen open, the ball will be returned to the left inlane, and\neither one or two Skyway Tolls will be collected.  Going through\nthe left inlane or going up the ramp will briefly lite 2 tolls.\nThe TORNADO DROP TARGET's value will also increase briefly.  The\npoint value of this ramp also increases with each successful run.\nIt starts at 50K and increases by 10K each time up to a maximum of\n100K.\n\nWhen closed, the ball will land in a cup, 1 Skyway Toll will be\nawarded, and the ball will be ejected toward the upper right flipper.\n\nThe ramp's current status depends on a number of things.\nEntering the Super Cellar Door (either lit or not lit) will toggle its\nstatus, unless Multiball of either flavor is lit or in progress - in\nwhich case it will remain closed - or if LOCK is lit.\n\nThe ramp will remain open if LOCK is lit in a 1 player game.  In\na 2, 3, or 4 player game, things get a little more complex.  If a\nplayer lites LOCK and the ball she is attempting to lock is less\nthan or equal to the number of physically locked balls, the ramp will\nremain closed.  In this instance, the cup under the ramp acts as the\nLOCK.  If the ball she is attempting to lock is greater than the\nnumber of physically locked balls, the ramp will remain open.  This\nwill physically lock another ball.\n\nThe ramp will be open at the beginning of a player's turn,\nunless one of the above rules applies to keep it closed.\n\n3-TOLL RAMP (Left)\nThis ramp awards 3 Skyway Tolls, spots a target (if LOCK isn't\nlit or Multiball isn't in progress), lites the Super Cellar Door,\nawards Million and/or Million Plus, and starts Multiball.  Its value\nstarts at 50K and increases by 10K each time up to a maximum of 100K.\nThis ramp returns the ball to a point somewhere near the lower SE\ntarget, usually on the right spinning disk.\n\nSUPER CELLAR DOOR (Yellow light)\nTo lite the door temporarily, the ball must traverse the right\ninlane.  To lite it permanently (until awarded), the 3-Toll Ramp must\nbe hit.\n\nDepending on the difficulty level of your machine, this may or\nmay not be lit at the beginning of a ball.\n\nThe possible awards are labeled on the backbox just below the\nscore display.  The value can be changed using the SPINNER located to\nthe right of the Skyway Ramp.\n\nHitting this target will toggle the status of the Skyway Ramp\n(see SKYWAY RAMP).  Also, one Cellar Visit will be awarded.\n\nThe seven awards are:\n\n\n\"LO PRESSURE JETS ALL AT MAXIMUM\"  Will increase the point\nvalue of the Lo Pressure Jets to 5K (flashing).\n\n \"SUPER DOOR SCORE 500,000\"  Increases the player's score by\n500K.\n\n\"EXTRA BALL IS LIT\"  Lites the extra ball target.  Only lit\nuntil collected or ball is lost.\n\n\"DROP TARGET AT MAXIMUM\"  Sets the value of the \"FEEL THE\nPOWER\" drop targets to 100K.\n\n\"QUICK MULTIBALL IS LIT\"  Lites Quick Multiball.\n\n\"MILLION IS LIT\"  Lites the Million shot.\n\n\"HI PRESSURE JETS ALL AT MAXIMUM\"  Will increase the point\nvalue of the Hi Pressure Jets to 5K (flashing).\n\n\nThe Super Cellar Door is disabled during Quick Multiball or\nMultiball.\n\nWhen all seven values have been awarded, all values will flash,\nand the Super Cellar Door will lite.  Entering the Super Cellar Door\nat this point awards the MEGA DOOR BONUS.  MEGA DOOR BONUS awards all\nseven values again as well as 2,000,000 points and lites ONE Special.\n\nOnce the MEGA DOOR BONUS is collected, the Super Cellar Door\nwill only award Cellar Visits until the current ball ends.\n\nTHE CELLAR DOOR (Red light)\nThis target is similar to the SUPER CELLAR DOOR, but will not\naward anything except a Cellar Visit.  Cellar Visits are worth 5K\neach and are cumulative through the entire game.  The point value\nis awarded at the end of each ball.  This is where the ball will\ncome out if the ball enters the CELLAR DOOR or the SUPER CELLAR DOOR.\n\nIt is also used to start Cellar Multiball.  Cellar Multiball is\nonly possible if Multiball was started, and no Million Plus was\nawarded.  Cellar Multiball is basically Multiball with only two balls.\nIf the CELLAR DOOR or SUPER CELLAR DOOR is hit when the red light is\nflashing, Cellar Multiball will begin.\n\n\"FEEL THE POWER\" DROP TARGET\nThese three drop targets are also used for the SKILL SHOT.\nDropping all three of these targets awards the drop value.  It starts\nat 50K and increases to 100K in increments of 10K.  Sweeping (hitting\nall three in succession) awards 100K + current drop value.  The drop\nvalue can be set to 100K immediately by using the SUPER CELLAR DOOR.\n\nTORNADO DROP TARGET\nThis drop target's value varies, depending on trips up the\nSKYWAY RAMP and the time between them.  The initial value of this\ntarget varies depending on the difficulty setting.  The values are\n50K, 75K, 100K, 150K, LITE QUICK MULTIBALL, and EXTRA BALL.  Each\ntrip up the Skyway Ramp lites the next highest value all the way to\nLITE QUICK MULTIBALL.  Point values can be collected more than\nonce, but Quick Multiball can only be collected once each time it\nis lit.  See EXTRA BALLS to see how to lite the EXTRA BALL target.\n\nAfter a certain point, LITE QUICK MULTIBALL can no longer be\nlit.\n\nIf no score is lit, the target scores zilch.\n\nWhen hit, a tone sounds to give you an idea of the current value.\nThe higher the tone, the higher the value.\n\nSPINNER\nThis is located to the right of the Skyway Ramp.  It changes the\ncurrent value of the SUPER CELLAR DOOR.  Each rotation moves the value\n1 \"box\" to the left or right.  Values that have already been awarded\nwill be skipped.\n\nThe value of the SPINNER is briefly increased after the left\ninlane is traversed.\n\nLO/HI PRESSURE JETS\nThese bumpers are like any other jet bumpers on most Williams\ngames.  Their point value is advanced by the platter in front of\nthe center HI PRESSURE JET.  Hitting this target will advance one\njet bumper.  The values are:\n\n\n Unlit -- 1,000\n Lit -- 3,000\n Flashing -- 5,000\n\n\nWhen all bumpers are flashing, the platter is worth 100K.  The\nbumpers can also be maxed out with the SUPER CELLAR DOOR.\n\nTHE FAN and SPINNING DISKS\nWhat makes Whirlwind what it is.  They usually are operational at\nthe same times.  When LOCK of any flavor is lit, or when Multiball of\neither kind is in progress.  The fan does nothing to game play, but\nthe disks will wreak havoc with the ball(s) in play.\n\nQUICK MULTIBALL\nQuick Multiball can be lit from either the TORNADO DROP TARGET or\nthe SUPER CELLAR DOOR.  It is started by locking a ball in the cup\nunder the Skyway Ramp when Quick Multiball is lit.  If none or one\nball is physically locked, then a normal Quick Multiball is started:\n\nDuring Quick Multiball Unlimited Million is lit.  This continues\nuntil one ball is lost.  Direction targets can still be hit during\nQuick Multiball.  The 3-Toll Ramp will award 1,000,000 points, 3\nSkyway Tolls, and spot a direction target (if any need be spotted).\n\nIf two balls are physically locked, then normal Multiball will be\nstarted, except 1,000,000 points will be awarded in addition to each\nMillion Plus.\n\nAfter a certain point, Quick Multiball can no longer be lit from\nthe TORNADO DROP TARGET.\n\nLOCKING A BALL\nThis will vary between one and two player games.  In general, a\nplayer must 'lock' two balls before he can start Multiball.  In a two\nor more player game, if a player does lock two balls, then fails to\nstart Multiball, another player may 'steal' those balls with a Quick\nMultiball.  Basically, before a player can play Multiball, there must\nbe two balls physically locked.  Physically locked balls are those\nthat are sitting in the lock lane on the left hand side of the\nmachine.\n\nLocking a ball will advance the Bonus Multiplier.  The Bonus\nMultiplier will multiply the Skyway Tolls value at the end of a ball.\nThe values are 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X, 6X+Lite Extra Ball, and 6X+Lite\nSpecial.  The bonus multiplier will not exceed 6X.  A player's\nmultiplier will never decrease.\n\n\"FEEL THE POWER\" MULTIBALL\nMultiball is started by locking two balls and then releasing them\nwith a third.  They can be released two ways, by hitting the 3-Toll\nRamp (which will award 1,000,000 points and three Skyway Tolls), or\nlocking a ball in the cup.  The latter will only work up to a point,\nthen Multiball must be started by hitting the 3-Toll Ramp.\n\nDuring Multiball Million Plus will be lit.  Hitting the 3-Toll\nRamp will score 2,000,000 points.  This will increase by 1,000,000\npoints each time to a maximum of 10,000,000 points.  If at least one\nMillion Plus is collected before loosing two balls, normal play will\nresume.  Otherwise, Cellar Multiball will lite.  See CELLAR DOOR (Red\nlight) for details.\n\n3-WAY COMBO\nGoing between the Lo Pressure Jets to the upper right flipper,\naround the Hi Pressure Jets and back to the upper right flipper again\nand finally up the 3-Toll Ramp scores a 3-Way Combo (plus an awesome\nsiren).  The 3-Way Combo will score only 250K, as well as the current\nvalue of the 3-Toll Ramp.  All these targets must be hit in order,\nwith no other targets in between (except the necessary direction\ntargets and the spinner).\n\nEXTRA BALLS\nExtra Balls will be awarded by hitting the TORNADO DROP\nTARGET when Extra Ball is lit.  There are three ways to lite Extra\nBall:\n\n\nSkyway Tolls  Depending on the setting of your machine, this\ncan be from 5 Skyway Tolls to 50.  Also, the number of 'stops' that\nwill lite it can vary.  For instance these can be 8, 35, 50, and 75.\nOr 35 and 50.  Use the Instant Info feature to find out how many are\nneeded.  A tone will sound to let you know that Extra Ball is lit.\nIt will remain lit until awarded.\nSuper Cellar Door If the current award is \"LITE EXTRA BALL\"\nthen it'll do that.  It will remain lit until awarded or end of\ncurrent ball.\nLocking the 5th ball  Once and only once.  Will remain lit\nuntil awarded.\n\n\nSPECIALS\nSpecials can be collected only from the outlanes.  There are only\ntwo ways to lite Special:\n\n\nMega Door Bonus  Will only remain lit until awarded or current\nball is lost.\nLocking the 6th ball  Once and only once.  A tone will let you\nknow it is lit.  Will remain lit until awarded.\n\n\nIf only one Special lite is lit, the lit lane will toggle between\nleft and right outlanes each time a slingshot it hit.\n\nDIFFICULTY SETTINGS\nLook at the TORNADO DROP TARGET's initial value.  The lower it\nis, the more difficult the settings are.\n\nThe initial values of the Skyway Ramp and 3-Toll Ramp may vary.\n\n5-BALL MACHINES\nI have no idea what options are changed if set for five balls.\nPossibilities are lower bonus values for Skyway Tolls and Cellar\nVisits, and more Skyway Tolls required to lite Extra Ball.\n\nMECHANICAL FAILURES\nSkyway Ramp.  It it is left open (down) and will not rise,\nMultiball and Quick-Multiball can still be started.  If the CPU sees\nthree balls in the lock lane, it will start Multiball.  The Skyway\nRamp will only award one Skyway Toll during Multiball of either type,\nor when the ramp should be closed during regular play.  You will\nnotice sometimes that the 2 Toll lamp will not lite when the ball\nenters the left inlane.  This means that the ramp should be closed\n(raised).  If it is left up and will not lower, don't play.\n\nTORNADO DROP TARGET.  If Extra Ball is lit, and the TORNADO DROP\nTARGET isn't working, the machine will award the EXTRA BALL if there\nis a lot of HI PRESSURE JET activity.  The CPU assumes you may have\nhit the target during that time.  It may do the same for lite Quick\nMultiball.\n\nRamp diverter.  If the diverter fails to lock a ball, LOCK will\nremain lit.  Repeated attempts may get the diverter to work.  If it\ndoesn't, I have no idea what happens.\n\nI've seen some games suddenly launch locked balls during normal\nplay.  If this happens, LOCK will lite so that you have a chance to\nget them back in there.\n\nJim Hoxsey\n2nd edition; January 6, 1995\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Whirlwind", "manufacturer": "Williams Electronic Games, Inc.", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/whirlwind.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Whirlwind", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

It can\nbe modified, updated, or revised, provided only that credit to the original\nauthor(s) remains intact.

The\nauthor(s) disclaim all interest in any trademarks or other intellectual\nproperty referenced herein.\nI do not speak for my employer, my friends, my relatives,\nor my cat.  In fact, I hardly even speak for myself.\n\nI use the abbreviations \"K\" for a thousand points,\n\"M\" for a million points,\n\"B\" for a billion points,\nand \"GC\" for Grand Champion..\n\nThis version of the Guide should be considered final.\n\n\nImportant Things\n\n\nThis is a glossary of the shots and features that will be referred to\nduring the discussion of the game.  It's possible to play this game for\nquite a while and never actually learn the names of a few of these shots.\n\n Flippers\n There are three flippers - the usual two lower ones, and an upper\nright flipper on a raised mini-playfield.  The right flipper button can be\nused to control the right flippers independently, with the second stage of\nbutton action controlling the upper flipper.\n Plunger\n This is a normal plunger.  It is important that it be in good\ncondition for the two-stage skill shot.\n Upper Playfield\n This is the raised mini-playfield where Bigfoot resides.\n Bigfoot\n This is a small furry fellow mounted on the upper playfield.  He\nshould spin his head around on various occasions (this feature breaks\neasily, however), and diverts most balls which go into Bigfoot Bluff into\nthe Whirlpool.\n Bigfoot Bluff\n This is a Hazard.  It is the small upper ramp on the Upper\nPlayfield.  It leads to the Whirlpool or Bigfoot's Cave.\n Whirlpool\n This is a plastic cup (with no scoring sensors) just below the\nUpper Playfield.  Its center hole is ringed by six red lights.\n Bigfoot's Cave\n This is a simple plastic ramp which feeds to the Right\nInlane.  It is only reachable during Bigfoot Hotfoot.\n Insanity Falls\n This is a Hazard.  It is the steep lower ramp on the Upper\nPlayfield.  It leads to the Left Inlane, after a long, gruesome ramp,\nwhich should send the ball into the glass after the third hump.  The\nInsanity Falls is a loop champion shot - the Insanity Record.\n Disaster Drop\n This is a Hazard.  It is the small ramp in the middle of the\nlower playfield.  It loops around underneath the Upper Playfield and drops\nthe ball on the playfield at the entrance to the Boulder Garden Hazard.\n No Way Out\n This is a Hazard.  It is the opening between the two ramps on\nthe lower playfield.  It's a lock shot, and ejects balls onto the Upper\nPlayfield, feeding the upper flipper.\n Spine Chiller\n This is a Hazard.  It is the steep left ramp on the lower\nplayfield.  It leads to the Upper Playfield, feeding the upper flipper.\n Boulder Garden\n This is a Hazard.  It is the far left loop on the lower\nplayfield.  It leads around the back of the machine and to the Jet Bumpers.\n Boomerang Bend\n This is a Hazard.  It is the far right loop on the lower\nplayfield.  It leads around the back of the machine and comes out on the\nentrance to the Boulder Garden Hazard.  It is the reverse of the Boulder\nGarden shot.\n Secret Passage\n This is a rollover switch leading from just past the\nentrance to the Boulder Garden Hazard to the entrance lane of the No Way\nOut Hazard.\n Jet Bumpers\n These are three jet bumpers in the lower right corner of the\nlower playfield.  They are disguised as large boulders.  There are six\nlights on the playfield in this area, indicating the currently lit and\npreviously awarded Whirlpool Awards.\n Extra Ball\n This is a narrow plastic target surrounded by two plastic posts.\nIt's almost directly above the Right Inlane, and just below the Jet\nBumpers.\n Hotfoot\n These are two white plastic targets above the right flipper, facing\ndown and to the left.\n Light Bounceback\n These are three red plastic targets in the center of the\nlower playfield, facing almost directly left.\n Lite Lock\n These are two green plastic targets on either side of the No Way\nOut Hazard.\n R-I-V-E-R\n These are five blue plastic targets on the left side of the lower\nplayfield, facing right.  (On early prototypes, these targets are white.)\n Lost Mine\n This is a kickout above the Left Inlane.  Balls come out of here\nafter landing in the Whirlpool.\n River Class\n These are six lights in the lower left corner of the playfield,\nrepresenting your current River Class.\n Raft Number\n These are nine lights in the middle of the playfield; the\nflashing one represents your current Raft Number, and previously visited\nRafts remain lit until you complete Wet Willie's.\n Bounceback\n This is a kickback on the Left Outlane.\n Outlanes and Inlanes\n These four lanes have rollover switches, of which only\none can be lit at any time.  Change the lit lane by flipping.  Either\nflipper moves the light to the right.   The lane lights are white.\n Slingshots\n There are the usual two above the flippers.\n\n\n\nSkill Shot\n\n\nThe Skill Shot is hitting Insanity Falls after gently plunging the ball onto\nthe Upper Playfield.  Plunging too softly will leave the ball in the plunger\nlane.  Plunging too hard will send it down the Spine Chiller and screaming\ntowards the flippers.  If it doesn't hit a slingshot or roll up into an\ninlane, you haven't scored any points and can let the ball go.  It's best to\navoid this situation entirely, however.  In fact, on\nL-4 and later ROMs, the\nSpine Chiller entrance sensor, tripped in either direction, scores\n5K points\nand eliminates the kindness normally offered for a missed first stage of the\nSkill Shot.\n\nThe Skill Shot is worth 1M\nthe first time, 2M the second, and so on, to a\nmaximum of 5M.\nYou have to watch closely to see the value awarded.\n\n\nHazards and Rafts\n\n\nThere are nine possible raft values: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and Wet\nWillie's.  You begin the game on Raft #2.  You advance to higher rafts by\ncompleting lit Hazards.  At Raft #2, you must complete one lit Hazard to\nadvance the Raft.  At Raft #4, you must complete one or two Hazards - the\nsequence of number-of-Hazards-needed does not always seem to be consistent.\nIn any case, the number of Hazards needed steadily increases for each raft.\nOnce you have reached and completed Wet Willie's, this sequence starts over,\nrequiring even more Hazards for each advance.  All the Hazards you need to\nadvance the Raft are lit at the same time - since there are only seven\nHazards, no more than seven are ever required to advance the Raft.  On normal\nsettings, the number of Hazards required is typically:\n\n1-2-2-3-3-4-4-5-5\n\nOnce you have completed Wet Willie's, you return to Raft #2, and more Hazards\n(typically an additional two) are needed to advance each Raft.\n\nAdvancing the Raft awards 1M\ntimes the Raft number you advance to.  Both\nreaching and starting Wet Willie's is considered to be Raft #20 for this\npurpose (there is no Raft #18, apparently).  The Raft number also determines\nthe base Jackpot value for Multiball.  The base Jackpot value is\n10M plus 1M\ntimes the Raft number (and for this purpose, reaching but not starting Wet\nWillie's is considered to be Raft #18,\ngiving you a base Jackpot value of 28M).\nFor every time you have completed Wet Willie's, the base Jackpot value\nis an additional 20M,.\nOn L-4 ROMs (possibly others), the maximum base value\nfor the Jackpot is 70M.\n\nReaching Wet Willie's awards\n20M for advancing from Raft #16.  However, you\ndon't actually start Wet Willie's until you have completed all of the lit\nHazards once more.  You know you've reached this stage when Wet Willie's\nis flashing but not running on the display\n(see Wet Willie's), or when you\nhear the quote \"Are we there yet?\"\nYou may also hear this quote when you\nstart Wet Willie's.  Actually starting Wet Willie's, unfortunately, doesn't\ngive any\nAdvance Raft points, although you would expect to receive 20M.\n(This once screwed me in a Pingolf tournament).\n\nHitting a lit Hazard is worth the current Hazard Value.  This is\n500K times\nthe current River Class, to a maximum of 3M.\nHitting an unlit Hazard is\ngenerally worth 50K\n(see Miscellaneous Scoring).\n\nYou can spot Hazards through Disaster Drops or relighting a lit Bounceback.\nDoing so behaves as if you had actually hit the Hazard, so that you can\ncollect the Man Overboard value in this fashion (but not Jackpots, Whirlpool\nAwards, or the Travelling Hazard in Wet Willie's).\n\nThe same set of Hazards is lit for each Raft for each player in a multi-\nplayer game.  That is, if Player 1 has to hit the Spine Chiller and No Way\nOut to advance to Raft #6, those same Hazards will be lit for Player 2 in\nthe same situation.\n\n\nBounceback\n\n\nThe Bounceback is notoriously misbehaved on most Whitewater machines.\nIt's\npossible for the ball to land and rest on the unfired kicker, and the Ball\nSearch will not fire the Bounceback as part of its search.  (However, the\nfourth Ball Search will kick any locked balls out of No Way Out.)\n\nYou can relight the Bounceback by hitting the three red plastic targets\nfacing left in the center of the playfield.  Completing these targets while\nthe Bounceback is already lit will spot a Hazard.\n\nThe Bounceback is automatically relit at the beginning of regular 3-ball\nMultiball, but not for other Multiball modes (if it's already lit, this\n\"relighting\" does not spot a Hazard).\n\nThere is an operator-settable option for the Bounceback to be automatically\nrelit at the beginning of each ball.  However, this does not make it easier\nto spot Hazards by hitting the Lite Bounceback targets.  If the Bounceback\nwas not lit at the end of your previous ball and you complete the Lite\nBounceback targets on the next ball, you will be awarded Lite Bounceback even\nthough the Bounceback is already lit.  Subsequent completions of the targets\nwill behave normally.\n\n\nWhirlpool Awards\n\n\nThere are six of these awards, and each is represented by a light on the\nplayfield in the Jet Bumper area.  The currently lit award is flashing.\nPreviously awarded items remain lit and unavailable until all awards have\nbeen completed.  The current award is collected by shooting Bigfoot Bluff\nwhen lit (that is, when the red light on the sign above it is lit).  Light\nBigfoot Bluff by shooting Insanity Falls when it is lit (that is, when the\nyellow light on the sign above it is lit).  When the Whirlpool is available\n(i.e., the yellow or red lights are lit and no Multiball or Whirlpool sequence\nis underway), every hit on the Jet Bumpers will change the currently lit\nWhirlpool Award (in sequence).  After collecting an award, the next available\nsequential award is lit.  After collecting all six awards, the Whirlpool is\nreset and Whirlpool Challenge is lit.\n\nNote that hitting Insanity Falls at any time,\neven if the Whirlpool is\nunavailable and the yellow light is unlit, will make the Whirlpool available\nonce the current sequence or Multiball has ended, as if you had hit Insanity\nFalls with the yellow light lit.\n\nIn order (from bottom to top), the awards are:\n\n Whirlpool Challenge (sequence)\n Man Overboard (sequence)\n Light Extra Ball\n Advance Raft\n Mystery Canyon\n 5X Playfield (sequence)\n\nLight Extra Ball is self-explanatory.  More than one Extra Ball can be lit\nat once (one hit on the Extra Ball target is required for each lit Extra\nBall).  All Extra Balls lit on the target are maintained from ball to ball\nuntil collected, except on Hard or Extra Hard settings, in which case all\nExtra Balls must be collected on the same ball they are lit.  You can\ncontinue with Whirlpool Awards before collecting the Extra Ball.\n\nLighting the Extra Ball by any method (Whirlpool Award, Mystery Canyon, or\nDisaster Drops) earns the quote \"Get the extra ball!\"\nfrom Wet Willie.  However, there is a very small chance that he will instead\nsay, \"Get the extra ball... YA WIENER!\"\nThis never fails to amuse me.\n\nAdvance Raft behaves as if you had collected all currently lit Hazards\n(without awarding the Hazard Value for them).  If Bigfoot Bluff is your last\nHazard to advance the Raft, and you collect the Advance Raft Whirlpool Award\nby shooting it, you will advance two Rafts at once.  Unlike the Mystery\nCanyon award of Advance 3 Rafts, the Whirlpool Advance Raft award\ndoes award the Raft value.\n\nDuring all of the Whirlpool Awards which have associated sequences, further\nWhirlpool Awards are unavailable until the sequence has ended.  However,\nHazards are lit and can be collected as usual.\n\nWhen the game begins, Whirlpool Challenge is the current award.  When you\ncomplete all six awards, Whirlpool Challenge is the current award on the\nnext set, regardless of which award you collected last.\n\nNote that whenever you shoot the lit Whirlpool and the ball is swirling into\nthe Whirlpool, all lights on the playfield cycle in an order corresponding\nto the six red lights, indicating the swirling of the Whirlpool.\n\n\nWhirlpool Challenge\n\n\nThis is a two-ball multiball.  The object of this mode is to \"fill the\nWhirlpool\" with balls.  Shoot the Whirlpool by shooting Bigfoot Bluff;\nBigfoot will divert the ball.  Initially, the Whirlpool is lit for\n5M; this increases by 2M\nfor every time you hit it.  The exceptions are every sixth\nhit, when you \"complete\" the Whirlpool\n(this is why there are six lights around\nthe exit from the Whirlpool).  Completing the Whirlpool is worth\n20M the\nfirst time, and an additional 20M\neach subsequent time (that is, 20M, 40M,\n60M, 80M, with a final limit of 100M).\nThe Whirlpool Completed value\nreplaces the currently indicated value, yet the value still increases as it\nwould have.  I believe the limit to the normal Whirlpool Value is\n53M or so (this value repeats).\n\nIf you lose one ball without collecting any Whirlpool values, the Whirlpool\nremains lit for quite a while for a Last Chance at 5M.\nThere is no grace\nperiod otherwise.  On easy settings, this Last Chance is offered regardless\nof the current Whirlpool value.\n\nIf you put the second ball into play and lose it before the locked ball kicks\nout of the Lost Mine, you will usually get it back, even though you scored\npoints by tripping a few sensors.  You can, in fact, get unlimited free\nR-I-V-E-R letters using this\ntrick - simply plunge the ball gently, let it\nroll over the lit right inlane and drain.  You'll always get the ball back.\n(This also applies to the Gold Rush and Multiball Restart.)  This is\nnot true with L-4 or newer ROMs, however;\nhitting any switch will immediately kick the other ball into play.\n\nStarting Whirlpool Challenge is actually dependent on the ball reaching the\nLost Mine sensor.  If the ball does not do so (usually because the switch in\nthe Whirlpool is flaky and closing when no ball is present), Whirlpool\nChallenge becomes solidly lit but does not start until the next time a ball\nis seen in the Lost Mine.  This means you can start more than one round at a\ntime under certain conditions!\n\n\nMan Overboard\n\n\n\n\"Head for the blinking lights!\"\n(or)\n\"Head for the blinking light!\"\n(if only one Hazard is currently lit)\n\nThis Whirlpool Award makes all currently lit Hazards worth\n20M, counting down to 3M.\nHitting any of these lit Hazards rescues the Man Overboard and awards\nthe current value.  There is a grace period at 3M.\nLetting this grace period\nexpire or side draining the ball at any point during the sequence earns the\nquote \"Dang, lost another one!\"\n\nThe 20M initial value is adjustable by the operator.\n\nNote that a side drain earns the quote but does not end the Man Overboard\nsequence.  If you manage a Death Save, the timer will resume and you can\nstill collect the Man Overboard value.  You can also hear the side drain\nquote twice in one ball.  Naughty, naughty.\n\n\nMystery Canyon\n\n\nThis is a random award, from the\n\"Spirit of the River\".  Possible awards are:\n\n 5M\n 6M\n 8M\n Extra Ball Lit\n Special\n Advance to River Class 6\n Advance 3 Rafts\n\nIf you have fewer than 3 Rafts remaining before reaching Wet Willie's, the\nlast award is downgraded appropriately.  In Tournament Mode, Mystery Canyon\nalways awards 5M.\n\nThe Spirit will not award River Class 6 if you are already at River Class 6.\nHowever, it may award River Class 6 if you have already reached it on a\nprevious ball - the Spirit is not concerned about your progress towards the\nVacation Bonus.\n\nThe Advance Rafts award does not award any of the Raft values.\n\nSee also \"Cows\".\n\n\n5X Playfield\n\n\n5X Playfield makes almost all playfield values worth five times as much for a\nperiod of twenty-five seconds.  There is a slight exception for Multiball\nJackpots.  On L-3 ROMs (possibly others),\nthis multiplier does not apply to the Vacation Bonus.\nCombo Shot awards are also not displayed as multiplied, although on\nL-4 ROMs (possibly others), the multiplied values are awarded.\nAll other values\nare multiplied by five during this time.  Most values which are multiplied are\ndisplayed as the multiplied value (with the exception of Boulder Bash).\nThere is no grace period on the 5X Playfield timer - in fact, it ends\nimmediately after it counts to 1 second, rather than to 0 seconds.  During\nWet Willie's and Bigfoot Hotfoot, the 5X timer is not displayed.  During\nMultiball (including the intro), it is rarely seen but remains active.\n\nHitting Bigfoot Bluff to award 5X Playfield will immediately multiply the\nCamera Craze or Hazard Value awarded for Bigfoot Bluff itself, but not the\nRaft value (if awarded).\n\nSee also \"Multiball\".\n\n\nSpine Chiller\n\n\nThe only special feature of the Spine Chiller is Multi-Millions.  Rolling\nthrough the Right Inlane lights Multi-Millions, which is\n2M, collected on the\nSpine Chiller.  Rolling through the Right Inlane immediately again after\ncollecting Multi-Millions will light Multi-Millions for\n3M.  This sequence\nreaches its maximum at 5M.\nA relatively slow shot which is nevertheless\nsuccessful will usually not award Multi-Millions, nor will it qualify as part\nof a Combo Shot.\n\nDuring Multiball modes, if there is ball being kicked out of No Way Out when\nyou hit the entrance sensor for the Spine Chiller, the game will logically\nconnect this with the other ball rolling over the Upper Playfield sensor, and\nwill award you the Spine Chiller if it is a lit Hazard.  This can be a useful\ntrick.\n\nNote that the Spine Chiller is the only way other than No Way Out (or the\nplunger, of course) to get a ball to the upper playfield.  It is the more\ndifficult of the two shots.\n\nIf you hit the Spine Chiller and let the ball go through the Right Inlane\nimmediately afterwards to light Multi-Millions, the first Multi-Millions will\nbe worth 3M, rather than 2M.\n\nSee also \"Combo Shots\".\n\n\nBoulder Garden\n\n\nThe current value of the Jet Bumpers is determined by the Boulder Garden\nHazard.  Initially, the Jet Bumpers are worth\n50K per hit.  For every time\nyou hit the Boulder Garden Hazard over the course of a game, this value\nincreases by 50K,\nto a maximum of 300K.  Every three times you hit the\nBoulder Garden Hazard, a Boulder Bash begins.  This is a twenty second\nsequence during which Jet Bumpers are worth 500K per hit.\nThe sound effects\nfor this run continuously, rather than in sync with actual Jet Bumper hits.\nPresumably, the Jet Bumpers award their regular value along with the Boulder\nBash value.  5X Playfield does apply to the Boulder value and the Boulder\nBash.  This once allowed me to obtain an\n83M Boulder Bash with little effort.\n\n\nDisaster Drop\n\n\nThe number of times you hit the Disaster Drop Hazard is counted, and certain\nawards occur at certain intervals.  The sequence is:\n\n Spot Hazard at 3\n Hold Bonus at 6\n Advance Raft at 9\n Spot Hazard at every 3 for a while thereafter\n\nExtra Ball Lit is somewhere between 3 and 15 - this is a\nself-adjusting value.  Unfortunately, the Status Report only indicates when\nthe Extra Ball will be lit, and hitting the Disaster Drop only indicates when\nthe next award comes.  As a result, there is often some uncertainty about\nwhat will next be awarded by the Disaster Drop.  There is a second Extra Ball\nLit at 60 Disaster Drops; this appears to be a fixed value.  On hard\nsettings, there is no second Extra Ball from Disaster Drop.\n\nWhen the Extra Ball Lit award falls on a multiple of 3, it appears that the\nregular award at that value is overridden.  This is most unfortunate.\n\nPast a certain number of Disaster Drops, the Spot Hazard award becomes less\nfrequent, eventually coming at multiples of 10 Drops, with the last Spot\nHazard being awarded at 100 Drops, with another promised at 255 Drops!\nIf you actually reach 255 Drops, the game stops counting,\nand every subsequent Drop spots a Hazard.\n\nNote that Hold Bonus does absolutely nothing on any\nWhitewater machine I\nhave seen or heard of.  The Bonus is computed from factors which are already\nmaintained from ball to ball, and the River Class is never held from one ball\nto the next, even with Hold Bonus.  Also, having Bonus Held on the last ball\nof a game does not award the bonus twice.\n\nSee also End-of-Ball Bonus.\n\n\nSecret Passage\n\n\n\n\"You found the Secret Passage!\"\n\nRolling over this switch immediately advances the Raft value.  A ball which\nwanders up into the Secret Passage and back down through it as well will\nadvance two Rafts.  This is true at all times, including Multiball.  If Wet\nWillie's is running, advancing the Raft by this method yields the appropriate\nsound effect and quote but has no other useful effect.\n\nThe Secret Passage will also collect the Man Overboard value when that\nsequence is running.  However, some people have told me otherwise.  This very\nlikely depends on your ROMs.\n\n\nCombo Shots\n\n\nThe Two Way Combo is Spine Chiller to Insanity Falls, worth 2M.\n\nThere are several possible Three Way Combos, each worth\n5M.  One is Spine\nChiller to Insanity Falls to No Way Out.  Another is Spine Chiller to\nInsanity Falls to Disaster Drop.  Spine Chiller to Insanity Falls to\nBoomerang Bend also qualifies.\n\nOn newer machines, there is a Four Way Combo for 8M.\nIt is Spine Chiller to\nInsanity Falls to No Way Out to Insanity Falls.  On older machines, the Four\nWay Combo awards 10M.\n\nOn newer machines, there is a Five Way Combo for\n10M.  It is the Four Way\nCombo followed by Disaster Drop or Boomerang Bend.  Note that all of these\nCombos are built upon simpler Combos, so the values add up to more than it\nseems.  The Five Way Combo is effectively worth at least 25M.\n\nNote that Combos can only be obtained by hitting the actual targets in the\nappropriate order, with little delays and no intervening targets (except the\nLeft Inlane switch and possibly the Lite Lock targets).  You cannot get\nCombos by spotting Hazards.  You also cannot get Combos during Multiball.\n\nAll Combos begin with the Spine Chiller.\n\n\nRiver Class\n\n\nThe River Class acts as a Bonus Multiplier and the multiplier for the Hazard\nValue.  You must also advance to a Class Six River in order to collect the\nVacation Bonus.  You can spot letters in\nR-I-V-E-R in two ways.  Hitting the\nplastic targets on the left side of the playfield will spot any unlit letter\nwhich is hit.  Rolling through any lit Inlane will also spot the first unlit\nletter in the word.  Completing R-I-V-E-R\nadvances the River Class.  There is\napparently no way to maintain your River Class from one ball to the next\n(Hold Bonus has no effect).  However, the R-I-V-E-R letters\nare maintained\nfrom one ball to the next, strangely enough.\n\nRemember, the light on the Inlanes and Outlanes is steerable with the\nflippers.  Either flipper moves the light to the right.  Flipping both\nflippers simultaneously moves the light twice (ie, there's no exclusion on\nthe flipping).  The Left Outlane is lit at the beginning of each ball.\nOutlanes are worth 250K when lit,\nand do not spot R-I-V-E-R letters.\n\nThe Hazard Value is 500K times the current River Class.\n\n\nWet Willie's\n\n\nOnce you have advanced the Raft while on Raft #16, you must complete all\nHazards one more time in order to reach Wet Willie's.  Effectively, you are\nadvancing from Raft #18 to Raft #20 - it isn't clear why there is no Raft\n#18 light on the playfield.  You can more easily reach Wet Willie's by using\none of the several shortcuts to advance the Raft to #20.\n\nWhen you reach Wet Willie's, he will appear on the display and call out,\n\"Welcome to Wet Willie's!\"\nYou will then be in Stage 1 of Wet Willie's.  At\nthis point, all Hazards are lit and worth 10M\nwhen collected.  Once you have\ncollected all seven Hazards, Stage 2 of Wet Willie's begins.  In Stage 2, a\nsingle Travelling Hazard is lit, moving from Hazard to Hazard.\nEach Hazard remains lit for\napproximately three seconds before the next Hazard becomes lit instead.  The\nsequence of lit Hazards repeats.  If you do not collect the lit Hazard within\n25 seconds, Wet Willie's ends and you are returned to Raft #2.\n\nCollecting the Travelling Hazard is worth a cool 100M (or\n50M on very early ROMs).  The Hazards are lit\nin the following order: Disaster Drop, No Way Out, Spine Chiller, Boulder\nGarden, Insanity Falls, Bigfoot Bluff, and Boomerang Bend.  25 seconds is not\nlong enough to go through this sequence twice - Stage 2 expires after the\nTravelling Hazard reaches No Way Out for the second time.\n\nStage 1 is maintained between balls - if you drain, your next ball will\nresume the sequence where you left off.  However, draining during Stage 2\nwill end Wet Willie's and return you to Raft #2.\n\nThere is no Stage 3.\n\nNote that if you lock a ball during Stage 2 of Wet Willie's, the hazard will\ncontinue to travel and the timer will continue to count down!  It is usually\nwise to avoid locking a ball during Stage 2.\n\nWet Willie's is considered a\n\"mode\" for some purposes - you cannot start\nthe Gold Rush or spot items, and you cannot collect Whirlpool Awards.\nHowever, you can light Locks and start Multiball; Wet Willie's and Multiball\nare not at all mutually exclusive.  You can start Multiball while in Wet\nWillie's (preferably Stage 1), and you can reach and start Wet Willie's while\nin Multiball.\n\nThere shouldn't be any grace periods on Stage 2 of Wet Willie's, but there is\none (perhaps unintentional) one.  If you shoot No Way Out while Disaster Drop\nis lit for 100M, the machine will pause.\nDuring that pause, the Hazard\ntravels to No Way Out and awards the 100M!\n\n\nBigfoot Hotfoot\n\n\nCompleting the two Hotfoot targets enough times (normally 3 or 4, but it may\nbe as high as 14 or as low as 2, depending on settings and reflexing) will\nstart a Bigfoot Hotfoot.  This sequence lasts 20 seconds and uses only the\nball currently in play.  During this time, Bigfoot is distracted and you can\nsneak into his cave.  Bigfoot Bluff awards the Bigfoot Jackpot, and Bigfoot\nwill not divert the ball into the Whirlpool.  Instead, the ball will quickly\nbe fed to the Right Inlane, from where you can shoot the ball to the upper\nplayfield for another Bigfoot Jackpot.\n\nThe Bigfoot Jackpot awards\n10M, and spots items for the Lost Mine.  If all\nthree items for the Lost Mine have already been collected (either via the\nLost Mine or Bigfoot Hotfoot), the next items are a Camera and a Cow.\nFurther Bigfoot Jackpots award only the 10M.\nCompleting a Gold Rush resets your items.\n\nThe sequence actually lasts for 20 seconds, but by the time the opening\nanimation has completed and you realise that Hotfoot is underway, there's\nusually only 16 seconds left on the timer.  The timer does pause for the\nkickout from No Way Out.  You can get six or seven Bigfoot Jackpots during a\nsingle Hotfoot if you're consistent and careful.\n\nBecause the Hotfoot timer pauses, the 5X Playfield timer will also pause\nalong with it if you have both running at once.  This makes it very easy to\nget 50M for each Bigfoot Jackpot.\nThis is probably a limitation of the software.\n\n\n\"Hey, a flashlight!\"\n\"Hey, a map!\"\n\"Hey, a key!\"\n\"Hey, a camera!\"\n\"Hey, a... COW?!\"\n\n\n\n\nCamera Craze\n\n\nOnce you have collected the Camera from the Bigfoot Hotfoot sequence, a\nCamera Craze is active.  For the rest of the ball, all Hazards except No Way\nOut are worth 3M\nand a quick Polaroid of Bigfoot in some goofy pose.  No Way\nOut is most likely excluded from this mode because it's too easy to shoot it\nrepeatedly.\n\nThere is a distinctive sound effect for Camera Craze.  You are awarded the\n3M Camera Craze even for Multiball Jackpot shots.  Note also\nthat the value becomes 15M during 5X Playfield.\n\n\nLost Mine\n\n\nHitting the ball into the Lost Mine, except during Multiball modes and\nWhirlpool Award sequences, spots items needed for the Gold Rush.  Once all\nthree items (flashlight, map, and key) have been collected, either via the\nLost Mine or the Bigfoot Hotfoot, hitting the Lost Mine (except during\nMultiball modes and Whirlpool Award sequences) starts the Gold Rush.  This\nis a two-ball multiball, during which all switches immediately award 250K.\nHazards can be collected as normally.  The Gold Rush ends when one or both\nballs drain.\n\nThe Gold Rush can be used to get free\nR-I-V-E-R letters using the same trick\nthat is described under Whirlpool Challenge (except on\nL-4 or newer ROMs).\n\nNote that hitting the Lost Mine to spot the third item will do so and also\nimmediately starts the Gold Rush, rather than requiring an additional hit.\nThis means that collecting the third item (the key) via the Bigfoot Hotfoot\nis pointless unless you also collect the Camera and/or Cow (of course, the\n10M or 50M is nice, too).\n\nDepending on reflexing, your game may begin with the Flashlight spotted.  If\nyou complete the Gold Rush, it will reset to the items you began with.  That\nis, if the machine spots the Flashlight at the beginning of the game, it will\nspot it towards the second Gold Rush as well.\n\nIt is possible, unfortunately, to start the Gold Rush while the game is\nTilted, if the ball happens to bounce up into the Lost Mine after you Tilt.\nPlease don't ask me how I found this out.  This essentially loses all of your\nitems.\n\n\n\"It's dark in here!\"\n\"Try this flashlight!\"\n\"Which way do we go?\"\n\"Here's a map!\"\n\"This door's locked!\"\n\"Try this key!\"\n\"It's a Gooooold Ruuuuush!!\"\n\n\nWorth noting: Wet Willie's dog barks sometimes during the Gold Rush.  The\nonly other time he contributes is when you press Start to add the fourth\nplayer to a game.\n\n\nMultiball\n\n\nYou must lock all three balls at No Way Out in order to start three-ball\nMultiball.  Under most difficulty settings, lighting the Locks the first\ntime in a game will only require hitting each green target (\"Lite\"\nand \"Lock\") once.  The second time will require hitting each\ntarget twice.  The\nthird and later locks require hitting each target only two times, but a\nflashing target will time out if you do not complete the other target within\na few seconds.\n\nSpecifically, the first locks go unlit to lit.  The second go unlit to\nflashing to lit.  The third go unlit to lit to flashing, but if only one is\nflashing, it will time out.  The meaning of a flashing light is unfortunately\ninconsistent for different Multiballs.\n\nLocking a third ball at No Way Out is the only way to start three-ball\nmultiball.  During Multiball, Insanity Falls is lit for the\nWhitewater Jackpot, which has a base value of\n10M plus 1M times the current\nRaft number.  More accurately, the base value is\n10M, increased by 2M for\nevery time you have advanced the Raft.  If you have completed Wet Willie's\nand advanced again to Raft #6, for example, your base value is\n36M.\n\nAll three balls are fed to the upper right flipper.  How many of these balls\nsuccessfully go through Insanity Falls determines whether you will be\ncollecting Single, Double, or Triple Jackpots for the rest of that Multiball.\nIf none or only one ball makes the Falls, you will be collecting regular\nWhitewater Jackpots.  If two make it, you will be collecting Double Jackpots.\nIf all three make it, you will be collecting Triple Jackpots.  The first ball\nis a Single Jackpot, the second a Double, and the third a Triple, and later\nballs do not increase the multiplier.\n\nOn most Whitewater machines (depending on ROM revision and difficulty\nsettings), there are exceptions for Multiball during 5X Playfield.  On some\nmachines, 5X simply does not apply to Jackpots, but 5X runs normally\notherwise.  On new, \"normal\" machines\n(L-3 ROMs), all Jackpots scored during\nthe 5X Playfield timer are 5X but not\nDouble or Triple.  There is only\nenough time to get four or five 5X Jackpots, because the timer runs even\nduring the Multiball animation, effectively draining 9-10 seconds from the\ntimer.  After 5X ends, Jackpots return to the Single, Double, or Triple\nvalue, depending on how many were scored initially.  On some older machines,\n5X does not make any such exceptions, and Jackpots can be collected at 5X,\n10X, and 15X the base value.  This is an abomination and should be\nstrenuously protested.\n\nThere are booming sound effects after each collected Jackpot - one boom for\nregular Whitewater Jackpots, two booms for Double Jackpots, three booms for\nTriple Jackpots, and five booms for 5X Jackpots.  These are the same sounds\nused in The Addams Family.\n\nThe 5X Jackpot is accompanied by a fantastic ululating scream from Wet\nWillie, which is also used at the end of the Vacation Bonus.\n\nHazards remain lit during Multiball, and you can advance the Raft in the\nusual fashion.  Doing so will increase your Jackpot value appropriately.\n\nThe Bounceback is automatically relit at the beginning of regular Multiball,\nunless it was flashing to time out when you lock the third ball.  There is\na bug in that case - the Bounceback does not get relit, yet the game thinks\nit's lit, yet it will not kick balls back.  Specifically, for the rest of\nthat ball, completing the red targets to relight the Bounceback will spot a\nHazard, as if the Bounceback were already lit.  The Bounceback will not\nfunction, and at the beginning of the next ball, the Bounceback\nis lit.\n\nWhen two of the three balls drain (or all of them, for that matter),\nMultiball ends as soon as the drained balls are detected.  Although the\nlight remains lit on Insanity Falls for a bit longer, there is actually not\nany useful grace period.  Cruel, isn't it?\n\nIf you do poorly in Multiball - specifically, if you do not score\nany\nJackpots and Multiball lasts only a short while (this appears to be a\nreflexing feature), No Way Out will be lit to restart the Multiball.  While\nthe Restart is lit (for 20 seconds), the Whirlpool Awards will still be\nunavailable.  Hitting No Way Out for the restart (no, you cannot spot No\nWay Out to collect the restart) will start a two-ball regular Multiball,\nduring which all Jackpots will be regular Jackpots - you cannot get\nDouble Jackpots by shooting both balls up Insanity Falls immediately.\n\nBy the way, I think the coolest music in Whitewater is when you hit No\nWay Out to restart Multiball and you have the second ball in the plunger lane.\nYou get to clearly hear the most frantic Multiball music.\n\n\nVacation Bonus\n\n\nThe Vacation Bonus, or Vacation Jackpot, is possibly the coolest award ever\nin pinball history.  In order to collect it, you must complete the Vacation\nPlanner, which is displayed on three occasions: in the Status Report, when\nyou hit the unlit Whirlpool, and when you hit No Way Out when any one of the\nfirst three sections of the Planner have been completed.  There are four\nsections to the Vacation Planner.\n\n(Note - older machines almost never display the Vacation Planner.  It is a\nbig secret in these machines.  I actually prefer it that way.  It was\ncertainly more amusing to discover it by accident.)\n\nThe first section is River Class.  You must reach River Class Six at some\npoint during the game, either through a Mystery Canyon award or by completing\nR-I-V-E-R five times on a single ball.\n\nThe second section is Wet Willie's.  You must start (but not necessarily\ncomplete) Wet Willie's at some point during the game.\n\nThe third section is the Boulder Garden.  You must collect all six Whirlpool\nAwards at some point during the game.\n\nThe fourth section is the Locks.  You must light all three Locks and lock all\nthree balls in order to collect the Vacation Bonus.  Contrary to my earlier\nstatements, locking the balls does not necessarily require the maximum\ndifficulty method of lighting the Locks.  Locks can be lit in the usual\nfashion - if you manage to reach the Vacation Bonus without ever starting\nMultiball, the Locks will be especially easy.  However, this is highly\nunlikely.  At best, you can hope to collect the Vacation Bonus with the\nsecond Multiball.\n\nOnce you have completed the first three sections of the planner, locked two\nballs, and have the third Lock lit, just lock the ball in No Way Out.  The\nmachine will go dead, pause, sound a fire alarm, and display several frames\nfrom many animations in the game, along with quick rap-style cuts from all\nthe quotes, ending with a display of the value awarded and the long yell from\nthe 5X Jackpot.  Next, the game quietly displays the current number of\ncredits, and increases it by one (that is, it awards Special along with the\nVacation Bonus).  Next, Multiball starts, and your base Jackpot value will\nbe at least 30M (because you have reached Wet Willie's).\n\nThe machine will also sometimes display the\n\"TESTING...\" power-on message\nbefore and/or after displaying the Credits value when awarding the Special\nat the end of the Vacation Bonus animation.\n\nNote that if you are at Wet Willie's or at River Class Six when you collect\nthe Vacation Bonus, those sections will be marked as complete on the Vacation\nPlanner for the next Vacation Bonus.  However, when Wet Willie's ends, it\nwill disappear from the next Vacation Planner, although River Class Six will\nnot.  This makes it possible to collect more than one Vacation Bonus on a\nsingle ball, which I have verified :)\n\nThe Vacation Bonus base value is\n200M.  It is increased by 10K at the end of\nevery game played.  The only time you can see the Vacation Bonus value is as\npart of the attract mode on newer machines.  On\nL-3 ROMs, it is not possible\nto apply the 5X Playfield to the Vacation Bonus - the game merely awards the\n200M+change value.\n\nNote: there seems to be some sort of unusual bug which very rarely sets the\nVacation Bonus value to exactly 799M.  I have actually collected\nthis value (sweet!), and have heard that it's been seen on at least one\nother machine as well.  It seems unlikely that exactly 59,900 consecutive\nnon-Vacation games had been played on two different machines...\n\n\nEnd-of-Ball Bonus\n\n\nThe bonus collected at the end of every ball is:\n\n[(50K * Lit Hazards Collected) +\n(75K * Rafts Advanced) +\n(100K * Whirlpool Awards Collected)] *\nRiver Class\n\nOne problem with this award is that the calculations the game displays are\nalmost always INCORRECT!\nVery often, you'll see something like:\n\n13 Hazards * 50K = 750K\n\nThe most reasonable explanation I have seen offered for this is that the\ncounts used in the computation are totals between all players, not just the\ncurrent player.  This does not, however, explain scoring errors in single-\nplayer games.\n\nThere are other problems in which parts of the Bonus Total are mysteriously\ndoubled, and the Bonus as reported in the Status Report often has nothing\nat all to do with reality.  It all gets even worse in multiplayer games.\n\n\nMiscellaneous Scoring\n\n\nLit outlanes are worth 250K.\nUnlit outlanes are worth 75K.\nMost other plastic targets are worth 50K\nor thereabouts.  Unlit Hazards are worth 50K (I\nthink).  Slingshots are worth 110\npoints, in order to affect the tens digit\nfor matching.  The entrance sensor to the Insanity Falls ramp is worth\n50K.\nThe entrance sensor to the Bigfoot Bluff ramp is worth\n5K.  The entrance\nsensor to the Spine Chiller is worth 5K.\nUnlit Inlanes are worth 50K.  Lit\nInlanes are worth 150K, or 500K\nif you complete R-I-V-E-R with that Inlane.\n\nSome of these are approximate, some are guesses.  A few may be correct.  Does\nit really matter?\n\n\nCows\n\n\nThere are three occurrences of Cows in Whitewater.  The first is the fifth\nitem found in Bigfoot's Cave during Bigfoot Hotfoot.  Once you have collected\nthat Cow, collecting the Mystery Canyon as a Whirlpool Award the next time\nduring that game will replace the usual Whirlpool animation with a picture of\nthe Spirit pulling a string on the legless Cow, which\n\"MOO\"s rather loudly.\nThe picture is labeled \"The Secret of the Cow\".\nThis picture also appears\nbriefly in the Vacation Bonus award.\n\nThe Secret of the Cow is not worth any special points, despite my earlier\nclaim that it was worth 10M.\n\nThe third cow in Whitewater is the famous Dueling Cows display, which can be\nobtained during attract mode.  Make sure there are no credits on the machine.\nIt may be necessary to power-cycle first on some machines.  Then, press the\nflipper buttons and start button in the following sequence:\n\n\n3L 1S 15R 1S 23L 1S\n\n\nThat spells COW.  Try it.\n\n\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\n\n\nIt's commonly said that all one has to do to get high scores on Whitewater is\nshoot whatever is lit or flashing at the time.  Although this is true to a\ncertain extent, some planning and strategy will invariably yield more\nconsistent and higher scores.\n\nNote that the Jackpot Value in Multiball is based on your current Raft\nnumber, and that later Multiballs are harder to start (because Locks become\nmore difficult to light).  Therefore, you should probably avoid Multiball for\na while, and concentrate instead on Whirlpool Awards and collecting lit\nHazards.  Since Whirlpool Challenge is the first Whirlpool Award, you should\nstart there.\n\nThere are two strategies for maximum points in Whirlpool Challenge, and they\nare dependent on proper behavior of the Lost Mine kickout.  You should be\nable to either dead-catch the ball on the right flipper, or hold the right\nflipper up and let the ball roll up into the Right Inlane (in which case you\nshould adjust the lit lane accordingly in order to collect one or two free\nR-I-V-E-R\nletters).  One strategy is to keep both balls in play, constantly\nhitting No Way Out and then the Whirlpool, paying attention to the sound\neffects in order to know where the next ball will be coming.  The sound\neffect for a ball being fed from No Way Out to the Upper Playfield is a\nshrill sound taken directly from Comet.  The other strategy requires catching\none ball on the left flipper at some point.  You can then hold that ball\nwhile repeatedly hitting No Way Out and the Whirlpool, then catching the ball\nfrom the Lost Mine and repeating the sequence until you slip up.  I have seen\nas much as 880M\ncollected from the Whirlpool Challenge alone.  (Note: there\nare also strobe lights which go along with the sound warnings.)\n\nIt may help to nudge the machine forward as the ball is being kicked out of\nthe Lost Mine in order to make it land fairly.  If the kickout is irregular\nor too powerful, advise your operator (good luck).\n\nIt is somewhat dangerous to shoot the Lost Mine for Gold Rush or the Hotfoot\ntargets for Bigfoot Hotfoot, but with enough play time, you will eventually\nstart these sequences more or less by accident.  Hotfoot is especially nice\nduring 5X Playfield, so keep an eye on how close you are to getting it.\n\nThe Extra Ball target is extremely difficult to hit, and dangerous besides.\nOne degree of insurance when going for this target is to start any Multiball\n(regular, Whirlpool Challenge, or Gold Rush) and risk draining one ball by\nshooting for it.  The hardest part is regaining control of the ball after\nshooting this target.\n\nThere are at least seven strategies for actually attempting to hit the Extra\nBall target (as opposed to hoping the ball will wander up there):\n\n You can\nstraight shoot it from the left flipper.\n You can backhand it from the right\nflipper as the ball is kicked out from the Lost Mine (I don't like this\ntechnique; it's fast and dangerous).\n You can hold the right flipper up as\nthe ball is fed from the Upper Playfield to the Right Inlane, letting it roll\nover to the tip of the left flipper, where it may (should) be in the perfect\nposition for straight shooting the target.\n You can nudge the machine forward\nas the ball is bouncing at the top of the right slingshot; this can often\npush the ball right up into the Extra Ball target.\n You can nudge the machine\nas the ball is hit by the left slingshot, which may kick the ball across to\nthe target.\n You can catch the ball on the right flipper, twitch the flipper\nso that the ball rolls up the inlane slightly and then down to the middle of\nthe flipper, from where you can neatly backhand the target (this is my\nfavorite method right now; it looks really cool).\n You can also shoot the\nball from the very tip of the left flipper, up the Right Inlane and into the\nExtra Ball target.  This is tricky and rarely works, but it sure does look\ncool.\n\nAt the beginning of Multiball, ignore balls that have already successfully\ncome down Insanity Falls.  Concentrate on getting the second and third balls\nup Insanity Falls to earn Double and Triple Jackpots.  You'll be very sorry\nif you settle for regular Jackpots, and end up hitting thirty of them during\nthat Multiball.  You will almost certainly lose the first ball if you\nconcentrate on getting the Triple Jackpot.  It may help to hold the left\nflipper up - the lower right flipper will be active because you're shooting\nInsanity Falls, and this may knock the first two balls up into play.  The\nnumber of balls currently in play (two or three) does not affect your Jackpot\nvalue in any way.\n\nIf you miss the first or second shot at Insanity Falls, let that ball go.\nYou have almost no chance of getting it up Insanity Falls, and it will be in\nthe way of the second and/or third balls coming from No Way Out.  Also, if\nyou let the first ball go and shoot it immediately into No Way Out, the game\nmay decide that one of its No Way Out kickouts failed, and you will get a\nfourth attempt at increasing the Jackpot Value.  This also means that if No\nWay Out is a lit Hazard and you hit it from below when the game is kicking a\nball out above, it may decide that it was merely a failed kickout, and you\nwill not be awarded that Hazard.\n\nHitting Insanity Falls or Bigfoot Bluff is best done with a solid slap on the\nflipper.  Without that extra bit of force, the sweet spot, especially for\nInsanity Falls, is extremely narrow.  If you get warnings from shooting\nInsanity Falls (assuming you aren't actually moving the machine), your\nmachine is set too sensitively.  Complain.\n\nKeep an eye on how many Disaster Drops you have collected.  There is an Extra\nBall between 3 and 15, and it's also useful for spotting the more difficult\nHazards such as the Spine Chiller and Boomerang Bend, and for advancing one\nof the last (difficult) Rafts.\n\nNote that Man Overboard applies to the Hazards which are already lit.\nTherefore, it's best to collect this when relatively easy Hazards are lit.\nYou can also spot a Hazard and this will award the Man Overboard value.\n\nBeware that a solid shot at No Way Out, particularly backhanded from the left\nflipper, may rattle around and slowly drift back out.  Wait for the sound\neffects or graphics before you back off from the machine after locking a\nball.  If the ball does rattle around and drop back down, it should come to\nthe tip of the left flipper.  A careful shot will put it gently back into No\nWay Out as originally intended.\n\nBeware that a very fast shot at Disaster Drop may jam against the Hazard\nsensor and come back around the loop, usually right towards the center drain.\nThis baffles me, but it does happen occasionally.  It usually helps to shake\nthe machine a bit from side to side if you know the ball is coming back down\nDisaster Drop, so you can avoid the center drain.  A small side to side or\nforward nudge also helps as the ball comes out of Disaster Drop after\ncompleting it successfully - this helps keep the ball off of the left\nslingshot, so you can maintain control and shoot Disaster Drop again if you\nwish.\n\nYou can also shoot Disaster Drop from either flipper.  A careful shot from\nthe right flipper has the added advantage that the ball may brush one or more\nof the Lite Bounceback targets.\n\nThere are certain situations where the game will kick out a locked ball from\nNo Way Out even though there is a ball available for the plunger lane.\nSpecifically, if you lock a ball and there is already one more locked from\nanother player than you have locked, it will kick out a locked ball in order\nto bring your Locks in line with the other players' Locks.  For Whirlpool\nChallenge, you will always receive the ball at the plunger lane if one is\navailable.  Otherwise, the Lost Mine kickout usually fires first, before the\nNo Way Out kickout (rather unfair).\n\nI've never purposely shot for the Boulder Bash.  It tends to happen a few\ntimes over the course of the game.  It can be nice during 5X Playfield.\n\nNote that, depending on your difficulty settings and the skill of the average\nplayer on your machine, the Bigfoot's Cave sensor, which is only reachable\nduring Bigfoot Hotfoot, may often remain untriggered for 90 balls, which\ncauses the machine to assume that the sensor may be faulty.  This is the most\ncommon cause of a \".\"\nbeing displayed after \"CREDITS\" or\n\"FREE PLAY\" on\nWhitewater machines, and it can obscure anything else that might be wrong\nwith the machine.\n\nIf the Bigfoot's Cave sensor has been judged out-of-order by the machine, the\nrules are adjusted, and you are awarded a Bigfoot Jackpot for shooting\nBigfoot Bluff during Hotfoot, before the ball reaches the Bigfoot's Cave\nsensor.  This means that if the sensor is in fact working, you will receive\ncredit for two Bigfoot Jackpots the first time you hit it.  The game will\nthen re-adjust its rules to normal.\n\nThe most important shot in the game is No Way Out.  You need to be able to\nhit this shot from either flipper at almost any time, and often you will\nbenefit from hitting it without even looking at the ball (ie, during\nMultiball when you're concentrating on shooting Jackpots on the Upper\nPlayfield).  The next most important shot would be Insanity Falls.  The\nBigfoot Bluff shot is actually rather easy.\n\nNote that the value of the Vacation Bonus is easily overshadowed by the\nDouble and Triple Jackpots in the ensuing Multiball, which will be at least\n60M and 90M, respectively.\nBut you definitely shouldn't pass up the Vacation\nBonus - it's too cool to be missed.\n\n5X Playfield may actually be somewhat wasted on Multiball under the correct\nscoring rules.  It's especially nice to have 5X Playfield during Wet\nWillie's.  Otherwise, try to collect it when you have only one Hazard\nremaining to advance to a high Raft number.  This can be worth as much as\n100M (for reaching, but not for starting, Wet Willie's).\n\nIf you want to attempt to get a 5X Vacation Bonus, you must reach and\ncomplete Wet Willie's, the entire Boulder Garden, and reach River Class\nSix.  Your best chance comes when you have Bigfoot Bluff lit for the 5X\nPlayfield Whirlpool Award, two balls locked, and the third Lock already lit\nfor the Vacation Bonus.  At this point, you have two ways of getting the ball\nto the Upper Playfield to start 5X Playfield.  One is to shoot the Spine\nChiller - this is a bit risky, since it is a difficult shot and in your\nattempt to regain control of a missed shot, you may accidentally collect the\nVacation Bonus by hitting No Way Out.  The other alternative is to let the\ncurrent ball drain!  On the next ball (assuming you have one ;), plunge the\nball to the Upper Playfield and collect 5X Playfield.  Catch the kickout from\nthe Lost Mine... and shoot for a 5X Vacation Bonus.  Note that this does NOT\naward 1B on L-3\nROMs, but on older ROMs, anything is possible.\n\nThere is an Insanity Record maintained, representing the person who hit\nInsanity Falls (lit or unlit) the most times over the course of a single\ngame.  It isn't worth anything remarkable except to have your initials there.\nThe only way to know how many \"Waterfalls\" you've collected is\nto hit the unlit Insanity Falls and see it as part of the graphics.\nWhen I say \"unlit\",\nI mean as a Hazard, not the yellow light.\n\n\nBugs\n\n\nMost of these have been provided by Dan Farris, farris@cig.mot.com, and\nsome of them have been noted elsewhere in the rulesheet.\n\nBonus and Hold Bonus are thoroughly messed up.\n\nSecond Whirlpool challenge on the same ball starts with balls\nalready whirling in the animation, and with whirlpool lights lit.\nShoot whirlpool, and these are corrected, showing one in both\nplaces.\n\nStart Multiball during Bounceback timeout. The bounceback light goes\nout and never relights. At this point, the three red standups will\nalways award a hazard instead of relighting the bounceback.\n\n5X combos don't display correct values, but seem to award 5X.\n\nWhat is the algorithm for determining which Lost Mine items are\n\"given\" when starting a game? Seems that installing new ROMs\nrandomly changes this. Perhaps memory is not initialized properly.\nFactory reset also seems to affect this.\n\nKickback memory adjustment is documented wrong. Kickback memory=YES,\nactually turns it on at the start of every ball. Kickback memory=NO,\nmeans remember the state from ball to ball. This adjustment would\nbe better called \"Kickback Relight\".\n\nWhen entering initials, after doing a backspace, the cursor moves\nback to the previous letter, as indicated by blinking that letter.\nPressing the flipper buttons changes the letter to either the\nbackspace or \"A\".\nIt should continue up or down the alphabet from where it initially\nwas. Same thing applies when entering Insanity Record. Default is\ntypically the same initials as already entered on high score list,\nbut when moving, the cursor goes back to \"A\".\n\nSound & Music test doesn't play raft 1 music, plays plunger music.\nTake Picture sound effect is also incorrect. (Plays bounceback sound)\n\nTilt during Bigfoot Hotfoot doesn't stop the bigfoot head from\ncontinually rotating. It also leaves \"HOTFOOT IN 0\"\nin the status\ndisplay and causes \"HOTFOOT IN 255\"\nwhen both hotfoot targets are\nagain hit. This causes an interesting strategy. If bigfoot hotfoot\nis running, the player could tilt, then easily restart hotfoot on\nthe next ball. It might be worth it if 5X were available at the\nboulder garden.\n\nTilt during last ball stops the waterfall lights and they do not start\nup again for the attract mode.\n\nHitting Disaster Drop to start Wet Willie's also awards the first\nshot toward completing Wet Willie's. None of the other shots do that.\n\nLetting the \"Enter Initials\" mode time out when achieving the high\nscore table causes the high score table to reset to the default\nvalues! Doing this during a 4 player game can allow other players\nto also get credits awarded, if their scores were high enough to\nbeat the default values.\n\nAfter entering initials after achieving a high score, the display\nshows \"Grand Champion\",\neven though this was not the highest score\never achieved.  It should show \"Best Rafter\"\nor \"River Master\" in order to be\nconsistent with the terminology used in the game.\n\nWhen setting replay or extra ball thresholds, the maximum value is\nonly 500M. This is too low.\n\nDan also once described a situation in which he shot the Advance Raft\nWhirlpool Award to start Wet Willie's, but Bigfoot failed to divert the\nball.  He drained, and at the start of the next ball, the Rafts were all\nreset and he hadn't received credit for Wet Willie's.  No Vacation Jackpot\nthat time...\n\n\nBragging\n\n\nMy own Insanity Record is 31.  My own River Master score is\n2,323,313,000.\nWithout Tilt, my records are 58 and\n4802M, with 163 lit Hazards collected.\n\nThanks to everyone who has sent notes and information which has contributed\nto this Guide.\n\nAnd don't forget to visit the Pinball Archive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Whitewater", "possible_shots": "Flippers, Plunger, Upper Playfield, Bigfoot, Bigfoot Bluff, Whirlpool, Bigfoot's Cave, Insanity Falls, Disaster Drop, No Way Out, Spine Chiller, Boulder Garden, Boomerang Bend, Secret Passage, Jet Bumpers, Extra Ball, Hotfoot, Light Bounceback, Lite Lock, R-I-V-E-R, Lost Mine, River Class, Raft Number, Bounceback, Outlanes and Inlanes, Slingshots", "manufacturer": "Williams/Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/whitewater.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: Whitewater", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

Makes it MUCH\n>more difficult to ever get the vacation bonus.\n\nBut that's part of the challenge.  However, because you can spot RIVER letters\nby lighting the inlanes (selectable with the flipper) it makes it a lot\neasier.  Just make sure that whenever a ball comes down to one of the\ninlanes from the upper playfield, that you set the appropriate inlane to be\nlit.  Also, when a ball kicks out from the Lost Mine (and it is not too\nstrong) you can hold up the right flipper, and the ball will roll up and\ndown the inlane, to give you 2 more letters.  Do this during a Whirlpool\nchallenge, and you can get to River Class 6 in no time.\n\n>The Lost Mine kickout is too strong on the machine I play.\n\nIf it is too strong, then try one of the following.   The one that works\nbest will depend on the peculiarities of your machine:\n\n    - don't hold the right flipper up.  Let the ball bounce off the right\n\tflipper to the left flipper.\n    - Dead trap the ball.  That is, hold the right flipper up.  Release\n\tthe flipper just as the ball hits the flipper after kicking out\n\tfrom the lost mine.  The ball won't roll up the inlane, so you\n\twon't get any RIVER letters, but at least it won't roll up\n\tthe inlane and down the outlane if the kickout is too strong!\n\n>It would be nice if the status report told you how many disaster drops were\n>required for the various awards, not just extra ball.  This applies to all the\n>new \"varying award for multiple loops\" games.\n\nIt doesn't have to.  The only award that is varying on the drops is the Extra\nBall (which I've seen anywhere from the 4th to 10th drop), which the status\nreport does show you.  Other than that, you get the following awards:\n\n    3-drops:\tSpot Hazard\n    6-drops:\tBonus Hold (i.e. nothing ... anybody see a working bonus hold?)\n    9-drops:\tAdvance Raft\n    12-drops:\tSpot Hazard\n    Every 3rd drop afterwards (i.e. 15, 18, 21, 24, etc): Spot Hazard\n    60-drops:\tLight Extra Ball\n\t(don't know if anything fancy happens at 99 drops).\n\n>Now it may be just because the Creature I play has the tilt set WAY too\n>sensitive, but I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.

I don't think I will ever get the\n>vacation bonus, although I'll keep trying!\n\nDon't be so pessimistic.  Concentrate on not losing the ball.  If you do\nthat, and you aim for lit targets, you'll eventually get those awards.\nAs for achieving Wet Willies, just remember the extra ways of advancing\nrafts and spotting hazards, other than hitting the lit target:\n\n    - You can spot a Raft with the Whirlpool Advance Raft award.  If possible,\n\tshoot this award only when either you have difficult hazards to get\n\t(e.g. boomerang bend) or you have lots of hazards left.  If you\n\tshoot the whirlpool when only the bigfoot bluff hazard is lit, then\n\tyou complete that raft, and advance the next raft too.\n    - You can spot a raft with your 9th drop.  Don't shoot that 9th drop\n\tif you have an easy hazard to get.  Again, wait till you have\n\ta difficult or lots of hazards to get.\n    - You can spot a hazard on every 3rd drop (except for 6th drop).\n    - You can spot a hazard everytime you complete the 3 red targets,\n\tand your bounce-back is already lit.  I tend to hit these targets\n\toften during an un-controlled multiball :-).  When I notice only\n\tone target left to hit, it is often easier to hit that then to\n\taim for something like boomerang bend, where if you miss you risk\n\tdraining.\n    - You spot a raft in the secret passage; although this one is more\n\tluck than it is skill, I noticed that if you back hand a moving ball\n\tfrom the left flipper into the boulder garden, it won't have\n\tenough ooomph on it to go all the way to the boulders, and often\n\tswings down through the secret passage.\n\nI've also found that mastering the spine chiller can be very valuable\nduring the game.  It is not an easy shot, but if you practice it a lot,\nyou'll be able to hit it quite often, and makes a difficult hazard into\na fairly easy one.  This is also the preferred way to go to the upper\nplayfield when you have 5x playfield, as that 'millions' ramp now\nawards you 10M,15M,..., which is much better than the measly points you\nget by going to the upper playfield via no-way-out.\n\nI know that Whitewater is not as \"cool\" looking as Creature; however, I really\nlike it because to do well does not only involve skill, but also lots of\nstrategy (I don't agree that the 'shoot whatever is lit' is the best\nstrategy!).  There are times when it is desirable to postpone certain shots\n(e.g.  don't get the 9th drop if the only hazard you have lit is no-way-out)\nuntil that same shot can be more valuable later.  By properly planning which\nshots you do when, you can maximize the speed at which you hit Wet Willies and\nthe Vacation Bonus.  Another example, you don't want to start man overboard\nwhen you have a difficult hazard lit.  It is much better to start it when you\nhave an easy hazard, or lots of hazards lit.  Same goes for the ideal time of\ngetting the 5x playfield.  For example, keep an eye on how many hot-foots you\nhave left before starting the bigfoot jackpot.  If you start 5x playfield, and\nyou only have one hotfoot left, then hit it, and go for the bigfoot jackpots:\n50Mil a shot.  Of course, there are lots of other shots that make 5x\nworthwhile, but a bad time to get 5x is if you are not close to Multiball,\nhave lots of hazards lit, but river class is only at I or II, and you\nare nowhere near starting the hotfoot.\n\nI don't think Creature has any such strategy.  To get high scores, you\ndo the following:  go for the F-I-L-M letters; start Multiball; shoot\nleft ramp 4 times with one ball; search for creature with other ball;\nthen go for jackpot and Super J.  I agree that the shots involved require\na lot of skill, but there is very little in the way of strategy and\nplanning as you go.\n\n~dave\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "Whitewater", "possible_shots": "Light Extra Ball, Spot Hazard, Bonus Hold, Advance Raft, Whirlpool Advance Raft, secret passage, spine chiller, 5x playfield, bigfoot jackpots", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/whitewater-notes.txt"}, "type": "Document"}

starts at the bottom middle and proceeds clockwise\n      around the game.\n      \n\nFlippers\n        Two flippers in the usual location and of normal size.\n        \nLeft Outlane\n        Can be lit for Slots.\u00a0 No kickback, but one can be simulated (see\n        \"Psuedo Kickback\" in Rules section).\n        \nLeft Inlane\n        Can be lit for Start Taxi Chase.\n        \nLeft Slingshot\n        The normal variety.\n        \nSuper Skill Shot / Lock Entry\n        A saucer located directly above the left inlane which acts as a  Super Skill Shot, and \"Lucky Lock\" (Lucky b/c one can't\n        purposefully shoot here other than from the plunger or via the Exit of\n        the elevator).\u00a0 The entrance to the \"Lucky Lock\" is from the right and\n        above the Mystery Target but below the I of the T-A-X-I Targets.\n        \nMystery Target\n        A target directly above the top of the left slingshot which can be\n        lit to award various awards or jackpots.\n        \nT-A-X-I Targets\n        Hits to these spot the appropriate letter.\u00a0 These are also used for\n        the skill shot.\u00a0 The letters can be spotted, see Taxi Chase.\n        \nLeft Orbit (aka Left Taxi Chase)\n        Leads to the Pop Bumpers or past them and out the Right Orbit\n        entrance.\u00a0 If the orbit is lit for Taxi Chase it will go past the bumpers.\n        If not, \"Nudge Slots\" will be lit in which case a post will interrupt\n        the balls travel such that it falls into the bumpers (just like the post\n        on ToM behind the Magician's Trunk).\n        \nRed Standup Target\n        A hit to this causes the next roulette bet to be Red provided the\n        Black Standup Target is not hit.\n        \nPhone\n        A hole under a black plastic phone.\u00a0 This hole is at the end of a\n        lane directly to the right of the Left Orbit entrance.\n        \nElevator Rising / Lowering Target Bank\n        A set of 3 targets which can lower into the playfield floor.\u00a0 When\n        lowered one has full access to the Elevator.\u00a0 When raised it is possible\n        to access the Elevator, but only by a very narrow margin.\n        \nElevator (Ramp)\n        A large, wide, unique ramp which leads to 3 different habitrails.\n        From left to right these habitrails are UP, EXIT, and DOWN.\n        \nJet Bumper Hole\n        A hole directly behind the Elevator which the ball will usually fall\n        into after being in the Bumpers.\n        \nPop Bumpers\n        3 of them located in the top middle of the playfield in the standard\n        triangular configuration.\n        \nRight Ramp (aka Train Loop), Right Orbit (aka Right Taxi Chase)\n        Either one or the other...\u00a0 It is the Right Ramp if Taxi Chase hasn't\n        been started (in which case the ramp is down), or it is the beginning of\n        the Right Orbit, if Taxi Chase has started (in which case the ramp will\n        be up).\u00a0 The ramps up / down action is similar to that in Whirlwind.\u00a0 The\n        ramp leads to the left flipper (or the Bumpers if it's a weak shot), the\n        orbit leads around past the bumpers and out the left orbit entrance.\n        \nBlack Standup Target\n        A hit to this causes the next roulette bet to be Black provided the\n        Red Standup Target is not hit.\n        \nRoulette (VUK / Lane)\n        A VUK at the end of a lane.\u00a0 The entrance to this lane is directly to\n        the right of the Right Ramp/Orbit entrance.\n        \nSpinner\n        Located in the Roulette Lane.\u00a0 The spinning affects the amount\n        that my be bet on the roulette game.\n        \nSewer (Hole)\n        A hole directly to the right from the Roulette entrance.\n        \nPenthouse Key Targets\n        A set of two targets directly below the Sewer.\n        \nPlunger Lane Exit\n        Immediately below the Penthouse Key Targets.\u00a0 One way only.\n        \nPlunger Lane\n        A short lane which causes the ball to shoot across the playfield.\u00a0\n        Note: there is a normal plunger for the player to use; however, the\n        machine can also autoplunge balls.\n        \nRight Outlane\n        can be lit for Slots (See \"Psuedo Kickback\")\n        \nRight Inlane\n        can be lit for Start Taxi Chase\n        \nLeft Slingshot\n        the normal triangular shape.\nJackpot Shots:\nDuring Multiball the Sewer Hole and Roulette VUK are the jackpot shots\n      (as shown on the playfield).\u00a0 Note: The mystery target also awards\n      jackpots if lit.\u00a0 Furthermore, going up, down, and exiting on the elevator will\n      award a jackpot (each habitrail stops the slots on jackpot).\n      The Cabinet\nVery slick.\u00a0 It is very noirish and has a old time murder mystery feel\n      to it (think 1930's Sam Spade... etc).\n\n    Story Background:\nCharacters:\n\nNick Spade - Private eye\n        Tony - Owner of the casino and very content.\u00a0 Age 38\n        Victoria - Spider Lady from Europe.\u00a0 Age 34\n        Butler - Victoria's manservant.\u00a0 Also Walter, Tony's first partner.\u00a0 Age 53\n        Bruno - Tony's bouncer / bodyguard.\u00a0 Formerly Tex, Victoria's third husband.\u00a0 Age 42\n        Trixie - Works as a dealer for Tony.\u00a0 Also Walter's (unknown) daughter from England.\u00a0 Age 23\n\n\n1900\n    Walter, a young wealthy playboy, and Mia, wife of the English Ambassador\n    have a fling.\u00a0 They conceive VICTORIA, a secret VICTORIA'S mother keeps.\u00a0 She\n    doesn't tell him before she leaves never to see him again.\n\n1911\n    TRIXIE's mom dies giving birth to her.\u00a0 Tex is forced to be a single parent.\n\n1915\n    Walter comes to town, meets TONY, and they become partners.\u00a0 They start the\n    W&T PALACE, a struggling casino.\u00a0 TONY then cheats Walter out of his half of\n    the casino and Walter disappears.\n\n1917\n    Walter returns to Europe to find that VICTORIA'S mother has died and that\n    VICTORIA has grown up in a boarding school.\u00a0 VICTORIA looks amazingly like\n    her mother.\u00a0 Walter can only think of how much he loved Mia when he sees\n    VICTORIA.\u00a0 Walter changes his name to BUTLER.\u00a0 He tells VICTORIA that he used\n    to work for her mom and she hires him as her manservant.\u00a0 BUTLER, trapped by\n    the memory of Mia, does whatever VICTORIA says.\u00a0 VICTORIA treats BUTLER like\n    dirt....as she does most everyone.\n\n1919\n    Tex forms a partnership with TONY and they create the T&T PALACE.\u00a0 This\n    casino thrives and they become rich.\u00a0 TONY and Tex each get a tattoo on their\n    arm that reads T&T PALACE.\u00a0 TRIXIE is 8 and has a crush on TONY.\u00a0 TONY and Tex\n    are like brothers.\n\n1922 (MAY)\n    BUTLER suspects the fate of all his daughters' past husbands and encourages\n    VICTORIA to go after TONY.\u00a0 VICTORIA shows up with BUTLER.\u00a0 VICTORIA and TONY\n    have been lovers off and on for a couple of years.\u00a0 TONY still avoids her\n    grasp.\u00a0 VICTORIA marries Tex, her third husband.\u00a0 She becomes TRIXIE'S\n    stepmother.\u00a0 TONY doesn't recognize Walter because BUTLER is the shadow of\n    the man Walter was and looks 10 years older.\n\n1923 (JANUARY)\n    VICTORIA and TONY conspire to kill Tex.\u00a0 The plan was: VICTORIA gets the\n    money and TONY gets the Casino.\u00a0 Tex overhears VICTORIA'S half of the\n    conspiracy.\u00a0 When she hangs up the phone he roughs her up and threatens that\n    if anything happened to him she would be sorry.\u00a0 BUTLER witnessed Tex\n    roughing her up.\u00a0 Unknowingly to VICTORIA or TONY, BUTLER sabotages the\n    brakes of Tex's car.\u00a0 Tex drives off a cliff.\u00a0 Car explodes.\u00a0 Body was never\n    found.\n\n    Tex, injured and disfigured, makes it to an underground doctor / plastic\n    surgeon.\u00a0 Tex is reborn as BRUNO.\u00a0 BRUNO has one agenda; to get VICTORIA for\n    attempting to kill him.\u00a0 No one will get in his way.\n\n    TRIXIE, now 11, moves in with TONY.\u00a0 VICTORIA can not be tied down with a\n    child.\u00a0 TONY is the closest family that TRIXIE has.\u00a0 She resents VICTORIA for\n    this and still has a crush on TONY.\n\n    TONY and VICTORIA each believe that the other did the brake job on Tex.\u00a0 VICTORIA\n    and BUTLER leave for Europe in search of another husband for\n    VICTORIA.\n\n    T&T PALACE becomes TONY'S PALACE\n\n1930\n    TRIXIE and TONY are lovers but TONY will not commit.\u00a0 TONY gives her a job at\n    his Casino.\u00a0 He keeps her on a string, never letting her get enough money to\n    be free.\n\n1932\n    BRUNO goes on a fact-finding mission about VICTORIA.\u00a0 He learns all about her\n    and her dead husbands.\u00a0 He learns about her real life father.\u00a0 He also learns\n    about her relationship with TONY.\u00a0 He now suspects TONY and VICTORIA of\n    \"fixing\" his brakes.\n\n    TONY, unknowingly, hires BRUNO to work for him.\u00a0 BRUNO wants to be close\n    because he knows that sooner or later VICTORIA will show up, and he wants to\n    keep an eye on TRIXIE, his daughter.\u00a0 TRIXIE has been his only reason to live\n    on some dark lonely nights.\u00a0 BRUNO keeps a locker full of TRIXIE pictures and\n    news clippings.\n\n1934 (Yesterday)\n    BRUNO waits for the day that he can extract his revenge on VICTORIA and\n    TONY.\n\n    TONY thinks all is well and is ready to enjoy the good life that he\n    deserves.\n\n    TRIXIE has finally learned that TONY is not to be trusted and she must do\n    what it takes to protect herself.\n\n    VICTORIA and BUTLER show up to try and snag TONY once more!\nSkill Shot:\nPull the plunger and collect what is displayed on the DMD for the\n      letter you hit if that letter is lit.\u00a0 Else you just spot that TAXI letter.\n\n      The awards

  multiplier, and locks the ball.\u00a0 Once you have locked two balls and\n      hit it again it locks the third ball and gives you \"basement multiball\".\n\n      Rules:\nIn General, the objective is to solve the murder mystery by discovering\n      whodunnit and then to capture them.\u00a0 There are a total of five cases before\n      the cases cycle again.\n      To solve cases one must (usually) collect evidence, interrogate\n      suspects, choose / guess a killer, and (when that choice is correct)\n      catch the killer.\n      Note also, there are a few modes which are started either via exiting\n      the elevator on the appropriate floor or solving a case.\n      Floors / Modes:\nThere are 11 floors accessible via the Elevator.\u00a0 They are, and their\n

having accessed all\n            other floors or correctly guessed killer).\nInterrogating Suspects:\nThis is done by answering the phone (when lit / ringing).\u00a0 Upon answering,\n      one of the suspects will answer a question asked by you (actually, the\n      game asks it).\u00a0 Note: the suspect will ALWAYS talk about\n      the killer unless he/she IS the killer.\n      WhoDunnit?:\nThis is lit at the phone and allows you to choose who you think is the\n      killer.\u00a0 If you choose the correct suspect Catch the Killer is initiated.\u00a0\n      It is lit by answering the phone.\n\n      Collecting Clues / Evidence / Equipment:\nClues can be collected by spelling T-A-X-I (either directly or via Taxi\n      Chase), the Super Skill Shot, and the Slots (3 fingerprints).\u00a0 Clues max\n      out a 50M, and five clues collected in one case will light an\n      extra ball.\u00a0 Collected clues reset when starting a new case.\u00a0\n      Collecting a clue lights the telephone.\u00a0 Clues are (in order):\u00a0 Bullet,\n      Broken Mirror, Dagger, Fingerprint, & Matchbook.\u00a0 They have no\n      specific significance to the case or killer.\n      Evidence can be collected via exiting on floors 3 and 5 and gives you 25M points.\n      Equipment can be collected by exiting on floor 6, the Slots\n      (3 magnifying glasses), the 2nd consecutive Train\n      Loop, and the Sewer.\n      \n\n\n\n\u00a0Revolver\u00a0\n\u00a0Helps you during multiball by increasing the value of the jackpot in the jets faster.\n\n\u00a0Magnifying

other award is given.\n\n\u00a0Map\u00a0\n\u00a0Helps you in the Sewer if no other award is given.\nTaxi Chase:\nThis is started by having the ball roll over a lit inlane.\u00a0 After this,\n      both orbits are lit for Taxi Chase.\u00a0 Each shot will extend the time of the\n      chase and award a T-A-X-I letter.\n\n      Nudge Slots:\nWhen Taxi Chase is not occurring a shot up the left orbit will be\n      forced into the Bumpers.\u00a0 Each bumper moves a different reel of the slot\n      machine.\u00a0 When two or more match they won't change.\u00a0 The slot machine award is\n      collected if the ball then falls into the hole directly beneath the\n      Bumpers.\n      During multiball each bumper hit raises the jackpot value.\u00a0 1M normally or 5M per hit if you have the Revolver.\n\n      Sewer:\nIf lit it does the slot machine.\n      If unlit and you have the Flashlight but NOT the Map you will find the Map.\n      If unlit and you have the Flashlight AND the Map it will award various rewards (increase multiplier, interrogate suspect\n         find evidence, lite whodunnit, or give you 50M).\n      If unlit but you don't have the Flashlight or Map you get 1M\u00a0 X\u00a0 the number of times you've entered the Sewer.\n      Note: The first time you enter the sewer with the Map you will get a voice saying something similar\n         to \"Hey Nick, what're you doing in the Sewer?\".\u00a0 Nick responds, \"I like it in the Sewer\".\u00a0 I believe this is the only\n         time the private eye (ie. you, the voiceover guy) is named.\n\n\n      Mystery Target\nHitting a Penthouse Key Target lights the Mystery Target.\u00a0 The Mystery Target\n         awards whatever should be awarded at the time.\u00a0 For example, if during Penthouse\n         Party, it awards the 3 Penthouse Party awards.\n\n      Train Combo\nMaking consecutive ramp shots scores a Train combo.\n         1st lights Roulette\n         2nd gives Flashlight\n         3rd lights Extra Ball\n         4th starts Loop Champion (Try to beat previous champion for \"big points\".)\n\n      Roulette:\nWhen lit, you are given the choice to bet or not.\u00a0 Regardless, the\n      multiplier will be increased.\u00a0 The amount of the bet is determined by the\n      spinner.\u00a0 Whether you'll win or lose seems random.\u00a0 However, it has been\n      noticed that in tournament mode it wins every other time (1,3,5,etc).\n      Note that, early on in the game you can bet MORE than you have.\u00a0 If you win, you win that amount.\u00a0 If you lose, you just go to zero.\n      Roulette is lit by shooting up the Roulette VUK when unlit, by\n      exiting on the Main Floor, and completing the 1st Train Combo.\n\n      Slots:\nThe slots act just like a slot machine.\u00a0 However, if 2 reels match when you are finished you are given a second chance.\n         To win the second chance you only need to complete a spin shot (Phone, Roulette, Sewer, and\n      Exit).\u00a0 Note: if you cause a slot event by losing the ball down a lit outlane and match two, the second chance feature becomes a \"Psuedo\n      Kickback\".\n      Possible awards are:\n

the award on the left or\n      right reel (unless they match).\u00a0 Else, the wild can replace anything\n      (obvious, eh?).\n      Note: The ?'s are located on reels with another award.\u00a0 On the left reel\n      it is with the Extra Ball, middle reel - Bar, and right reel -\n      Fingerprint.\n\n      \"Psuedo Kickback\":\nIf, on losing your ball via a lit outlane, the slot machine matches only 2\n      of 3 awards you will be given a Second Chance and an autolaunched ball.\n      Other awards from the slot that simulate a kickback are Multiball\n      and Elevator Madness for obvious reasons.\n\n      Cases:\nThere are a total of five cases which occur in the following order:  Missing Bullet,  Broken Mirror,  Bloody Dagger, Sticky Fingers, and\n      The Tattoo.\u00a0 There is no significance, in the game, to any of the cases.\n\n      Catch the Killer (aka The Roof):\nYou attempt to catch the killer.\u00a0 To do this,\n      you must complete the lit Taxi Chase followed by the Phone.\u00a0 Taking too\n      much time causes the lit Taxi Chase to change, or the Phone to unlight and\n      go back to a lit Taxi Chase.\u00a0 Once the phone is lit a 100M hurry up award\n      is started which stops at 25M.\u00a0 Catching the killer ends the case\n      (lighting it on the playfield) and starts a 4 ball multiball.\u00a0 During this multiball any lit shot that you hit\n      earns the value of the hurry up award when you caught the killer.\u00a0 During this multiball the 3-Bank Target will cycle up and\n      down intermittenly.\u00a0 At the end of multiball a new case is started.\n      Should you not catch the killer you still go on to the next case, but\n      you will have to resolve this case later.\n      This mode is accessed via the Roof or choosing the correct suspect from\n      WhoDunnit?.\n\n      Elevator Madness:\nA two ball multiball (with a x second ballsaver).\u00a0 The object is to hit\n      the Elevator.\u00a0 Either left or right shot reverses the direction of the\n      elevator, and collects value for that floor.\u00a0 Exiting on a floor also\n      collects point value for that floor.\u00a0 Points awarded range from ~10M to ~35M.\u00a0 After you've been\n      given awhile to score points (20 sec?) the 3-Bank Target begins to cycle up and down intermittently.\n\n      Penthouse Party:\nAll flashing shots score increasing values (10M, 20M, 30M, etc.) until the\n      timer runs out.\n\n      Basement Multiball:\n3 ball multiball that ends when less than 2 balls are in play.\u00a0 Jackpots\n      can be collected at the Roulette VUK and the Sewer along with the Mystery\n      Standup and making all 3 Elevator shots.\n      Jackpots are increased by Bumper hits, increasing 1M normally & 5M when you have the Revolver.\n\n      Wizard Mode / Award:\nThere isn't one :-(\nEnd of Ball Bonus:\nNumber of Cases Started\u00a0 X\u00a0 5M +\n      Number of Clues Collected\u00a0 X\u00a0 1M +\n      Number

initials if they've scored\n      the most during the Catch the Killer mode.\u00a0 These initials will be\n      displayed whenever the Slots start.\n      Loop Champion:\nBased upon number of Train Loops in a row...\n      Grand Champion / 1st - 4th (can be bought):\nTwo credits for GC, 1 for all others.\u00a0 There is no limit on\n      the number of buy-ins allowed.\n      The highest score I've heard of is ~120 Billion.\u00a0 The highest I've seen\n      is 27 Billion.\n\n      Strategy:\nThe Basement Multiball and Penthouse are very lucrative.\u00a0 In the Basement you can just keep getting Jackpot after Jackpot.\n      For the Penthouse it's like printing money.\u00a0 Just keep making shots at the elevator.\u00a0 Keep making the shots\n      consistently until the timer runs out (which is easy!) and it's worth ~750M.\n      Do not necessarily choose the correct killer.\u00a0 For instance, if you have a number of clues it might be better to work on getting more\n         clues (to light the extra ball) than to choose the right killer.\u00a0 Then you can start racking up more clues for the next extra ball.\n      Catch the killer!  The 4 ball multiball (with ball saver for a bit) can be very lucrative.\n      In a good, long game the end of ball bonus becomes important.\u00a0 So spin the slots, start & finish case, and get that multiplier up\n      there and you can get bonuses of 1B+.\n\n      Quotes:\nMy favorite is \"Player X is a real wizard!\" upon ...?\n      \"You'll do\" upon getting Grand Champion ;-)\n\n    Miscellaneous:\nTournament Mode:\n         Press and hold both flippers for about 5 seconds during attract mode, then follow the display.\nBugs:\nDoesn't display 10B+ when in play:\nIf you score more than 9,999,999 the display does not change the font so that you can see the \"1\" for 10 billion.\n      The default font for the score cannot display that digit.\u00a0 Once the game is over you will get the proper credit for scoring the 10 billion.\n      7th floor labeled wrong on DMD:\nWhen the ball exits on the 7th floor for Elevator Madness the DMD actually says 8th floor.\u00a0 I don't know if that's a bug\n         or part of the Elevator Madness, meaning the \"elevator\" is \"malfunctioning\".\n      Upon powering up the game it doesn't check for the 3-bank target being up:\nWhen a game ends and the 3-bank target is up and you turn the machine off you run into a problem the next time you turn the machine on.\n         It does all its initial checks but doesn't notice if the 3-bank target it up!  So when you go to play it's always up and it doesn't register\n         when you hit it!  Only way to \"fix it\" is to trigger a mode that would make the machine cycle the 3-bank target up.\n\n    Easter Eggs:\nMidnight Madness\nAt midnight, assuming the clock is set correctly, Midnight Madness will start.\u00a0 If someone is in the middle of a game,\n         it will happen during play.\u00a0 If a game is not active, it will occur at the first ball-start.\u00a0 At the beginning you will hear\n         \"I was afraid of this\".\u00a0 After a few seconds of gameplay, the flippers will go dead.\u00a0 The balls you have in play will\n         drain.\u00a0 The playfield goes dark.\u00a0 The game will shut-down.\u00a0 It will appear as if you tilted the game.\u00a0 But did\n         you?\u00a0 Nope!\u00a0 \"Midnight Madness\" will now flash on the screen.\u00a0 It will then empty every ball inside the machine\n         and start Midnight Madness (4 ball) multi-ball.\u00a0 Every hit is worth 3M and a \"BOOM\", \"BLAM\", \"DOH!\", etc. will\n         appear on the DMD with each score, ala the old Batman TV show.\n\n      3D Mode:\nStart a game and then press the following sequence:\n         B, 8L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 6L, 2R (where B is both flippers, L is left & R is right)\n         When it says \"Put on your 3D Glasses Now\" launch the ball.\n         (It has also been reported to work \"During Attract mode, with no credits\" but didn't work for me.\nEditor's Notes\n\n\nHTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\nBig rewrite/refresh/add by http://pinball.blueirony.com/ in July 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "WhoDunnit?", "possible_shots": "Flippers, Left Outlane, Left Inlane, Left Slingshot, Super Skill Shot / Lock Entry, Mystery Target, T-A-X-I Targets, Left Orbit (aka Left Taxi Chase), Red Standup Target, Phone, Elevator Rising / Lowering Target Bank, Elevator (Ramp), Jet Bumper Hole, Pop Bumpers, Right Ramp (aka Train Loop), Right Orbit (aka Right Taxi Chase), Black Standup Target, Roulette (VUK / Lane), Spinner, Sewer (Hole), Penthouse Key Targets, Plunger Lane Exit, Plunger Lane, Right Outlane, Right Inlane", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/whodunnit.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: WhoDunnit?", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: World Challenge Soccer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 World Challenge Soccer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon Norris' Tournament Mode Notes\n\n\nRules, hints and strategies for WORLD CHALLENGE SOCCER when in\ntournament mode:\n\nFor those of you familiar with the standard rules of this game,\nhere are the differences-\n\n\n The \"Challenge Match\"  L.E.D.s are reset to three lit at the\nbeginning of each ball.  This means that this feature is no\nlonger a carryover feature.  To get to World Championship, two\nnormal \"Challenge Matches\" must be won during that same ball.\nThe game does not remember any matches won for that players next\nball. (\"Challenge\" may still be lit, but the L.E.D.s will reset.)\n  The bottom three soccer ball lamps are automatically\n\"lined-up\" at the beginning of each ball. (Lighting SUPERSCORE)\nThis means that this feature is no longer random.  This does two\nthings, first it adds strategy of whether to take \"hit all\ntargets\" on the skill shot or to take \"adv. goal value\", so that\na shot at the center target is possible.  Secondly, it makes\n\"Extra Ball\" harder to light, since the center target will have\nto be hit five times minimum.\n  Mystery feature always awards 1,000 points.  This basically\neliminates this random feature from the game. Except, this\nawards \"Super Riot\" when the goals exceed 49 goals (50+ goals)\nor mystery awards automatic multiball on last ball if this\nplayer has not played multiball yet and won challenge matches\nare less than five (we do not want to award World Championship\nfrom mystery).\n  Do not qualify the \"Penalty Kick\" feature from the left side\nrollover.  This eliminates the \"Milking\" the goal possibility\nfrom tournament play.\n\n\nIf this game is set to \"Reduced Scoring\" the following features\nare effected:\n\n\n  \"Riot\" shots are reduced from 30M to 20M per shot.\n  \"Super Riot\" shots are reduced from 100M to 50M per shot.\n  \"Points Jackpots are reduced from 30, 100, 300M to 10, 30, 300M.\n  Plunger skill shot \"Adv. goal value\" only advances the goal\nvalue one time (instead of three).\n\n\nIf Extra Balls and Specials are eliminated, then 20M is awarded\nfor an Extra Ball and 50M is awarded for a Special.\n\nGAME RULES\nThe plunger shot is two-fold. if the ball is put into the top\nrollover (a velocity shot), three goals are scored and the goal\nunit is opened for one shot.  or  Shooting the top hole (a timed\nshot), awards the lit value.  Note that the flipper buttons\nchange drop target award, but this must be done before shooting\nthe ball.  The hole lit value possibilities are:\n\n\n \"Mystery\",\n \"Adv. goal value (three steps)\n \"Hit all targets\".\n\n\nStrategy Look at all of your options here, especially in\nthe tournament mode.  Remember to use the flipper buttons to\nchange the Drop Target award value.  If the \"Superscore\" is\nactive and the game enters a round (we can not keep this feature\nactive during a round because of conflicts with the soccer ball\nlamps being used to indicate the time remaining) but when this\nround ends, the Superscore will be lit, but advancing any soccer\nball lamp un-aligns the three lamps, disabling this feature.\n\nRule - Completing all of the Drop Targets awards lit value.\nThese are\n\n\n \"Extra Ball Round\"\n \"Multi\"\n \"Special Round\"\n \"Ball\"\n \"Points Round\"\n\n\nAfter all five have been completed, the award is \"Light Challenge\"\n(Challenge may also be lit from spelling Challenge from the goal unit).\n\nStrategy Try to have it so that the first challenge match is\nfrom the Drop Targets, since losing a challenge match resets the\nDrop target award lamps.  This means that it is possible to earn\nanother challenge match the same ball by simply getting the last\nfew letters from the goal unit.  This makes it easier to get to\nWorld Championship.\n\nRule - \"Spell\" features\nSpell WORLD.  Completing WORLD awards the \"Center Target Round\".\n\nSpell CHALLENGE.  Completing CHALLENGE lights lower holes for\n\"Challenge\".\n\nSpell SOCCER.  Completing SOCCER awards \"Players Choice\".\n\nStrategy Each completed letter is worth 1M in outhole bonus.\nCompleting all three words boosts that up to 100M points\n(total).  If you are close to completing the third word,\nremember that receiving 100M in the outhole may justify a sudden\nchange in priorities.\n\nRule - Soccer Ball Lamps.\nThe left kicking rubber, making a\ngoal or hitting the goal unit when lit advances the left soccer\nball.  The right kicking rubber or making the right ramp when\nlit advances the right soccer ball lamp.  Hitting the center\ntarget when lit advances the center soccer ball.  The object is\nto line-up the three lamps on the same line.  If they are\nlined-up on white soccer balls, then Superscore feature is\nactivated.  If they are lined-up on the top purple row, then\n\"Hurry-up Extra Ball\" is qualified (Left side rollover for appx.\n20 seconds)  Breaking the alignment by advancing one of the\nsoccer ball lamps immediately turns off the Superscore feature.\nThis does not effect the time for the Hurry-up Extra Ball.\nSuperscore awards 10M, 20M, 40M (max.).  This is remembered from\nball to ball for that player.\n\nStrategy As you play, keep track of the soccer balls and when\nyou are one shot away from a \"line-up\", then it may be\nworthwhile playing for.  Save your \"BOO\" for when the Hurry-up\nExtra Ball is qualified.  If no boo is available, then quickly\nhit the goal unit to light penalty kick. then shoot the penalty\nkick to goal combo for your extra ball.\n\nRule - BOO\nPressing both flippers at the same time opens the\ngoal for one shot.  Only one boo per ball is allowed.\n\nStrategy Save your boo for an extra ball shot.  If you are\nlucky enough and the three purple soccer balls are lined up\nduring the plunger shot, then boo here before shooting the ball.\nThis will give you an open goal for your extra ball shot.  If\nyou \"Boo\" at the plunger, then you will get a letter in \"Soccer\".\n\nRule - Goal Value. \nThis feature is indicated by lamps in the\ncenter of the playfield.  This resets to 1M at the beginning of\neach ball.  Shooting the lit target (one of the three left or\ncenter target) advances this value one time.  One of the options\nduring the Plunger Skill Shot is to advance this feature.  The\nsteps are: 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M, 5M, 10M, 25M (maximum).  This\nindicates the point value for any goal scored.\n\nStrategy  Try to get this up before scoring goals, especially\nmultiball.  Look at it this way, if I hit the 10 goal Jackpot\nwith the value at 2M, then I get 20M points.  If I hit the Goal\nJackpot at 25M, then I get 250M points.  Quite a difference. (\nthis means that the 30 goal jackpot is worth a possible 750M\npoints.)\n\nRule - Goals\nEach goal awards the current \"goal Value\".\nCompleting 20 (adjustable) goals awards Extra Ball.  Completing\n50 goals qualifies mystery for Super Riot.  Getting High Goals\nto date awards one Special.  99 Goals are the maximum.\n\nStrategy  Always know where your goal count stands at. Also\nwatch the goal value.  You may find it advantageous to play for\ngoals.\n\nRule - Challenge matches and World Championship. \nThe \"Challenge\nMatches\" are basically short round where the only objective is\nto score one goal. Scoring one goal ends the round and advances\nthe Challenge Matches L.E.D. Completing the last Challenge Match\n(five total) qualifies the two holes for World Championship.\nThis is like a sports playoff structure.  As long as you keep\nwinning, the holes remain lit to enter another Challenge match.\nBut once you lose, the holes are no longer lit for challenge and\nmust be re-qualified.  World Championship is three ball\nmultiball, and the object is to score three (adjustable) before\nmultiball ends.  Scoring that third goal awards 50M points, ends\nthis round, and immediately begins the \"Riot\" round, which now\nlasts for as long as multiball play lasts.  This also resets the\nChallenge Match L.E.D.s.\n\nStrategy The old \"Catch the ball on the flipper and let the\nmode time out to get to the end\" is eliminated here.  If you do\nthat, you will lose the match and be eliminated from the\nplayoffs and be forced to requalify.  Try to plan on which\nflipper you want the ball to be at when these rounds start, and\nshoot to the appropriate hole. Do not lose multiball after\nwinning WC, because it is the RIOT  where the points are at.\n\nRule - Multiball Play.  \nCompleting \"Multi\" and \"Ball\" frim the\ndrop targets lights the holes for Multiball.  You can also get\nmultiball from Players Choice or Mystery.  If the ball is locked\nin the top right hole (plunger Skill Shot) then it will be two\nball multiball.  Otherwise it is three ball multiball.  Here,\nthe plunger skill shot rollover spots all targets and qualifies\nthe Jackpots.  If this skill shot is missed, then completing all\nDrop Targets qualifies both Jackpots.  The goal Jackpot awards\n10 goals, 20 goals, 30 goals, 30 goals ( note that 99 goals are\nthe games maximum).  This must be done during the same multiball\n(resets to 10 goals next multiball).  The Ramp Jackpot awards\n30M, 100M, then unlimited 300M.  As in the goal jackpots, the\nvalue resets.  Once a jackpot is collected, the Drop Targets\nreset, and they must be completed before another jackpot can be\nwon.  One side DOES NOT step the other. If I hit the Goal\njackpot at 10 goals, then requalify the jackpots, now the value\nfor the goal jackpot is 20 goals, but the Ramp jackpot is still\nthe initial 30M.\n\nStrategy Remember to try for the rollover on the multiball\nskill shot, this makes that first jackpot a lot easier to get.\nTry to advance the goal value before going into multiball.\nRemember the consolation multiball on last ball from mystery, so\ndo not waste the plunger skill shot in lighting the holes for\nmultiball, when mystery will award this feature.  Playing for\nthe unlimited 300M is a very big risk.\n\nRule - Penalty Kick.  \nHitting the goal unit or making a goal\nresets the hidden Rollover Drop Target and flashes the upper\nflipper lane for \"Penalty Kick\"  Hitting the Rollover Drop\nTarget when this feature is active opens the goal for one shot.\n(Note that in tournament play, that making a goal DOES NOT\nrequalify this feature).\n\nStrategy Do not go out of your way to play for this feature\nunless a couple of goals will accomplish your objective.\n\nRule - Feature Modes (rounds).  \nThe following features remain\nactive during the rounds (listed below): Spell World, Spell\nChallenge, Spell Soccer (except last letter for all three), Adv.\nGoal value, Goal feature, and Penalty kick feature.  The\nfollowing features are disabled (mostly due to conflicts) :\nSoccer Ball \"line-up\", Mystery, Challenge matches & WC,\nMultiball, and Drop Target awards.\n\n\n Extra Ball Round- Completing all flashing targets awards an\nExrta Ball and ends the round.\n Special Round-  Complating all of the flashing targets awards\none Special and ends the round.\n Points Round-  Completing all of the flashing targets awards\nthe displayed value and advances this value (80M max.), and\nrestores the timer to \"9\" time units minimum.\n Center Target Round-  Each hit on the Center Target awards 10M\npoints.\n\n\nStrategy Remember that during the points round, that a new\ntimer is awarded, so do not give up even though only a couple of\nseconds are left.  Also remember to play for other features\nduring these rounds.  Finally, if Superscore was active when the\nround started, that it will come back as active when the round\nends.\n\nRule - Players Choice.  \nCompleting Soccer awards Players Choice.\nThe options are 8 goals or Multiball.\n\nStrategy  Remember that if the ball is in the plunger skill\nshot hole and you choose multiball, that it will only be two\nball multiball.  If you \"Boo\" and get the last letter of soccer\non the skill shot, the game aborts the lit award.  Use your boo\nwisely. Look at status before shooting the ball and see where\nyou stand on completing \"Soccer\".\n\nPlease note that some of the animations will not allow the \"spell\" features to\ninterrupt them. You don't lose the advance, you simply do not see it happen.\n\nJon Norris\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "World Challenge Soccer", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/worldchallengesoccer.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: World Challenge Soccer", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

The author disclaims all interest in any trademarks\nor other intellectual property referenced herein.\nChanges since version 1.0\n\n Added sounds sampled from the game to the playfield description.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nDescribed from the flippers, and going around the playfield clockwise.\n\nFlippers\n There are two. Normal configuration, normal placement.\n\nLeft Kickout \nShaped like a slingshot, but without the usual slingshot kicker, there is a\ncup that the ball falls into, triggering a switch and a solenoid kickout. Scores\n50 points, and collects the T in S-T-A-R. Hitting the rubbers on either\nside of the kickout\n\nLeft Outlane \nA normal outlane. Scores 500 points. Can be lit for Special by the\nS-T-A-R rollovers.\n\nLeft Wall \nAn ordinary rubber stretched between posts. Scores 500 points.\n\nLeft Goal Saucer \nScores one goal when lit. Scores 500 points.\n\nLeft Super Ball Advance Lane \nShooting this lane does three things. First, it feeds the ball to the Top\nArch via a rollunder. Second, it scores the lit value: 500 (unlit), 1000, 2000,\n3000, or 4000 points. Third, it acts as a super ball advance, lighting Goal.\n\nBall Advance \nA rubber between two posts. It scores 100 points, and advances the ball\nlights one position each time it is hit. This advance is the only one of the\nseveral ways to advance the ball lights toward lighting Goal that will wrap,\nunlighting Goal and starting the ball lights back at their lowest position.\n\nS Target \nCollects the S in S-T-A-R. Scores 100 points.\n\nTop Arch \nStandard arch between two rollunders, one from the plunger lane, and one\nfrom the Left Super Ball Advance Lane. There are two angled sides, each of which\nis a rubber with a scoring switch behind it that scores 50 points. The angled\nsides encourage the ball into one of three exit lanes: the S/T, Goal, and A/R\nlanes.\n\nS/T Rollover \nOne of three possible exits from the Top Arch. This one collects the S\nor T letters of S-T-A-R, advances the ball lights toward lighting Goal,\nand scores 100 points.\n\nGoal Rollover \nSecond of three possible exits from the Top Arch. When lit, scores Goal.\nWhen lit, scores Extra Ball. Scores 100 points.\n\nA/R Rollover \nThird of three possible exits from the Top Arch. This one collects the A\nor R letters of S-T-A-R, advances the ball lights toward lighting Goal,\nand scores 100 points.\n\nRight Super Ball Advance Lane \nSmall lane between the Pop Bumpers and the Corner Kick Lane. Has a rollover\nthat scores 500 points, and advances the ball lights to complete lighting Goal.\n\nR Target \nCollects the R in S-T-A-R. Scores 100 points.\n\nPop Bumpers \nTwo standard pop bumpers, staggered slightly and about two inches apart in\nthe middle top part of the playfield, directly below the three exit lanes from\nthe Top Arch. It is possible to shoot the ball from the left flipper, through\nthe Spinner, between the Pop Bumpers, and into the Goal rollover to the Top\nArch, collecting Goal or Extra Ball if lit, plus whatever you pick up from the\nSpinner. The pop bumpers are placed so that most balls coming from the Top Arch\nwill hit them. Balls coming from the S/T Rollover generally bounce around in the\narea between the pop bumpers and the S Target and the Ball Advance. Balls from\nthe A/R Rollover generally bounce around between the pop bumper, the R Target,\nand the Super Ball Advance Lane. Balls from the Goal Rollover can go either way\nor dribble down through the spinner to the flippers or drain.\n\nCorner Kick Lane \nA horseshoe curve next to the R Target leads to this lane. Like the Left\nSuper Ball Advance Lane, it scores the lit value:: 500 (unlit), 1000, 2000, or\n3000 points and acts as a super ball advance, lighting Goal. The bottom exit of\nthis lane feeds the Right Goal Saucer.\n\nRight Goal Saucer \nScores one goal when lit. Scores 500 points.\n\nRight Wall \nAn ordinary rubber stretched between posts. Scores 500 points.\n\nRight Kickout \nShaped like a slingshot, but without the usual slingshot kicker, there is a\ncup that the ball falls into, triggering a switch and a solenoid kickout. Scores\n50 points, and collects the A in S-T-A-R. Hitting the rubbers on either\nside of the kickout scores 50 points.\n\nRight Outlane \nA normal outlane. Scores 500 points. Can be lit for Special by the\nS-T-A-R rollovers.\n\nLeft Ball Advance Rollovers \nThere are four rollover buttons in the playfield angled between the lowest\none right above the flipper and the highest, just below the Left Goal Saucer.\nOnly one is lit at a time, starting with the lowest. Rolling a ball over the lit\none collects it, scores 100 points, and advances the light to the next button.\nCollecting the fourth one lights Goal. The Ball Advance, S/T Lane, and A/R Lane\nall advance these lights. Super Ball Advance, and the Left Lane and Corner Kick\nLane advance the lights all the way to lighting goal. Ball Advance, if hit when\nGoal is lit, will \"advance\" to having the lowest rollover lit again.\n\nRight Ball Advance Rollovers \nSame as the Left Ball Advance Rollovers. The eight rollovers are set up as\npairs, with either one of the pair counting for that position in the advance\ntoward lighting Goal.\n\nManual Plunger\n This is a normal plunger.  Its lane leads to the top arch.\n\nSpinner \n This is an ordinary spinner in the middle of the playfield, right below\nthe Pop Bumpers. Unlit, it scores 10 points per spin; lit, it scores 100.\nNote: There are no Inlanes. The flippers at the bottom edge of the Kickout\ncups, and it is impossible to trap a ball. Catches, especially drop catches,\nwork, but the ball must be shot immediately, or allowed to roll back into the\nKickout cup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Multiplier\nOne of two keys to a high score in this game. The End-of-Ball Bonus can be\nmultiplied 2, 3, or 5 times by advancing the bonus multiplier. Once advanced to\n5x, advancing the bonus multiplier lights World Cup (Extra Ball) at the Goal\nRollover. Advancing the bonus again lights Super Star (Special) at one of the\ntwo outlanes.\nThe Bonus Multiplier is advanced by spelling S-T-A-R. Letters in S-T-A-R can\nbe collected in any order, but the S/T and A/R rollover lanes always collect the\nletters from left to right (i.e.: if S hasn't been collected, the S/T Lane will\ncollect the S when hit).\nThere is a memory between balls, so collected letters will still be\ncollected at the start of the next ball, though the Bonus Multiplier goes back\ndown to nothing.\nEnd-of-Ball Bonus\nThe bonus scored at the end of the ball is 2000 points for each goal scored,\nmultiplied by the bonus multiplier. In a game where the highest scoring shot is\n4000 points, an end of ball bonus of 18 goals at 2000 points apiece, multiplied\nby the 5X Bonus Multiplier is obviously a huge factor in the final score.\nS-T-A-R\nSpelling S-T-A-R does several things. The first time S-T-A-R is completed,\nthe Spinner is lit, and the 2X Bonus Multiplier is collected. The second time,\nthe 3X Bonus Multiplier  is collected. The third time, the 5X Bonus Multiplier\nis collected. The fourth time, the Extra Ball is lit at the Goal lane to the top\narch. The fifth time, Special is lit on one outlane. Between balls, there is a\nmemory on the S-T-A-R lights. Whatever has been collected on one ball is still\ncollected at the start of the next ball.\nTilt\nTilting the game results in a loss of the current ball, and a loss of all\ncollected Goals.\nLeft and Right Lanes\nThe Left and Right Lanes are lit by scoring Goals, alternating between\nadvancing the lit score on each one. The first Goal scored will light the Left\nSuper Ball Advance Lane for 1000 points. The second Goal lights the Corner Kick\nLane for 1000. The third Goal lights the Left Super Ball Advance Lane for 2000.\nEtc. The lanes' maximum scores are 4000 (Left) and 3000 (Right).\nOutlane Specials\nWhen the Outlane Special is lit by spelling S-T-A-R five times, it will\ncycle between the left and right Outlanes each time one of the bumpers is hit.\nTips, Tricks, Strategies\nScore early, score often.\nGoals remain scored from ball to ball (except for Tilt), and count toward\nyour End-of-Ball Bonus for each ball. Scoring the maximum number of goals (18)\non the first ball enables the highest possible score. Keep the Goal lit at all\ntimes, as even when just bouncing around the ball will often fall into one of\nthe Goal Saucers or get bounced up through the center rollover by one of the Pop\nBumpers.\nThe Left Lane is probably the most valuable shot in the game. First, it can\nscore up to 4000 points. Second, it lights Goal. Third, it feeds the ball to the\nTop Arch, where S-T-A-R and Goal can be collected.\nThe Corner Kick Lane is also valuable, but almost impossible to shoot for\ndirectly due to its position. Shots to the Super Ball Advance lane can be\nbounced off the R standup target and into the Corner Kick Lane.\nSettings\nHere are the options available to the Operator of the game, and what I am\nusing for settings on mine.\n\n\n\nOption Number\nDescription\nPossible Values\nComments / Meaning\nFactory default\nCurrent setting\n\n01\nReplay 1\n0 through 99\n* 10,000 points\n16 (160,000)\n16 (160,000)\n\n02\nReplay 2\n0 through 99\n* 10,000 points\n28 (280,000)\n28 (280,000)\n\n03\nReplay 3\n0 through 99\n* 10,000 points\n40 (400,000)\n40 (400,000)\n\n04\nReplay 4\n0 through 99\n* 10,000 points\n00 (disabled)\n00 (disabled)\n\n05\nMaximum credits\n0 through 99\n\n20\n20\n\n06\nMatch/Credit/ExtraBall\n08\nMatch enabled, Credit awarded at Replay Points\n08\n08\n\n\n\n09\nMatch enabled, Extra Ball awarded at Replay Points\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nMatch disabled, Credit awarded at Replay Points\n\n\n\n\n\n13\nMatch disabled, Extra Ball awarded at Replay Points\n\n\n\n07\nPlay\n01\nLiberal Play - Third STAR lights World Cup, Fourth STAR lights Super Star\n01\n\n\n\n\n02\nNormal Play - Fourth STAR lights World Cup, Fifth STAR lights Super Star\n\n02\n\n\n\n04\nNo Special, No Extra Ball\n\n\n\n08\nCredits awarded for high score to date\n00 through 31\n\n03\n03\n\n12\nLeft coin slot multiplier\n00 through 31\n\n01\n01\n\n13\nCenter coin slot multiplier\n00 through 31\n\n01\n01\n\n14\nRight coin slot multiplier\n00 through 31\n\n01\n01\n\n15\nMinimum coins for credit\n00 through 31\n\n00\n00\n\n16\nCoin units bonus point\n00 through 31\nthree credits for two coins\n02\n02\n\n17\nCoin units required for credit\n00 through 31\n\n01\n01\n\n18\nPlay Adjustment\n03\nS and R separate, Special awards credit, 3 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n13\nS and R together, Special awards credit, 3 balls\n13\n\n\n\n\n23\nS and R separate, Special awards extra ball, 3 balls\n\n23\n\n\n\n33\nS and R together, Special awards extra ball, 3 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n43\nS and R separate, Special awards 1500 points, 3 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n53\nS and R together, Special awards 1500 points, 3 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n05\nS and R separate, Special awards credit, 5 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n15\nS and R together, Special awards credit, 5 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n25\nS and R separate, Special awards extra ball, 5 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n35\nS and R together, Special awards extra ball, 5 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n45\nS and R separate, Special awards 1500 points, 5 balls\n\n\n\n\n\n55\nS and R together, Special awards 1500 points, 5 balls\n\n\n\n19\nMaximum tilts\n1 through 9\n\n01\n01\n\n20\nCredits in game\n\nUsed to add credits without using the coin slots\n00\nN/A\n\n21\nHigh score to date\n0 through 99\n10,000 points\n35\nN/A\n\n22\nHigh score to date\n0 through 99\n100 points\n00\n\n\n23\nHigh score to date\n0 through 99\n1 points\n00\n\n\nDocument written by David Gersic dgersic@niu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "World Cup", "manufacturer": "Williams", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/worldcup.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: World Cup", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\nPinball Archive Rule Sheet: World Cup Soccer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 World Cup Soccer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBally's WORLD CUP SOCCER\nv 1.0\nby Greg Dunlap\ngdd@rci.ripco.com\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Bowen Kerins for clearing up a lot of questions,\nmaking corrections and being an all around swell guy!\n\nThese rules are probably pretty stable at this point as the game comes\nclose to going into production.\n\nPlayfield Layout\nThis is sort of left to right\n\n\nLeft Outlane\n Has a kickback which is relit by hitting Light\nKickback Target.\n\nLeft Inlane\n Has a rollover which lights the Light Magna-Save\ntarget.\n\nMagna-Save\n Ah yes! The return of the Magna-Save. But not quite\nthe same implementation as in Black Knight or Jungle Lord or the\nother 70s Williams two-levels. The Magna-Save is just above the tip\nof the left flipper, and is set to save a STDM drain. By punching an\nextra button at the left, you activate the Magna-Save which sucks\nthe ball into place above your flipper so you can catch it. At least\nthats the theory.\n\nSlingshots\n The return of the standard slingshot, no more of this\ntrapezoid shaped junk like Demo Man or ST:TNG.\n\nLight Kickback Target\n This is lit by rolling through the right\ninlane. Hitting it lights the kickback.\n\nLeft Spiral\n This is your standard spiral. When a city is lit, it\nscores the city and sends the ball all the way around and shooting\nout the other side. Otherwise a one-way gate drops down and the\nball falls into the rollovers / pop bumpers.\n\nLeft Ramp\n This ramp normally shoots the ball around in a loop and\nback to the right flipper. If you hit a second consecutive ramp shot,\na diverter closes and sends the ball over to the left flipper. The left\nside of the ramp holds the locking mechanism, implemented here in\nexcellent fashion. If lock is lit, the ball always goes to the left ramp\nlock area from either ramp. I should also note that around the spot\nwhere the ramp is about to curve back towards the right flipper,\nthere is a little hole so that if you don't shoot your ball strongly\nenough, your ball will fall down into the pop bumpers without\nscoring the ramp. The ramps are used to lock balls, collect tickets,\nrelight jackpots, and for points during Ultra Ramps.\n\nStriker Targets\n Striker is this little dog who is the mascot of\nWorld Cup Soccer and he has three standup targets on the\ngame. One on each side of the left ramp, and one in front of the jet\nbumpers at the upper right. Hitting a dog target lights a letter in\nthe word \"STRIKER.\" When you light all seven letters, you get 10M\nand the Striker Scoop is lit.\n\nLight Free Kick\n This is a saucer. Falling in it lights the Free Kick\nstandup target.\n\nTackles\n This is a row of three standup targets (think about Cousin\nIt / Superdog and you get the idea.) Hitting one of them when lit scores\n10M.\n\nAssist\n Another saucer, at the upper left, just in front of the goal.\nWhen the ball falls into the Assist saucer your goal gets lit (or\nnothing changes if its already lit) and you can shoot the ball\nstraight in by punching a flipper. Pretty great.\n\nStar Rollovers\n There are four rollovers (yes rollovers!) leading towards\nthe goal. Light a rollover by rolling over it. Light all four and goal is lit.\n\nGOAL!\n This is really great. At the upper left corner of the\nplayfield there's this wide hole (picture ST:TNG's Neutral Zone if it\nwas as wide as all three targets.) In front of it is this plastic goalie\nwho moves back and forth. You shoot the ball past the goalie and\ninto the goal. Its tougher than it sounds - he's good! When you hit\nthe goal the machine yells \"GOAL!\" and there's a great animation\nand the crowd cheers! Hitting the goal when its not lit will score the\nStriker Scoop award when you haven't collected a Striker award yet. 4 lit\nGoals lights a TV award.\nThere are also a couple of modes which run along a theme of hitting\nthe goalie, which I find really amusing. Goal also serves as the\nmultiball jackpot.\n\nStriker Scoop\n This is a small little scoop in the back middle of the\nplayfield, to the right of the goal. Hitting it when lit serves up a\nseemingly random Striker Award. This also serves as the Extra Ball\nshot.\n\nJet Bumpers / Rollover Lanes\n Three bumpers and two lanes.\nLighting both lanes lights the left spiral to collect a city. Jet\nBumpers are pretty standard three-in-a-triangle-shape. During\nnormal play, the jets are worth 1OOK a pop and add one thousand\nfans for each pop. At 25,OOO fans, the jet value becomes 1M / pop\nfor the rest of the ball.\n\nSoccer Ball\n Theres this great big half-a-soccer ball which spins at\nsuper speed when the goal is lit and during multiball. The thing is,\nthe ball is made of RUBBER! This causes A) much bounciness on the\nupper part of the playfield and B) some pretty extreme spins on the\nball.\n\nFree Kick Target\n When lit from one of the Free Kick saucers, this\ntarget awards 10M. It stands right in front of the spinning soccer\nball.\n\nTV Award / Final Draw scoop\n When lit for TV award, this gives out\na TV Award. There are currently four TV Awards. Also serves to start\nmultiball when lit for Final Draw.\n\nRight Ramp\n Same as left ramp, except this ramp always feeds the\nleft flipper and there are two holes which can drop your ball to the\nbumpers instead of just one. Serves same purposes as left ramp.\n\nLight Free Kick saucer\n There is another Light Free Kick Saucer to\nthe right of the right ramp. See above.\n\nLight Magna Save target\n When lit, hitting this target lights the\nMagna-Save. This target is lit by rolling through the left inlane.\n\nRight Inlane\n Rolling through this inlane lights the Light Kickback\ntarget.\n\nRight Outlane\n There is a special light here, which is lit at the end of\nmultiball (see MULTIBALL below.)\n\nPlunger / Skill Shot\n First off, this game has a real plunger. You\nremember...you pull it back and it springs the ball out? The skill\nshot is like one of those loops on roller coasters. You shoot the ball\nup the loop, and it falls into one of three dividers which each have a\nlight. When you start they are all flashing. Falling in one of the\nflashing ones the first time scores 5M. Then only two are flashing.\nHitting another flashing one scores 10M. When you hit the last\nflashing one you spot a city for 30M!\n\n\n\nRules\n\nGOALS\n For some reason, hitting goals is the funnest thing in the\nworld. You start each ball with the goal lit (at least you do on the\nmachine I play.) Shooting a goal scores 10M, adds 5M to fun with bonus and\nstarts an \"Ultra\" round. There's some great sounds here. When the goalie\nblocks a kick you get \"What a great save!!!\" The voice reminds me a lot of\nthe voice in Banzai Run. You relight the goal by lighting four stars on\nthe playfield. There are two ways to light a star: A) Hitting the dog\ntarget in front of the pop bumpers (called the \"Header\" target) lights an\nunlit star B) By rolling over them! Yes, first the return of Magna-Save,\nnow the return of rollovers! What a great game. After each goal, you are\nawarded an \"Ultra\" mode. There are four Ultra modes (explained below) and\neach one lasts for the length of your ball or until you score 30M on the\nmode, at which time you are given a 10M bonus and the mode ends. The\nmodes you currently have lit are indicated by four lightning bolt-shaped\nlights on the right side of the playfield.\n\nThese modes do not add to your score during the normal game, they\nare only used for fun with bonus.\n\nUtlra Ramps - About what it says. Shoot ramps for 5M per ramp.\nUtlra Spinner - Ditto, to the tune of 1M a spin.\nUltra Jets - This is a pop bumper bonus. Pop bumpers are upped to 2M a pop.\nUtlra Goalie - Nail the goalie! One of two Hit the Goalie modes,\nthese are completely hilarious. Hitting the goalie scores 5Ma shot.\n\nTV AWARDS\n Shooting four goals lights the TV award. Hitting the\nTV Award scoop awards it. Currently there are four TV Awards. A TV Award\nis a timed mode (these were 20 or 25 seconds) for bonus scoring. Simply\nstarting any TV Award is worth a cool 25M. They are awarded in order as\nopposed to randomly.\n\nBig Goal Round - Shoot three goals within the time limit for 15M, 15M and 30M.\nExtra Ball Round - Extra Ball lit for 20 seconds. If you hit the\nextra ball, then the Striker scoop is worth 50M for the rest of the time\nlimit.\nHit The Goalie! - Same as above except timed. Hitting the\ngoalie is worth 10M, shooting the goal raises the goalie value by\n10M. Still totally great.\nWhere's Striker - Shoot any of the dog targets to try and find\nStriker. First hit scores low points, second scores medium points, third\nfinds Striker and scores big points. I still haven't gotten this yet so I\ncan't be more specific.\n\n\nSTRIKER AWARDS\n Hitting a Striker dog target scores 1M and adds a letter\nto the words \"STRIKER.\" Spelling the word Striker awards 10M and lights\nthe Striker scoop. It is also lit at the start of the game. The first\nStriker award may be collected from the goal if the goal is not lit.\nShooting the Striker scoop gives out a random award. The ones I've seen\nare set forth below.\n\n Extra Ball - Guess.\n Multiball - Starts multiball at rank 15 (see below.)\n 20 million - Another toughie.\n Super Free Kick - Makes the free kick target worth 10M + 5M\nper consecutive hit for a certain amount of time.\n Penalty Kick - Gives you a shot at the goal with the goalie not\nmoving and leaning out of the way. hit the goal for 30M.\n Three Cities - Gives you your next three cities (see below.)\n Unlimited Kickback - Kickback lit for the rest of the ball!\n Three Goals - Adds three goals to your total, complete with three\nUltra rounds too.\n\n\nMULTIBALL\n OK, there are four spots with flashing arrows\nlabeled \"BUILD\" in front of them - left spiral, left ramp, right\nramp and Striker scoop. There is also a big soccer ball painted on\nthe playfield with the words Strength, Stamina, Skill, Speed and Spirit on\nit. Shooting a build shot lights one of the words on the ball on the\nplayfield. When you light all five, lock and multiball are lit. Shoot a\nramp to lock the ball, shoot the Final Draw scoop to start multiball. Now\nwhen you start multiball you are given a team to play, based on your rank.\nYour rank is determined as follows - Every two shots to a lit goal\nadvances you 1 rank, and if you lock a ball before starting multiball you\nadvance 4 ranks (since multiball is lit as soon as lock is lit.) You beat\na team by shooting the goal (this is your jackpot,) and then get to play\nthe next team by shooting a ramp (relighting jackpot.) There are fifteen\nteams, with the following ranks and jackpot values:\n\n#15     USA             20M\n#14     Russia          20M\n#13     South Korea     25M\n#12     Saudi Arabia    30M\n#11     Morocco         35M\n#10     Austria         40M\n#9      Canada          45M\n#8      Holland         50M\n#7      Italy           55M\n#6      Great Britain   60M\n#5      Sweden          65M\n#4      Spain           70M\n#3      Australia       75M\n#2      France         100M\n#1      Germany        250M\n\nIf you drain before hitting a jackpot, shooting a ramp or the Final Draw\nscoop will restart multiball where you left off. If you start Multiball\nagain, you are advanced two ranks. For your match against #1 ranked\nGermany, the Special is lit on the right outlane, the jackpot is worth\n250M and after you hit it, the ramps and goal are lit as Victory Laps\nworth 50M a piece! After five laps, the Victory Laps switch off between\nleft ramp and goal. One more thing, the Assist saucer works during\nmultiball, but best of all, its programmed not to miss.\n\nCITIES\n There are eight cities on the World cup tour - Chicago,\nDallas, Boston, New York / New Jersey, Orlando, Washington DC, San\nFrancisco, Detroit and LA. There are three different ways to collect\ncities.\n\n Left Spiral - Shooting both ramps or lighting both rollovers\nlights the left spiral with a yellow arrow labeled \"TRAVEL.\"\nShooting the spiral at this time awards your next city. Actually,\nscoring the spiral doesn't award the city, setting off the spinner\ndoes. And you CAN score it backwards! I have had two cities lit,\nshot the spinner for the first one, and when the ball didn't make it\nall the way up it fell back down and lit the second one!\n Striker Award - There is a Striker award which gives you\nyour next three cities.\n Skill Shot - Hitting all three flashing lights awards your\nnext city.\n\nChicago, Dallas and Boston are worth 10M. New york, Orlando and Washington\nare worth 15M. San Francisco, Detroit and LA are worth 20M. Travelling to\nany city also lights the Tackle target, worth 10M when hit. Several cities\nhave modes associated with them, as\noutlined below.\n\n Boston - Boston Tea Party Mode - A hurry up. Starts at 40M\nand counts down to 10M. Shoot spinner to collect.\n Washington D.C. - Extra Ball - Lights Extra Ball\n L.A. - World Cup Final - After traveling to L.A., shoot the\nFinal Draw hole to start the Final Match against Germany! This is really\ngreat. 5 ball timed multiball against Germany for 45 seconds. You plunge\nthe balls yourself (manual plunger remember) and goals are worth 75M.\nEvery once in a while Germany will score a goal. If you end the 45 seconds\nwith more goals than Germany you get a bonus of 500M!!!! Yowza! If you end\nin a tie, overtime is started and the first team to score a goal wins.\n\n\nBUY-IN\n You can buy an extra ball for 1 credit up to three times.\nWhen you buy in, all four ultra modes begin lit! There are separate\nhigh score tables for x number of buy-ins, but I haven't sorted them\nout yet. Hell, I haven't even sorted out the ones for ST:TNG yet.\nBONUS\n Bonus is awarded as outlined below\n\n 5M per goal\n Ultra Modes are scored however you did.\n 5M per city.\n\n\n\nStrategies / Tips\nMy strategy these days comes down to two things - Cities and Extra\nBalls. The two kind of go together. First off Cities. Getting all the\ncities takes you to the final round, potentially worth endless points.\nAnything more than five goals against Germany will pretty much guarantee a\nwin, and 5 goals + a win gains you 875M! WHOAH! So get good at that left\nspinner shot. Also get good at the right ramp, since you can't light\nTRAVEL without it (unless you go to the rollovers.)\n\nThere are also lots of opportunities for extra balls - three so\nfar, and none of them is that tough. You're gonna need them so pick them\nup ASAP.\n\nThe final thing is if you've ever wanted a game on which to\npractice slap saves and/or outlane nudging, this is it. About 7 of 10\nballs are lost down the middle, making constant slap saves a necessity.\nAnd the outlanes are nice and bouncy, perfect for practicing getting down\njust the right push to save a ball. BTW bangbacks are possible from the\nleft, but they're not easy. Rumor has it the biff bars are getting raised\nin the production version too, which will make it even tougher. I can't\nsee how you would bang back from the right - there's way too much hardware\nover there and you would hurt your hand way too badly.\n\nAnd thats about the size of it. I think the reason I like this game so\nmuch is its lack of gadgets / new technology. Its sort of a step back\nfrom the more recent pins. A real plunger, Magna-Save, and\nrollovers. Think about this, when was the last time you played a\nWMS pin WITHOUT an upper flipper?? Well, okay I forgot about\nIndiana Jones, but I never played it very much. This freaked me out\nthe first few times, every time I hit a spiral I was looking for\nanother combo shot from an upper flipper. Also, since the game's\nmodes are only secondary really, you spend more time planning out\nyour game and really PLAYING as opposed to Piano -> Slot -> Piano\nad infinitum. Most of all, the game is challenging and yet still fun\nas all hell, I'm sure it will be a big earner for Williams, kudos for\neveryone on the design team.\n\nDocument written by Greg Dunlap gdd@rci.ripco.com\n\nDocument converted to HTML by David Gersic dgersic@niu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "World Cup Soccer", "possible_shots": "Left Outlane, Left Inlane, Magna-Save, Slingshots, Light Kickback Target, Left Spiral, Left Ramp, Striker Targets, Light Free Kick, Tackles, Assist, Star Rollovers, GOAL!, Striker Scoop, Jet Bumpers / Rollover Lanes, Soccer Ball, Free Kick Target, TV Award / Final Draw scoop, Right Ramp, Light Free Kick saucer, Light Magna Save target, Right Inlane, Right Outlane, Plunger / Skill Shot", "manufacturer": "Bally", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/worldcupsoccer.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: World Cup Soccer", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

I\nalso added another strategy on collecting the Light EB mode.\n\nOrin Day helped greatly, providing info about some\nmodes that only he would know. :> Also, thanx to Keith Johnson,\nMichael Field and  for help in earlier versions.\n\nPreliminaries\nThis rules sheet is based on version 1.03 of WWF Royal Rumble, not 1.01 as\nI had thought before.\n\nWWF Royal Rumble is the latest Data East machine. Two things are strange\nabout it: first, it's a widebody; and second, there aren't any\neasily-breakable toys. In fact, there aren't any toys at all! There is an\nupper playfield which is integrated nicely into the gameplay. The reason it\nseems weird being a widebody is that there is so much wasted space on the sides\nof the playfield that I think it could have been squeezed into a regular width\ncabinet without any loss of gameplay.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is pretty straightforward. There are some bugs in\nthe software and a few problems that I'd like to see corrected. I've listed\nthe bugs in the descriptions of the parts of the game that they affect. The\nbugs aren't detrimental to gameplay, but they do affect a few of the modes.\nFor now, keeping in mind all common r.g.p abbreviations, let's get to the\nplayfield description.\n\nGeneral Playfield Layout\nLower Playfield Description \n\nLeft outlane  No kickback. It can be lit for a Special.\n\nLeft inlane  Rolling down this lane lights a green \"Lite Macho\" light at the\ntop of the lane for a short time. But gameplay doesn't seem to be affected\nby whether the light is on or off.\n\nLeft lane  This lane runs behind the Left Drop targets. It scores the \"Get\nBack in the Ring\" jackpot when lit.\n\nLeft Drop targets (D-E-A-D)  These 4 targets face right. There are 2 globe\nlights above: the red light is on during Multiball and when the RIP jackpot\nis available, and the yellow light is on during the Raise the Undertaker\nmode.\n\nLeft Start Mode sinkhole  Starts the currently lit mode when lit (duh!). It is\nlit at the start of each ball, and is relit by the Center Ramp. The Right\nInlane also lights this hole, but only for a short time. Balls hit in this\nhole are kicked out of the Center Start Mode hole.\n\nLeft Ramp  This is the ObDESuperSteepRamp. It has a very wide entrance, but at\nthe top it narrows suddenly, causing the ball to bounce back down more often\nthan not. The ball can hit the switch that registers a hit to the Ramp and\nfall back down. It's one of the three wrestler shots. Yokozuna, Doink, and\nTatanka are collected here. 2 globe lights are above the entrance: the red\nlight indicates when the Ramp will feed the Upper Playfield, and the yellow\nlights is on during the Banzai mode. If both are lit, Banzai takes\nprecedence. Two diverters can feed the ball to the Upper Playfield, or to\neither Inlane.\n\nRollover Lanes  Three lanes placed just above the bumpers. The lanes can be\nreached from the Plunger and the Right Orbit. The lit lanes can be rotated\nto the right by pressing either flipper button.\n\nBumpers  Three bumpers arranged in a triangle. The ball leaves the bumpers\ndown the left side of the playfield, and often rolls down the Left Lane.\n\nCenter Start Mode sinkhole  This is a very narrow scoop that can only be hit\ndirectly from the left flipper. You need to flip very early to hit it. The\nball is usually kicked onto the left flipper for an easy catch.\n\nCenter Ramp  This is the second wrestler shot. Bret Hart, Hacksaw Jim Duggan,\nand Lex Luger are collected here. This ramp also relights the Start Mode\nholes; the first shot lights the left hole, and the second shot lights the\ncenter hole. It can be hit easily by either flipper, and balls are fed to\nthe Left Inlane.\n\nT-A-G Standups  There are two banks of three targets each, flanking the\nentrance to the Right Orbit. They are used in the Tag Team Millions mode.\n\nCaptive Ball  This is located just above the left-side 'G' standup. There is a\nrollover switch just behind the ball. You need to knock the ball onto that\nswitch to get credit for a hit. If you hit the ball hard enough, it will\nscore a hit on the right Bumper. It's pretty tough to hit this ball, even\nwhen you're trying.\n\nRight Orbit  This is the third wrestler shot. Crush, Big Boss Man, and Shawn\nMichaels are collected here. It's more like a half-orbit, since it leads to\nthe Rollover Lanes. If a ball is plunged weakly, it can fall back down this\nlane.\n\nRight Lane  This lane is at the far right of the board, at a very low angle.\nIt leads to a VUK, which you must hit to get credit for a shot. The kicker\nsends the ball to the Upper Playfield. Multiball and Macho Madness can be\nstarted by this shot, and it is also used in the Search for Doink mode. If\nthe VUK gets weak, complain, since if the kicker can't reliably make it to\nthe upper playfield, many modes are ruined.\n\nRight Inlane  Rolling through this lane lights the Left Start Mode hole for a\nshort time if it's not already lit.\n\nRight outlane  Can be lit for a special.\n\nPlunger  An auto plunger. It sends the ball to the Rollover Lanes. If the\nplunger is weak, the ball can fall down the Right Orbit.\n\nTAG Button  This is in the same place as the FIRE! button on R&B. It fires the\nautoplunger and is also used in the middle-of-the-ball video modes.\n\n\nUpper Playfield Description \n\nFlippers  2 small Thing-size flippers. When the ball drains between them, it\nis fed to the Right Inlane.\n\nTop Drop Targets  A bank of three targets that can be hit from either flipper.\nThey are used in several modes, Multiball, and are worth shooting for in\none-ball play as well.\n\nTop Hole  This isn't really a hole, but a depression in the metal at the end of\na lane. It can only be hit from the right flipper. It's used in the Search\nfor Doink and Pandemonium modes.\n\nLoop  The loop can be hit by either flipper. The ball goes behind the Top\nDrops and returns to the flippers. Holding up the left flipper will cause\nthe ball to bounce nicely to the right flipper for an easy catch.\n\nExit  Collecting an award on the upper playfield opens a diverter in the Loop.\nShooting the Loop sends the ball off the playfield into a groove in the\nwood, which feeds the ball to the Right Inlane.\n\n\nSkill Shot\nThis is a bit confusing. When the ball is at the plunger, three awards\nare shown in the display, with Hulk Hogan pointing at the awards in order (like\nDNA Man in JP). When you launch the ball, the display says \"The Hulkster\nselects the award he was pointing at\"\n\nHere's where it gets weird. The instruction card says you should nudge\nthe ball into the flashing Rollover Lane to collect the award. However, the\naward, along with 10M points, is awarded immediately after launching the ball,\nregardless of which lane is hit. The award remains in effect for the entire\nball.\n\nIf you hit the flashing lane (which you can lane-change, btw) you get 10M\nthe first and second times, and 20M each subsequent time. If you hit the\nflashing lane, all three lanes will be unlit. But, if you hit some other lane,\nboth that lane and the lane that was flashing will be lit.\n\nThe awards are:\n\n\n3x Bonus  Starts you off with the bonus multiplier at 3x.\nPop Bonus  Bumpers are worth 100K per hit. If the ball hits all 3 bumpers, the\nvalue increases to 1M per hit until the ball leaves the bumpers.\nLong Freeze  Makes the ball saver last longer. There's no light to indicate\nthat the ball saver is on, but trust me, it's longer -- up to 45(!) seconds.\n2x Banzai  increases the value of the Banzai mode shots.\nVideo Bonus  Makes No Holds Brawl (the video mode) easier to win.\nBelt Bonus  Increases the value of the Championship Belt Round awards.\n3-Ball Pand.  Pandemonium will start with three balls in play.\nLong Timers  All mode timers start at 35 seconds, instead of 25.\n10 Mil  10M points just for hitting a button! Wow!\nM-Ball Ready  All the Multiball start shots are immediately lit. This only\nappears when you buy an EB.\n\n\n Get Back in the Ring\nDuring one-ball play, rolling down the Left Lane when it's not lit\nstarts a 15-second timer. Shooting the ball up the lane awards a jackpot.\nThis is a real jackpot, you know, it carries over between players and games? :>\nThe value varies greatly. I've seen it as low as 11.5M and as high as 99.65M\n(yowza!).\n\n Chair Bashing Round\nDuring one-ball play, shooting the ball up the Left Lane when it's not\nlit starts a video mode. There are two wrestlers, each holding a chair. Hit\nthe TAG button as fast as you can to bash the other wrestler with your chair.\nThe first 5 hits are worth 1M each, and each hit after that is worth 500K.\nBut, if you hold up a flipper, you only get 50K per hit. Don't be too overly\npreoccupied with this round, but if it looks like the ball is going to be in\nthe bumpers for a while, by all means, bash away!\n\n T-A-G Targets\nAnytime during play except when the Tag Team Millions mode is running,\ncompleting a bank of targets starts a video mode. Hit the TAG button a few\ntimes within 3 seconds for a 5M bonus. The targets do not reset until you\ncomplete both banks and then hit the Captive Ball.\n\n Captive Ball\nWhen you hit all 6 T-A-G targets, the \"Collect Tag\" light in front of the\ncaptive ball lights. Hitting the ball resets the T-A-G targets and awards\nsomething. Awards I've seen are: 10M, 20M, Hold Bonus. Awards others have\nreported are: Light EB, Light Special, M-ball Ready.\n\nWhen you hit the ball at other times during play, the display reads, \"Next\nCaptive Ball Award: something\" Actually, the display shows the last award;\nthe award you get isn't chosen until you actually hit the lit Captive Ball.\n\n Upper Playfield\nSeveral awards are available during one-ball play. When a mode involving\nthe Upper Playfield is running, the mode takes precedence over everything else.\n\nThe Top Hole spots a letter in MACHO MAN, and opens the Exit. Completing\nthe Top Drop targets advances the bonus multiplier and opens the Exit.\nShooting the Loop awards 1M the first time, 2M the second time, and so on until\nthe 5th shot, which awards 5M and opens the Exit. Hitting 5 loops also raises\nthe base value of Multiball jackpots to 20M the first time, 25M the second\ntime, and so on.\n\nAll awards (except the Loop of course) are still available while the Exit\nis open. Shooting the Exit awards 5M and returns the ball to the Right Inlane.\n\n Macho Madness\nSpelling MACHO MAN lights the Right Lane and Top Hole to start Macho\nMadness. You spot letters during one-ball play by shooting the Left or Center\nRamp when it's not lit for a wrestler or a mode, or the Right Lane when it's\nnot lit, or the Top Hole when a mode isn't running.\n\nThis round is really complex. The object is to complete the Top Drops 3\ntimes, for 15M each time. Then, a 20M hurry-up at the Loop is lit. Hitting\nthe Loop ends the round and opens the Exit.\n\nHitting one target in the bank starts a 3-second timer. If the timer runs\nout, the targets reset and you move on to the next belt.\n\nProblems occur in the timer and the counter that keeps track of how many\ntimes you complete the Drops. First, the 3 second timer doesn't always count\ntime accurately -- it can run out before you even get a chance to shoot the\nDrops. Also, it sometimes resets when you complete the Drops, but not always.\nFurther, the hurry-up may light after you complete the Drops twice.\n\nIn any case, the round ends when you hit the hurry-up, the hurry-up counts\ndown (it times out at 5M), or the timer runs out.\n\n RIP Jackpot\nEach time you complete the Left Drop targets during one-ball non-mode\nplay, a letter in R-I-P is spotted. Spelling RIP awards the RIP Jackpot\n(another \"real\" jackpot) which starts at 11M and change. The letters are kept\nfor each player separately.\n\n Multiball\nMultiball is started by collecting all 9 wrestlers, then shooting one of\nthe following shots: Left Ramp, Right Lane, Loop, or the Top Hole. The first\ntime, you can collect the wrestlers in any order. The second time, you collect\nthem in groups of three, one wrestler at each wrestler shot, and you must\ncollect one entire group of three before moving on to the next group.\nSubsequent times, you collect them in the order: Left Ramp, Center Ramp, Right\nOrbit.\n\nIf, at the start of ball 3, you haven't lit Multiball during the game, it\nwill be lit for you. If you start Multiball on ball 1, you get a 10M bonus.\n\nDuring Multiball, one wrestler shot will be lit for a jackpot. The\njackpots start at 15M (unless you increased that amount by shooting 5 Loops),\nand go up by 5M when you collect one or complete the Top Drops.\n\nEach jackpot has a 20 second timer. If the timer expires, another jackpot\nis lit (but it might be at the same wrestler shot) and *another ball is\nlaunched into play*. The jackpot value goes down by 5M if the timer runs out\n(not sure about this though).\n\nThe wrestlers are lit during Multiball in groups of three. The jackpot\nwill be lit at a wrestler that you have not collected yet. You can shoot the\nother wrestler shots, but that will only mean fewer jackpots.\n\nIf you collect all 9 wrestlers (whether they were jackpots or not) the\nsuper jackpot is lit at the Top Hole. It starts at 100M, and increases in\nvalue while you keep balls in play, and decreases if you hold the flippers up.\n(This scoring scheme was used on DE games in the past, I think \"The Simpsons\"\nwas one of them.)\n\nIf you drain two balls without shooting any jackpots, you can restart\nMultiball by hitting any of the four Multiball start shots within 15 seconds.\nRestarted Multiball begins with only two balls.\n\nLater Multiballs have harder rules. You must hit either the Loop or Top\nHole to start Multiball, and only one wrestler is lit at a time, in the order\nLeft Ramp, Center Ramp, Right Orbit.\n\n How to Play the Modes\nWWF has 9 modes. They are arranged on the board as follows:\n\n\nLight EB Search for Doink Tag Team Millions \n No holds Brawl Sleeper Hold Super Pops Championship Belt Round \nPandemonium Raise the Undertaker Banzai \n\n\nThe lit mode is changed by shooting wrestler shots. Each column\ncorresponds to a wrestler shot: Left Ramp for the left column, Center Ramp for\nthe center column, and Right Orbit for the right column. Shooting a wrestler\nshot moves the lit mode to the corresponding column, or, if the lit mode is\nalready in that column, moves it up one row. Once you complete a column,\nshooting the corresponding shot does not affect the lit mode. The lit mode\ndoes not change during Multiball.\n\nYou start a mode by hitting a lit Start Mode sinkhole, or by spotting the\n\"O\" in MACHO MAN. Both Start Mode holes are lit at the start of each ball.\nBoth turn off when either is hit. One shot to the Center Ramp lights the Left\nsinkhole, and the second shot lights the Center hole.\n\nAt the start of balls 2 and 3, the Light EB mode will be lit automatically\nfor you (if you haven't already collected it, of course) if the amount of EB's\nawarded recently is below the operator's set percentage.\n\nYou can have more than one mode running at the same time. As far as I can\ntell, the software handles multiple modes just fine, although only one mode's\nrunning display will be shown in the DMD.\n\nWhen you start Multiball, all modes in progress immediately END. This can\nhave several consequences. In all modes, you'll get credit for the shots\nyou're already hit during the mode. If you haven't hit anything yet, you may\nget some token points (usually 5M). However it is possible to get exactly ZERO\npoints from a mode (especially Belt Bonus, which never gives out free points).\n\nAll modes that are timed last for 25 seconds unless you pick Long Timers\nfrom the Skill Shot, which bumps the timer up to 35 seconds. The points you\nearn during modes are awarded immediately, and the total you score during a\nmode is displayed at the end of the mode.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the modes:\n\n Light Extra Ball \nThe Left Start Mode hole is lit for an EB, which stays lit until collected.\n\n No Holds Brawl \nThis is a copy of one of LW3's video modes. The display shows two\nwrestlers. Hit the flippers quickly to fill up an energy bar on the left side\nof the display. If your bar fills up before the computer's, you win!\n\nIt's pretty tough not to win this mode. When you do, you get an\ninordinate amount of points -- 17.9M (yowza!). If you start this mode by\nspotting the \"O\" in MACHO MAN, you don't have to do anything! :> You\nimmediately get about 12M.\n\nIn addition to the points for winning the fight, you get a \"pin bonus\"\nwhich will be larger the faster you win the fight. It can be as high as 11M,\nor as low as nothing (if you win this mode by spotting the \"O\").\n\nPicking Video Bonus from the Skill Shot will help you win. You'll only\nneed half as many flipper presses.\n\nWhen the ball is kicked out, hit the TAG button 3 times for a quick 5M\nbonus. Be very careful on the kickout! The flippers are dead during this\nmode, and are not reactivated until the ball is on its way up the scoop.\n\n Pandemonium \nThis is my favorite mode. It's a Frenzy with a twist. The value of the\ntargets depends on how many balls are in play:\n\n\n# balls target value \n 1 250K \n 2 350K \n 3 500K \n 4 750K \n 5 1M \n 6 2M \n\n\nWhen the mode starts, one ball will be in play, and the 25 second timer starts.\nHitting the Top Hole before the timer runs out launches another ball into\nplay. The first time you hit the Top Hole, 5 seconds are added to the timer.\n\nOnce the timer runs out, you can no longer add balls, but the target value\nwill not decrease when balls drain.\n\nYou get 5M just for starting the mode, and the mode ends when the timer\nhas expired and only one ball remains in play.\n\nIf you collected the \"3-ball Pand.\" skill shot at the start of the ball,\ntwo balls will be autoplunged when you start the mode.\n\nThe mode total counter will max at 99.9M, but I don't know if the Frenzy\npoints stop being awarded at that point. I would think not, since mode points\nare awarded immediately.\n\n Search for Doink \nDoink is hiding in one of the following shots: Left Start Mode hole,\nCenter Start Mode hole, Right Lane, Top Hole. The shot he hides in is chosen\nrandomly. Hitting the shot he's hiding in awards 25M, and the other shots\naward 6M per hit.\n\n Sleeper Hold Super Pops \nA bumper mode. Hitting 14 bumpers awards 30M. Even though the display\nsays you need 15 hits, only 14 are necessary.\n\nIf this mode is running when you start Multiball, you get the full 30M.\n\n Raise the Undertaker \nShoot for the Left Drop targets. The first target awards 2M, then 3M for\nthe second, and so on up to a max of 10M. The targets reset after each hit.\nIf you hit two targets at once, you get credit for both of 'em.\n\nSometimes, one of the letters D-E-A-D is highlighted in the display, but\nhitting the corresponding target doesn't do anything special -- it's a leftover\nfrom an earlier scoring scheme, and was left in because it looked nice. :>\n\n Tag Team Millions \nThe TAG Standups are worth 5M each, and you get 5M just for starting the\nmode. If the ball hits an unlit target on one bank and then ricochets and hits\nan unlit target on the other bank, you get an additional 5M bonus. There's a\nbonus for hitting all 6 targets and then the TAG Button, although I don't know\nits value at this time.\n\nI tend to ignore this mode, since the TAG targets tend to lead to left\noutlane drains.\n\n Championship Belt Round \nComplete the Upper Playfield Drop Targets three times to win the\nHeavyweight, Tag Team, and Intercontinental belts.\n\nThe timer starts at 25 seconds, but resets to 20 when you get the ball on\nto the Upper Playfield. Then, each belt is worth 20M, but that decreases 1M\neach second until you complete the drop targets. Collecting one belt resets\nthe timer to 20 seconds for the next belt.\n\nBugs: Sometimes, the timer will not reset between belts, and sometimes\nthe round will end after you collect two belts. Also, when you collect the\nfirst belt, the Top Hole starts flashing. But hitting the Hole doesn't seem to\ndo anything. Lastly, only the first belt's timer is extended by the Long\nTimers skill shot.\n\nIf this mode is canceled by starting Multiball, you will never get some\ntoken points, ever.\n\n Banzai \nHit the left ramp for 5M the first time, 10M the second time, then 15M,\nand finally 20M\n\nCollecting the \"2x Banzai\" skill shot makes the ramp worth 20M for the\nfirst hit and 40M for the second (and final) hit. Seems like it should have\nbeen called \"4x Banzai\".\n\n Royal Rumble (Wizard Bonus)\nAfter completing all 9 modes, both Start Mode holes will be flashing. Hit\neither hole and then all 3 wrestler shots to start this 6-ball Multiball mode.\n\nThe goal is to eliminate all 9 wrestlers. You eliminate a wrestler by\nhitting 20 bumpers or completing the Top Drop targets. The two shots are\nindependent, that is, eliminating a wrestler by one of those shots does not\nreset the counter for the other shot.\n\nEliminating all 9 wrestlers lights all 3 wrestler shots. The first shot\nscores 30M, the second 40M, and the third 50M. Hitting a shot unlights it.\nAfter hitting all 3, all 3 relight, and their values are 40M, 50M, and 60M.\nThis keeps going to a max of 90M.\n\nThe mode ends when one ball remains in play. There is no ball-saver.\n\nAfter this mode ends, the Center Ramp will NOT relight the Start Mode\nholes for the rest of the ball. The Right Inlane will still light the Left\nHole, though.\n\n Miscellaneous Stuff\n\nBonus Multiplier  Completing the Rollover Lanes or the Top Drops advances the\nmultiplier. The multiplier maxes at 9x. If you complete either of the\nadvance shots again on the same ball, Bonus Hold is awarded. Completing a\nshot again lights EB at the Left Start Mode hole. After that, those advance\nshots score 5M per completion.\n\nBonus Hold  You can get Bonus Hold from the Captive Ball or the advance\nmultiplier shots (see above). If you get this on your last ball, your last\nball's bonus is awarded twice. Your bonus is held across any extra balls\nyou collect on the current ball.\n\nFun with Bonus  You get a \"Switch Bonus\" which is just points for hitting\nstuff, and 1M for each wrestler you collected during the ball. The sum of\nthose two amounts is multiplied by the bonus multiplier.\n\nRandom bonuses  Sometimes, you'll get a \"Goose Egg\" bonus of 10M at the end of\nNo Holds Brawl (this is awarded at random times). Hitting a Start Mode\nscoop will sometimes award a \"Happy Face Bonus\" of 20M (this is NOT random,\nbut the conditions that give the award are unknown).\n\nCombo Shot  Shooting the Left Ramp, then the Center Ramp, and then the Right\nOrbit awards 10M.\n\nEB Buy-In  You can buy an EB only once. When you do, one of the Skill Shot\nchoices will be \"M-Ball Ready.\" If you collect an EB during your bought\nball, \"M-Ball Ready\" will again be a Skill Shot choice. Cancel the Buy-in\nby pressing both flippers or the start button.\n\nOutlane Specials  Both outlanes are lit at the same time, and stay lit for the\nduration of the ball. The outlanes are lit by either a Captive Ball award,\nor by having a low score at the start of ball 3. (But just last week I had\n291M at the start of ball 3, and the Specials were lit. shrug)\n\nMatches and high scores  The current settings on the WWF here are 3 credits\nfor the #1 score, one credit for #2, and none for #3-#6. Beware of the\nmatch sequence. If you see that you have matched, wait for the thwack.\nThe credit isn't awarded until the match animation finishes.\n\n\n Strategies\n Multiball \nWhen Multiball starts, you should be able to complete the Upper Drop\ntargets once or twice before the autoplunged balls make their way to the lower\nflippers.\n\nThe toughest shot is the Left Ramp. It's hard enough hitting it when one\nball is out, so hitting it during Multiball for a jackpot is nearly impossible.\nIf you feel confident, you might want to let one ball drain and catch the\nremaining two, one on each flipper. That should set up at least 2 clear\njackpot shots.\n\nIf you have time to glance up at the display during multiball, do so and\ncheck the timer. If it's about to run out, you can wait and let another ball\nbe plunged. But if you hold the flippers up, the timer will stop counting\ndown, so you must keep the balls moving.\n\n Getting the Extra Ball mode \nThe first thing I go for is the Light EB mode. The easiest way is to hit\nthe center ramp until Search for Doink is lit, then pass the ball to the right\nflipper and go for the Left Ramp. That will move the lit mode to Light EB.\n\nNow, you should have the ball coming to an inlane. If the Start Mode hole\nreachable from that flipper is lit, just shoot it. If not, you have more work\nto do. You can't hit the Center Ramp to relight the holes, since that would\nunlight Light EB. So, shoot the Right Lane, fool around on the Upper Playfield\nfor a while, and when the ball drains it will go to the Right Inlane, which\nlights the Left Start Mode hole! Presto!\n\nThis strategy will change if you've already completed the center column of\nmodes. To get to Light EB, you'll have to hit one of the other two wrestler\nshots repeatedly, but you can hit the Center Ramp to relight the Start Mode\nholes if necessary.\n\nNew Strategy!\nIf you haven't collected the \"O\" in MACHO MAN yet,\nproceed as above to get the Light EB mode lit, and get the ball on the Upper\nPlayfield. Then just keep hitting the Top Hole until the O is spotted. When\nthe ball drains from the Upper Playfield, it'll be fed to the Right Inlane for\na clear shot at the EB.\n\n Upper Playfield \nThe Loop is tremendously easy to hit. You can keep shooting it with the\nleft flipper without catching the ball, but for me at least, it's easier to\npass the ball and use the right flipper. If you can get the hang of shooting\nthe Loop repeatedly, do so for an easy 15M and bigger jackpots.\n\nThe Drop Targets are easy also, but the trick is to be able to hit them\nwithout accidentally shooting the Exit. If you get good at them, hit them\nrepeatedly for a 9x multiplier and an EB lit at the Left Start Mode hole.\n\n Abuse \nWhen the Exit is open, the Loop (which is the easiest shot) is not\navailable. Hold onto the ball. The Exit diverter will overheat after a while,\nand it will move back to its resting position. When it does, resume shooting\nthe Loop. When the Exit diverter opens again, repeat.\n\nOn all but the earliest versions, this has been fixed. The Exit diverter\nresets when you hold the ball, and it opens the Exit again as soon as you flip\nor lower either flipper.\n\nIf the diverter breaks, you can continue shooting the Loop for the normal\nawards and raise the jackpot value.\n\n Bug Reports & Opinions Section\nAside from the software bugs I've mentioned above, there are a couple of\nothers that I've run across. Once, the game froze during the EB Buy-in\ncountdown. Nothing short of a power-cycle helped. Also, if you happen to\ntilt at just the wrong time, the machine will go into infinite ball search\nmode, which will eventually end, but it takes a good 20 or 30 seconds.\n\nOnce, when I had completed all 9 modes but not yet hit a Start Mode hole,\nI managed to get the Left Mode Start lit solidly (not flashing as they usually\nare after all 9 modes are over). Of course, I was curious and shot the hole.\nWell, the Banzai mode started, but all the GI was off and the ramp didn't award\npoints. Even more, I couldn't start the Wizard Bonus round! :( I wish I knew\nhow I got that Start Mode lit, so I could warn you about it.\n\nIf you spot the \"O\" in MACHO MAN after completing all 9 modes but before\nstarting the Wizard Bonus, the display will act like it's starting a new mode,\nbut in reality nothing will happen.\n\nThe VUK in the Right Lane, after about a week of play, has become too weak\nto reliably kick the ball to the upper playfield. This ruins any mode that\nruns on the Upper Playfield, like Macho Madness.\n\nThe kicker in the Center Mode Start hole is erratic. Once I saw a ball\nkicked straight into the Left Outlane!\n\nBalls rolling slowly down the Left Lane bounce off the top of the left\nslingshot, and so lots of nudging is required to move the ball away from the\noutlane.\n\nThe hardware in WWF needs to be working well for the game to be good. The\nbumpers especially MUST be maintained. If they get weak, or fail to kick when\nhit lightly, the Wizard Bonus is ruined. One weak flipper will make play very\ndifficult.\n\nWhy why why is the Wizard Bonus a bumper mode? Why do bumper modes\nexist?\n\nOn a positive note, neither ramp seems to lead to SDTM drains. Balls\ncoming down the Center Ramp can usually be caught, but balls coming off the\nLeft Ramp will be moving too quickly to be controlled.\n\nAll in all, when nothing's weak or broken, WWF is a pretty decent DE pin.\nI hope the hardware problems I described are particular to the machine here at\nUCLA. It's at least a good (and cheaper) distraction when TNG and WCS are\noccupied. :>\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n\n HTML added by David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "WWF Royal Rumble", "manufacturer": "Data East", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/wwfroyalrumble.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: WWF Royal Rumble", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}

This\nrulesheet is based on the X-Files that I played that is in an arcade\nthat is located between 15th and 16th Streets on Chestnut Street in\nCenter City Philadelphia.\n\nAbbreviations usd in this rulesheet:\n\n\n K: 1,000 points\n TD: trapdoor\n MB: multiball\n DMD: dot matrix display\n EB: extra ball\n SDTM: straight down the middle\n IIRC: if I recall correctly\n J: jackpot\n SJ: super jackpot\n DJ: double jackpot\n M: million\n IMO: in my opinion\n\n\nLAYOUT (clockwise from the bottom up)\nStandard left flipper and in/outlane. The inlanes have a yellow circle\nwith a black X in the center; I think these are used in the skill shot\n(see below).\n\nSlingshot, rather small\n\nThree red plastic targets which are used to increase the TRUTH and MB\njackpot values\n\nLeft outer orbit which feeds the bumpers\n\nLeft inner orbit\n\nLeft ramp which can feed to either flipper via a diverter on the right\nhand side of the machine. The diverter is of the type that pops up and\ndown, like the one seen on Medieval Madness, to let the ball go to\neither flipper: diverter down, ball goes to left flipper and diverter\nup, ball goes to right flipper.\n\nThree pop bumpers and rollover lanes above with the corresponding\nletters E B E\n\nRight inner orbit\n\nRight outer orbit which feeds to bumpers\n\nThree red plastic targets, same as on the left which do the same thing\nas the targets on the left\n\nSlingshot, same as on the left\n\nFlipper and in/outlane, same as on the left\n\nSmall post in between and below the flippers just like the post on\nSpace Jam\n\nIn the center of the playfield is a movable file cabinet that has\nthree drawers, of which the top one opens at certain times to allow\nthe ball to go in it. There is also magnet under the playfield in\nfront of the file cabinet that throws the ball to the side when\nthe cabinet hasn't been enabled for MB (more on that later) or the\ncabinet is MB ready but the shot to the cabinet is not dead on. The\nfile cabinet is also used for the super jackpot shot in MB. The inner\norbits go around the file cabinet.\n\nSKILL SHOT/BONUS COUNT\nAt the beginning of the game, you are presented with two faces, one of\nDetective Mulder and the other one of Det. Scully, that have a box\nflashing alternately around each one. Also an arrow points to each\ndetective when the box is shown around the detective. Your objective\nis to choose Mulder (which is on the right) and Scully (which is on\nthe left) at the appropriate times with the flipper buttons.\nSupposedly, if you choose one detective correctly, you get another\nopportunity to choose the other detective to complete the skill shot\nand the yellow circle in the inlane will light up. Whatever detective\nyou have chosen, that will determine what type of bonus you get\nthroughout the game. Choosing Mulder means that you get a Mulder bonus\nonly in the game (you also hear the quote \"Detective Mulder of the\nFBI.\", IIRC) as you press the right flipper button; same goes for\nScully (the quote heard here is \"Detective Scully of the FBI.\", IIRC\nas the left flipper button is pressed). If you get to choose both\ndetectives then you will get a Mulder and Scully bonus. If you get the\nopportunity for two choices and choose the same detective twice, then\nthe second opportunity will have been wasted. I think you have to\nchoose a detective almost immediately after the game is started\notherwise you lose your chance to choose again. I'm not quite sure\nabout this because there have been times where I've waited, say 5-7s\nafter the game has started and after choosing the flashing detective\nat the proper time got to choose again. I've noticed that in two\nplayer games if the 2nd player isn't ready when it is his or her turn,\nthat player will almost certainly get to choose only once. I guess\nthis is done to keep the flow of the game going, just like the skill\nshot in Frankenstein. I don't know how bonus is determined in this\ngame. After the skill shot is finished, the DMD will tell the current\nplayer to push launch to launch the ball.\n\nMODES\nThe TRUTH: Shoot flashing green lights with black X inside them to\nspot a segment of the large X in the lower part of the playfield. Each\nflashing green X shot is worth 50K. Shots to unlit X's are also worth\n50K. A segment that has been completed\nwill remain green; a segment that hasn't been completed will either be\nflashing (the next one to be lit) or not lit at all. So it takes 5\nshots to start the TRUTH. The inner orbits will be lit first. Shoot\neither one of these to set the corresponding outer\norbit X flashing. Then shoot the outer orbit to set the corresponding\nramp X flashing. When both ramp Xs are flashing, then shoot either\nramp to start the TRUTH. When the large X is completed, you will get a\n4 ball MB in which you have to shoot each orbit and ramp once (you\nwill be awarded a TRUTH jackpot for each shot whose base value is 200K\n(which can be increased 50K every time you hit a set of red targets on\neither side of the machine) then shoot the file cabinet three times\n(all while >1 ball is in play) to get \"deny everything\", \"the truth is\nout there\", and \"trust no one\", in that order, to light Super Jackpot.\nI don't know what happens after SJ is obtained. These awards are shown\nin red triangles in front of the file cabinet with \"deny everything\" at\nthe bottom, \"the truth is out there\" in the middle, and the other\naward at the top. Then shoot the file cabinet again to get the\nSuper Jackpot. You have to time your shot here because the file\ncabinet moves up and down at this point. With more than one ball on\nthe table and the bounciness of this game, that is not as easy to do\nas it looks. (More comments about the bounciness of the game as it\nrelates to modes and MB later in this rulesheet.)\n\nYou can make progress toward, but not start, MB during the TRUTH (see\nMB section) except when SJ is lit.\n\nEpisodes of the X-Files:\n\nShoot the right ramp to spell F B I. Each shot to the ramp spots a\nletter. A flashing light means that letter has been spotted. A solid\nlight means that letter needs to be spotted. F B I is already spotted\nfor you at the beginning of the game. When F B I has been spelled, the\nmachine says \"The FBI.\" and a TD opens to allow the ball to\nbe shot into the revealed scoop. Shoot the ball into the scoop to\nstart an episode of the X-Files.\n\nThere are 8 episodes that I saw (I don't think there are any more):\n\n\n Herenvolk - Shoot ramps to stop alien hunter. A one ball episode in\nwhich you have to shoot the left ramp to collect the count down value\n(the Jackpot) which starts at 420K (and stays there for ~3sec) and\nquickly counts down to 100(?)K then shoot the right ramp to collect\nthe Jackpot. I believe that then you have to shoot the left ramp, then\nright, then left, and so on during the episode. This is a timed\nepisode, I think 20s, that starts after the initial countdown value is\ncollected. My guess is that if you cant shoot the left ramp before or\nduring the initial countdown value (and grace period for it at the\nend) reaches its minimum value then the episode is over.\n\n Hambug - Shoot flashing ramp to give midnight snack. This is a one\nball 30s episode in which you have to shoot the flashing ramp to\ncollect 250K at start + 50K increase for each successive ramp shot.\n\n Syzygy - Shoot ramps. This 2 ball (at the start) episode requires\nyou to shoot left ramp for 100K then shoot TD for 200K then right(?)\nramp for 300K then TD for 400K and so on until one ball drains. There\nappears to be no limit to how high the value can go. For each\nsuccessive shot made in this round, another ball will be dispensed\nup to a max. of 4 balls as long as the next to last ball on the\nplayfield hasn't hit the trough.\n\n Colony - Left shots clone right. This one ball 20s round requires\nyou to shoot the lit left orbits to light the corresponding right\norbits Then you shoot those orbits. The values to collect are 200K,\n250K, 300K, and 350K, IIRC. When the right orbits are shot, the left\norbits stay lit, so there are only 4 shots in this episode (I think).\n\n Talitha Cumi - Find hidden alien stiletto. A one ball 30s episode\nto break lamps that are shown on the DMD. This mode is only 4\nshots-both outer orbits and both ramps. The first shot is 250K and\neach successive shot adds 50K to the value of the shot. The alien\nstiletto will always be in the last lamp that is broken. Total for\nthe mode when completed is 1.4M.\n\n Terma - Shoot the black cancer.  A one ball episode in which you\nmust first collect a countdown value starting at 420K (and staying\nthere for ~3s) and decreasing quickly to 100(?)K by shooting the\ntrapdoor. Then you have 20s to shoot both ramps and all four orbits to\ncollect the trapdoor value. If you don't shoot the trapdoor before the\ngrace period of the minimum of the countdown value is over, then the\nepisode is over.\n\n Smoking Man - Shoot orbits to remember. A one ball 15s round in\nwhich you have to shoot all 4 lit orbits once to collect values\nstarting from 250K and increasing 50K with each successive orbit shot\nto 400K after which point the round is over. Total is 1.4M.\n\n The Host - Shoot ramps to stop flukemen. This is a one ball 20s\nround to shoot as many flashing ramps as possible. I don't remember\nwhat the point values are for this episode.\n\n\nAll episodes give 100K just for starting them. Note that episodes are\neither a multiball or timed (15, 20 or 30s) and that they end when\ntime runs out or when the episode is completed is completed (4, 5, and\n7 from above for completion) OR when you go back to one ball in a MB\nepisode OR when the ball ends.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be a wizard mode (like in Star Wars Trilogy)\nin this game; if there is, I don't know what it is.\n\nThere aren't any lights on the playfield to tell you what episodes you\nhave started or completed.\n\nMULTIBALL\nShoot the file cabinet a certain number of times (default is 5 on the\ngame I played on in Philadelphia) to lower it two drawers so that the\nball can be shot into the upper drawer to start a 3 ball MB. Two balls\nwill be autolaunched from the plunger and the ball shot into the\ncabinet and the two other balls will be served to the right\nflipper. Shoot the left ramp to score J #1 and shoot it again to score\nJ #2. What is nice is that the ball, when shot for J #1, gets fed back\nto the same flipper to be shot up the ramp again and after J #2 is\nmade, the ball is fed to the left flipper for a shot to the right\nramp. :) Then shoot the right ramp to get double jackpot followed by\ngetting the ball into the file cabinet for SJ (which is at least\ndouble the double jackpot). The double and super jackpots are timed so\nif you miss DJ, then you have to get a jackpot again before DJ is lit\nagain. If you miss SJ then, I think, you just have to get one jackpot\nto relight SJ again. A green light on top of the file cabinet shows\nthat the file cabinet is MB ready and a red light shows that SJ is\nlit. If you are able to get SJ, then the whole process repeats over\nagain beginning with jackpot on the left ramp. All of this lasts until\none ball is in play. There is no grace period for the return of lost\nballs at the beginning of MB :( Should you collect no\njackpot before going back to one ball play, then a MB restart is given\n(15s; only once per MB) in which you have to shoot the ball into the\nfile cabinet again.\n\nThere are three ways to increase the base jackpot value: a) A set of\nred targets on either side of the machine (or if a set of targets were\nused already to increase the TRUTH jackpot, the OTHER set of red\ntargets) can be hit to boost the base jackpot value, 500K, by 50K\n(when MB is not in session; I don't know what happens if the set of\ntargets are completed during MB)  b) during MB, hit the file cabinet\nto increase the jackpot by 25K, and  c) each time a bumper is hit, the\njackpot value goes up by 5 (or is it the current bumper value/1000?)K.\n\nEach successive MB ready requires you to hit the file cabinet once\nmore than you previously hit it for MB ready. In non-wizard mode MB\nready will be spotted for you if you haven't done it already in the\ngame by ball 3 (like on previous Sega/DE games).\n\nMB preempts any episode that's running. You can't make progress toward\nthe TRUTH while in MB, but can make progress toward MB while in any\nepisode. If the TD was open before MB started, then it closes during\nMB.\n\nMultiball wizard mode: hold in the right flipper while pressing start\nwill require you to hit the file cabinet the default number of times\nbefore MB ready is enabled.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS STUFF\nShoot the left ramp a certain number of times (default 4 on the\nmachine I played on) to light EB at the right ramp. EB stays lit from\nball to ball. Apparently this can be done only once in a game.\n\nIt is possible to backhand the right ramp, but you have to time your\nshot just right otherwise the ball wont go all the way up the ramp. If\nthe right flipper is weak, then I think it will be very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to backhand the ramp.\n\nMini-loop award: shoot the inner orbits a specified number of times to\ncollect 250K the first time, 500K the second time, ? the third time (I\ndidn't get this far). The number of loops needed to collect the next\naward goes up (I'm not sure by how many orbits though). You don't even\nhave to complete the entire orbit; just triggering the switch will be\nenough to count toward the award. This is nice given the way the inner\norbits are set up (see below).\n\nRollover lanes increase bonus X (2X, 3X, 4X, 6X, and max. 8X), when\ncompleted by lighting E B E. Flipper buttons can be used for lane\nchange. EB is lit at 6X, I think. Yellow triangular lights above the\nflippers show what bonus multipliers has been gotten. Bonus X resets\nat the beginning of each ball; there is no hold bonus in this game.\n\nThe bumpers score 1.5K at the beginning of the game but this value can\nbe increased by 500 points each time by outer orbit shots to the\nbumpers during the game (see below). After a certain number of hits to\nthe bumpers (default 60 ?), super pops become active in which each\nbumper hit is worth 20K. Super pops reset at the beginning of each\nball and I don't even think that it last for the entire ball in which\nit is collected; I noticed that during a certain game that I played,\nsuper pops wasn't active for the entire ball in which it was\ncollected. The bumpers are fairly active, so with a little nudging\nwhile the ball is in the bumpers super pops can be obtained\nrather easily.\n\nThe ramps in this game are a bit too narrow for a slightly off the\nmark shot to go up the ramp. You have to make a carefully aimed shot\nfor the ball to go all the way up the ramp. If the ball doesn't go all\nthe way up the ramp, it falls back down to the inner\norbits via a hole at the side of the ramp (same ramp-hole feature is\nin ID4). A nice feature to prevent \u201chalf way up the ramp\u201d balls  from\nscreaming back at you SDTM.\n\nBecause of the way the inner orbits are laid out on the machine, you\ncan do a left flipper-right inner orbit-right flipper combo or a right\nflipper-left inner orbit-left flipper combo. If you can pull off one\ncombo after another, the mini-loop award will be easy to get. But\nplayer beware: there is a potential problem with this setup.\nIf the ball is traveling very fast through the orbit on a level game\nor the game is not leveled properly, the ball probably will go SDTM\ninstead of going to the opposite flipper.\n\nOther outer orbit info: both orbits feed bumpers on a weak shot when\na) the TRUTH or MB is running or  b) green light/black X is lit. Orbit\nfeeds bumpers otherwise.\n\nThere is a ~5s ball save in which balls that hit the trough switch in\nthis time period are returned. No grace period is given for the ball\nsave :(\n\nSome quotes I heard (and understood) in this game are:\n\na) \"Your resignation is unacceptable.\" Said when a ball drains during\nthe initial ball save.\n\nb) \"Success is imperative in our work, Scully.\" Said when money is\ninserted into the machine.\n\nc) \"Your investigation is faltering.\" One of a number of quotes at the\nend of a game where no match is obtained. Another one I think, is\n\"Your investigation has faltered.\"\n\nThere aren't too many quotes in this game. The only time I remember\nhearing quotes were at the start of episodes, during the ball save,\nwhen money is inserted into the machine, during the skill shot, and at\nthe end of the game after the match sequence.\n\nThe music played during the game is interesting (IMO); it sounds like\ntechno music. But I have to say that the sound quality in this game is\nquite poor. It seems like that the sound quality of SEGA games has\nfallen off with every game since A13. I rate the sound quality in this\norder: A13>SJ>ID4 approx. equal to SWT>Lost World>X-Files. It is\ndifficult to understand many of the quotes said in the game. I played\nX-Files in an arcade where I don't have other games around it whose\nvolume is blasting. The volume of the game is loud enough so you can\nhear the quotes.\n\nMagnet behavior: when the TRUTH is not running: the ball is shot to\nthe file cabinet a magnet comes on briefly and throws the ball in\ndifferent directions. Sometimes the magnet throws the ball into the\nfile cabinet a few times, giving you a few free hits on the cabinet\ntoward MB. If MB is lit, the magnet may throw the ball right into\nthe file cabinet. When the TRUTH is running: the magnet stays on and a\nhard shot to the file cabinet is needed to keep the magnet from\ngrabbing the ball (this feature is useful in this mode (see hints and\nstrategy section below)) otherwise the behavior is the same as when\nthe TRUTH is not running except that the file cabinet will stay closed\nwhen MB is lit.\n\nComment on the bounciness of the game as it relates to MB and MODES:\nbecause the balls bounce around a lot in the game, it is hard to\ncontrol the balls, especially when you have more than more than one\nball on the playfield. The episodes in which you have 15 or 20s to\nmake an unlimited number of shots to ramps or orbits for points  are\njust too short, IMO, in order to do well in them for, say, if you\nmake a shot to an outer orbit into the first few seconds of an episode\nand miss, the ball will tend to bounce around so long that the mode\nwill be almost over before you gain control of the ball again. In MB\nthis bounciness makes getting the jackpots that much harder. It is\nalso very hard to trap balls on the flipper because balls tend to roll\noff the flipper too often.\n\nHints and Strategy\nThere are several ways to get a good score (>=15M, IMO). They are:\n\na) Go for MB and get as many SJs as possible (easier said than done).\nTry to park one or two balls in the bumpers while doing this (not easy\nbecause the ball doesn't normally stop at the bumpers in MB).\n\nb) Start the TRUTH and get SJ. Keep this mode alive as long as you\ncan.\n\nc) If you get any 4-shot modes (Talitha Cumi, Smoking Man, and\nprobably Colony), complete them. It's not that hard and you get 1.4M\nfor each episode. If you should happen to get Syzygy, milk it for as\nmuch as you can. This episode is potentially a large point getter.\n\nd) What would be best is to have gotten all of the above during the\ngame.\n\nAt the start of MB try to nail the first two jackpots with the balls\nthat are fed to the right flipper for you.\n\nDuring the TRUTH, try to get the magnet to hold two (or one, depending\non how many balls are left when some get held by the magnet) ball(s)\nnear the file cabinet. I don't think this is easy to do, though, on\npurpose. It will make completing the ramps and orbits so much easier\n(it's like having a 4 (3 if one is lost) ball MB (or 3 (2) if one has\nbeen lost already) with two (one) ball(s) conveniently out of play for\na while). If you lose all balls not stuck on the magnet, the magnet\nwill release its hold on the balls after a few seconds and the mode\ncontinues if two balls were stuck by the magnet.\n\nSee you at Pin Expo'97 and PAPA 6!\nKoi\nFiff-ty millll-yon!! Out to the cemetery, come on everybody!\nGet the extra ball! Thuhhh Mumushkaaaaa!!\nWell played Thing, you're really on the ball!!!\n\nEditor's Notes\n\n HTML added by  David Gersic dgersic_@_niu.edu\n E-mail addresses have been expunged to prevent web-bot spamming, and Web links have been updated where possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to Rule Sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"pinball_title": "X-Files", "manufacturer": "SEGA", "source": "http://www.pinball.org/rules/xfiles.html", "title": "Pinball Archive Rule Sheet: X-Files", "language": "No language found."}, "type": "Document"}
