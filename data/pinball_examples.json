[{"query": "In the game of \"4 Square\" by D. Gottlieb & Co., released in 1971, how does the scoring system for the pop bumpers work, and how does their lighting condition affect their score value?", "answer": "In \"4 Square,\" the left and right pop bumpers score 1 point when unlit and 10 points when lit. The central pop bumper scores 10 points when unlit and 100 points when lit. The three bumpers never all light up at the same time. They alternate between having both 10 point bumpers lit and the 100 point bumper out, or the 100 point bumper lit and both 10 point bumpers out. This alternation occurs when 1 point is scored, either by hitting a kicking rubber or when either 10 point bumper is hit while not lit. Once the 10 point bumpers are lit, all three bumpers score 10 points, and none of the bumpers can cause the lights to alternate again. In this situation, a player must hit a kicking rubber to switch the bumper lights back, lighting up the 100 point bumper and turning off the 10 point bumpers."}, {"query": "In the Addams Family pinball game, what is the initial jackpot value during Multi-Ball(TM) and how can it be increased to its maximum value?", "answer": "The initial jackpot value during Multi-Ball(TM) is 10M.

It is a hurry-up shot that counts down very slowly, allowing the player to collect it without rushing. If the player successfully collects it before losing the ball, they can earn a potentially large score, which can exceed 400M in a long game. If not collected, it resets to 20M."}, {"query": "In the \"Attack From Mars\" pinball game, what is the primary objective during the Attack Phase, and how does the player achieve it?", "answer": "The primary objective during the Attack Phase is to protect a certain country from the Martians by hitting all 3 targets which make up the force field in front of the flying saucer to lower it, thereby opening up the 3 targets behind it. The player must then hit any of these targets to damage the attacking saucer and score points. The phase is completed by causing enough damage to the saucer so that the drop target in the back stays down, allowing a shot into the hole to destroy the saucer."}]
