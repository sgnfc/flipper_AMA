However, it is crucial for the player to collect it before losing the ball to maximize their score from this achievement. If not collected, it resets to 20M.

The player must then hit any of these targets to damage the attacking saucer and score points. Once the saucer has taken enough damage, a shot into the hole (after the drop target in the back stays down) will destroy the saucer. To progress to the Attack Mars mode, the player must defend all of the countries, after which they \"steal\" one of the flying saucers and start the Attack Mars mode. In this mode, the player aims to hit the ball into the hole (with the drop target not coming back up) to take chunks out of Mars, with the 10th shot destroying Mars and awarding 2.5 billion points.'}]\n"

      "Four pop bumpers are positioned strategically below the F-I-R-E rollover lanes, in a square formation.  The left two pop bumpers are actually located slightly higher up the playfield than the right pop bumpers, which I think really helps the ball action in that area.  Most Firepower games will exhibit very good response and ball action from the pop bumpers.\n",
      "Pop bumpers, when not lit, award 100 points each.  When lit, pop bumpers award 1,000 points each.  Pop bumpers are lit by completing all six Center Stand-Up Targets, located just below the pop bumpers, in two banks of three targets each (see below.)  On first completion of the Stand-Up Targets, two pop bumpers are lit, one left, and one right- one above and one below.  These will alternate as they are hit.  On second completion of the Stand-Up Targets, the other two unlit pop bumpers will be lit, so all four are lit.\n",
      "Rebound switches around the pop bumper area score 50 points.  The sounds associated with these switches, and the sounds associated with pop bumper activation, make for some neat sound effects when the ball is in this area.\n",
      "A single \"bullseye\" stand-up target is located in the top-center pop bumper area- between the \"I\" and \"R\" rollover lanes.  Scoring for this target is often misunderstood by players, due to the three lamp inserts located directly below it.  The target actually scores 1,000 points.  The three lamp inserts below it (mounted vertically on the playfield) are marked 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000, from bottom to top.  These inserts actually indicate the bonus points awarded when the player completes F-I-R-E and POWER (see Lower Right Stand-Up Targets below.)  They do not in fact pertain to the bullseye target.  I have often wondered if the combination of the stand-up target and these inserts were originally designed for some other award, but have not been able to confirm this.  The layout of these two items certainly doesn't seem too logical, so it's perhaps possible that points or award(s) associated with the stand-up target were changed in the game before it was released.  Which leads us to....\n",
      "\n",
      "The bumpers score 1.5K at the beginning of the game but this value can\n",
      "be increased by 500 points each time by outer orbit shots to the\n",

      "Pop Bumpers  this is a standard triangle configuration of 3 pop bumpers.\n",
      "They are behind the drop targets, but you can shoot into them with a shot\n",
      "between the tombstone and drop targets. Balls in the pop bumpers often come out\n",
      "this way. The pop bumpers can also be shot via the left spinner or a soft shot\n",

      "Four pop bumpers are positioned strategically below the F-I-R-E rollover lanes, in a square formation.  The left two pop bumpers are actually located slightly higher up the playfield than the right pop bumpers, which I think really helps the ball action in that area.  Most Firepower games will exhibit very good response and ball action from the pop bumpers.\n",
      "Pop bumpers, when not lit, award 100 points each.  When lit, pop bumpers award 1,000 points each.  Pop bumpers are lit by completing all six Center Stand-Up Targets, located just below the pop bumpers, in two banks of three targets each (see below.)  On first completion of the Stand-Up Targets, two pop bumpers are lit, one left, and one right- one above and one below.  These will alternate as they are hit.  On second completion of the Stand-Up Targets, the other two unlit pop bumpers will be lit, so all four are lit.\n",
      "Rebound switches around the pop bumper area score 50 points.  The sounds associated with these switches, and the sounds associated with pop bumper activation, make for some neat sound effects when the ball is in this area.\n",
      "A single \"bullseye\" stand-up target is located in the top-center pop bumper area- between the \"I\" and \"R\" rollover lanes.  Scoring for this target is often misunderstood by players, due to the three lamp inserts located directly below it.  The target actually scores 1,000 points.  The three lamp inserts below it (mounted vertically on the playfield) are marked 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000, from bottom to top.  These inserts actually indicate the bonus points awarded when the player completes F-I-R-E and POWER (see Lower Right Stand-Up Targets below.)  They do not in fact pertain to the bullseye target.  I have often wondered if the combination of the stand-up target and these inserts were originally designed for some other award, but have not been able to confirm this.  The layout of these two items certainly doesn't seem too logical, so it's perhaps possible that points or award(s) associated with the stand-up target were changed in the game before it was released.  Which leads us to....\n",

      "from the right spinner. Each pop is typically worth 100K a shot. Super pops can\n",

      "The 4 Square playfield includes two sets of targets and three sets\n",

      "in a given set has a corresponding indicator light marked with a\n",

      "along each side just above the flippers.  The lower central portion\n",
      "of the playfield is wide open and contains four rows of sequence\n",

      "Four pop bumpers are positioned strategically below the F-I-R-E rollover lanes, in a square formation.  The left two pop bumpers are actually located slightly higher up the playfield than the right pop bumpers, which I think really helps the ball action in that area.  Most Firepower games will exhibit very good response and ball action from the pop bumpers.\n",
      "Pop bumpers, when not lit, award 100 points each.  When lit, pop bumpers award 1,000 points each.  Pop bumpers are lit by completing all six Center Stand-Up Targets, located just below the pop bumpers, in two banks of three targets each (see below.)  On first completion of the Stand-Up Targets, two pop bumpers are lit, one left, and one right- one above and one below.  These will alternate as they are hit.  On second completion of the Stand-Up Targets, the other two unlit pop bumpers will be lit, so all four are lit.\n",
      "Rebound switches around the pop bumper area score 50 points.  The sounds associated with these switches, and the sounds associated with pop bumper activation, make for some neat sound effects when the ball is in this area.\n",
      "A single \"bullseye\" stand-up target is located in the top-center pop bumper area- between the \"I\" and \"R\" rollover lanes.  Scoring for this target is often misunderstood by players, due to the three lamp inserts located directly below it.  The target actually scores 1,000 points.  The three lamp inserts below it (mounted vertically on the playfield) are marked 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000, from bottom to top.  These inserts actually indicate the bonus points awarded when the player completes F-I-R-E and POWER (see Lower Right Stand-Up Targets below.)  They do not in fact pertain to the bullseye target.  I have often wondered if the combination of the stand-up target and these inserts were originally designed for some other award, but have not been able to confirm this.  The layout of these two items certainly doesn't seem too logical, so it's perhaps possible that points or award(s) associated with the stand-up target were changed in the game before it was released.

      "The 4 Square playfield includes two sets of targets and three sets\n",
      "of rollovers, with each set consisting of four items.  Each item\n",
      "in a given set has a corresponding indicator light marked with a\n",

      "configuration.  There are also two kicking rubber islands located\n",
      "along each side just above the flippers.  The lower central portion\n",
      "of the playfield is wide open and contains four rows of sequence\n",
      "indicator lights, with each row consisting of 4 lights numbered\n",
      "from 1 to 4.\n",

      "SCORING\n",
      "\n",
      "Four pop bumpers are positioned strategically below the F-I-R-E rollover lanes, in a square formation.  The left two pop bumpers are actually located slightly higher up the playfield than the right pop bumpers, which I think really helps the ball action in that area.  Most Firepower games will exhibit very good response and ball action from the pop bumpers.\n",
      "Pop bumpers, when not lit, award 100 points each.  When lit, pop bumpers award 1,000 points each.  Pop bumpers are lit by completing all six Center Stand-Up Targets, located just below the pop bumpers, in two banks of three targets each (see below.)  On first completion of the Stand-Up Targets, two pop bumpers are lit, one left, and one right- one above and one below.  These will alternate as they are hit.  On second completion of the Stand-Up Targets, the other two unlit pop bumpers will be lit, so all four are lit.\n",
      "Rebound switches around the pop bumper area score 50 points.  The sounds associated with these switches, and the sounds associated with pop bumper activation, make for some neat sound effects when the ball is in this area.\n",
      "A single \"bullseye\" stand-up target is located in the top-center pop bumper area- between the \"I\" and \"R\" rollover lanes.  Scoring for this target is often misunderstood by players, due to the three lamp inserts located directly below it.  The target actually scores 1,000 points.  The three lamp inserts below it (mounted vertically on the playfield) are marked 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000, from bottom to top.  These inserts actually indicate the bonus points awarded when the player completes F-I-R-E and POWER (see Lower Right Stand-Up Targets below.)  They do not in fact pertain to the bullseye target.  I have often wondered if the combination of the stand-up target and these inserts were originally designed for some other award, but have not been able to confirm this.  The layout of these two items certainly doesn't seem too logical, so it's perhaps possible that points or award(s) associated with the stand-up target were changed in the game before it was released.  Which leads us to....\n",
      "\n",
      "The bumpers score 1.5K at the beginning of the game but this value can\n",
      "be increased by 500 points each time by outer orbit shots to the\n",
      "bumpers during the game (see below). After a certain number of hits to\n",
      "the bumpers (default 60 ?), super pops become active in which each\n",

      "this way. The pop bumpers can also be shot via the left spinner or a soft shot\n",

      "\n",
      "Four pop bumpers are positioned strategically below the F-I-R-E rollover lanes, in a square formation.  The left two pop bumpers are actually located slightly higher up the playfield than the right pop bumpers, which I think really helps the ball action in that area.  Most Firepower games will exhibit very good response and ball action from the pop bumpers.\n",
      "Pop bumpers, when not lit, award 100 points each.  When lit, pop bumpers award 1,000 points each.  Pop bumpers are lit by completing all six Center Stand-Up Targets, located just below the pop bumpers, in two banks of three targets each (see below.)  On first completion of the Stand-Up Targets, two pop bumpers are lit, one left, and one right- one above and one below.  These will alternate as they are hit.  On second completion of the Stand-Up Targets, the other two unlit pop bumpers will be lit, so all four are lit.\n",
      "Rebound switches around the pop bumper area score 50 points.  The sounds associated with these switches, and the sounds associated with pop bumper activation, make for some neat sound effects when the ball is in this area.\n",
      "A single \"bullseye\" stand-up target is located in the top-center pop bumper area- between the \"I\" and \"R\" rollover lanes.  Scoring for this target is often misunderstood by players, due to the three lamp inserts located directly below it.  The target actually scores 1,000 points.  The three lamp inserts below it (mounted vertically on the playfield) are marked 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000, from bottom to top.  These inserts actually indicate the bonus points awarded when the player completes F-I-R-E and POWER (see Lower Right Stand-Up Targets below.)  They do not in fact pertain to the bullseye target.  I have often wondered if the combination of the stand-up target and these inserts were originally designed for some other award, but have not been able to confirm this.  The layout of these two items certainly doesn't seem too logical, so it's perhaps possible that points or award(s) associated with the stand-up target were changed in the game before it was released.  Which leads us to....\n",
