No major\\nchanges have been made from the previous version, although\\nthere is more detailed information about a few things, including\\npreliminary information about TAF Gold,\\nthe 1994 collector\\'s edition of the game that has\\nbeen produced.\\n Comments and suggestions are always welcome. You can send\\ne-mail to gt6139a@prism.gatech.edu\\nCredit to those people who have contributed in some way to\\nthis guide appears at the end.\\n These rules describe play on normal default settings and\\non machines without broken diverters or faulty switches. See\\nthe section on \"Defaults\" for a listing of defaults and operator-settable\\noptions. See your operator if anything\\'s broken :-)\\n This is a special version of this rulesheet formatted especially\\nfor the World Wide Web. Your comments on this new presentation\\nof the rules are also welcome.\\n The Addams Family is a trademark of Williams/Bally,\\nInc. This rules sheet is, however, entered into the public\\ndomain. You may freely copy and distribute it as long as you\\ndo not alter any of its contents, including this disclaimer.\\n\\nStarting the Game\\n\\nThis information is provided for newcomers to pinball who may\\nbe unfamiliar with the machines. Insert coins into the machine\\nto accumulate credits. The display will show the number of credits\\nyou\\'ve put on the game. Press Start once for each player in\\nthe game; you may play up to four players at once, and you may\\nadd players until the beginning of ball 2. Do not press Start\\nthereafter until all players have finished their games; otherwise,\\nall players\\' games will be aborted and a new, one-player game\\nwill start.\\n On the newer Addams Family Gold Edition,\\nyou may buy an extra ball at the end of the game for 1 credit.\\nAll game features and scores resume as they were at the end\\nof the game.\\n\\nGeneral Playfield Description and Basic Rules\\n\\nThis section contains the basic game rules, shot by shot. Specific\\nrules about timed rounds, multiball, and other major game features\\nwill come later.\\n\\nMillion Plus\\nRamp (Side Ramp):\\nEach left ramp shot scores 1M, 2M, 3M,\\netc. up to a maximum of 10M*; this value resets at the beginning\\nof each ball. Each shot also lights a letter in THING if THING\\nhas not yet been completed, spots the first unlit GRAVE target,\\nlights the electric chair, and feeds the ball (with a properly\\nworking diverter) to Thing\\'s Flipper. This ramp is also used\\nto collect Stars when lit via the left loop, and to score Super\\nJackpots during multiball. This ramp has a gate which scores\\n5130 points in both directions and loudly fires the ramp diverter.\\n\\nBear Kick Ramp\\n(Center Ramp):\\nEach center ramp shot awards 1 Bear Kick\\n(2 when lit via the near left inlane), lights the Electric Chair\\nif it is not lit, and returns the ball down the right inlane.\\nWhen Thing Flips is lit, it sends the ball to Thing\\'s flipper\\ninstead. Extra balls and free mansion rooms are awarded at various\\nnumbers of bear kicks. This ramp has a gate which scores 5130\\npoints in both directions. It is also the \"V\" grave target.\\nSee \"Bear Kicks\".\\n\\nElectric Chair\\n(Left Sinkhole/Kickout):\\nLocated just above the left flipper. When\\nthe yellow lamp is lit, it awards the currently flashing Mansion\\nRoom and kicks the ball back out, hopefully to the left flipper.\\nWhen the red lamp is lit, it begins Multi-Ball(TM). The right\\ninlane lights the chair for a mansion room temporarily; either\\nthe center ramp or the left ramp lights it permanently. On normal\\nsettings, the Electric Chair is lit at the beginning of each\\nball. (Note: for the remainder of the rules sheet, to say that\\nthe \"electric chair is lit\" means that the yellow lamp above\\nthe electric chair is lit.)\\n\\nSwamp Kickout\\n(Right Sinkhole/Kickout):\\nAwards mansion rooms whenever the Electric\\nChair ordinarily would (i.e. the yellow lamp is lit). Kicks\\nthe ball back out, hopefully to the right flipper. This shot\\nis also the \"E\" target in GRAVE. Shots to the vault, Thing\\'s\\nbox, and the swamp are fed here.\\n\\nSwamp (Side\\nWide Sinkhole):\\nLocated along the right side of the playfield,\\njust below the upper right flipper. Scores the Graveyard Value\\nduring normal play, or five times the Graveyard Value when lit\\nby sending the ball through the opto just below the mini-flipper.\\nThe swamp locks balls when lit. Balls exit the swamp through\\nthe swamp kickout.\\n\\nTrain Wreck\\nTarget (Back Left Corner Target):\\nThis shot is most easily made from the\\nupper right flipper. Located to the right of the Million Plus\\nRamp, it scores 1M ordinarily; at certain levels, it scores\\n5M and a \"Train Wreck\". Each Train Wreck prevents the Graveyard\\nValue from resetting at the beginning of the next ball. On normal\\nsettings, four Train Wrecks lights an extra ball. The first\\nTrain Wreck takes 2 hits; the second takes 3 hits; and so on\\nup to a maximum of 6 hits per train wreck.\\n\\nGraveyard Jet Bumpers:\\nAdvances the Graveyard Value by 10K for unlit bumpers, 20K for\\nlit bumpers, and 30K for flashing bumpers. Bumpers are advanced\\nby any of the unlit GRAVE targets (see below). The Graveyard\\nvalue is initially 1M at the beginning of each ball (unless\\nit has been held by a Train Wreck), and increases to a maximum\\nof 4M. Each jet bumper hit also changes the currently flashing\\nmansion room, moving from left to right first, then bottom to\\ntop.\\n\\nGRAVE targets:\\nThe two targets \"G\" and \"R\" are located\\njust beneath the jet bumpers. \"A\" is to the left of the Bear\\nKicks Ramp. \"V\" is not a standup target but instead is the center\\nramp. Likewise, \"E\" is the swamp kickout entrance. Complete\\nGRAVE to score the GRAVE bonus of 2M, 3M, 4M, etc. to a maximum\\nof 10M for the duration of the game. Each unlit GRAVE target\\nalso advances a jet bumper. Any shot to the Million Plus ramp\\nwill spot the first unlit GRAVE target.\\n\\nCousin It (Standup Targets):\\nFour standup targets above the Electric Chair most easily hit\\nby the upper right flipper, though it can be hit from the lower\\nright as well (think Superdog targets from Funhouse); it ordinarily\\njust produces a sound effect, \"It, old man!\", and scores 250K\\npoints. It is used mainly in the Cousin It round.\\n\\nBookcase/Vault (Target/Sinkhole):\\nThe bookcase is a large target to the right of the bear kicks\\nramp. Each bookcase hit spots a letter in GREED; spell GREED\\nto open the vault (a sinkhole behind the bookcase). During multiball\\nit also adds to the jackpot value. The vault is used to lock\\nballs, start Multi-Ball(TM), score Quick Multiball jackpots,\\nand relight the Super Jackpot. Two lamps are above the vault\\n-- the red lamp is lit whenever multiball start or quick multiball\\njackpots are lit; the green lamp is lit whenever the vault is\\nopen to lock a ball.\\n\\nThing Ramp: \\nThis is a small metal ramp to the left of the Bear Kicks ramp\\nthat feeds the ball to Thing\\'s Eject. There are two lamps above\\nthis ramp -- the green lamp indicates that a shot here will\\nlock the ball, and the yellow lamp means that \"Thing Bonus\"\\nis lit. Thing ramp shots also starts Quick Multiball and Thing\\nMultiball, and is lit to collect extra balls.\\n\\nThing\\'s Eject:\\nThis eject is used to score the Skill Shot, and when lit starts\\nQuick Multiball or Thing Multiball, restarts Multi-Ball(TM),\\nlocks balls, awards THING bonus, or awards extra balls. It is\\nusually made during game play by shooting the Thing ramp (see\\nabove), but all Thing awards except the skill shot can be collected\\nfrom either.\\n\\nThing (Gimmick Hand):\\nYes, Thing himself! He resides in a box and occasionally comes\\nout to pick up a ball in Thing\\'s Eject, using a magnet. When\\nhe does, the ball is either carried away to the swamp, or Thing\\nreappears and releases the ball in the eject.\\n\\nAdv X Lane\\n(Left Loop):\\nThis is a lane that runs from the back\\nof the jet bumpers around the machine to the upper right flipper.\\nWhen \"Adv X\" is lit via the right inlane, shooting this lane\\nin either direction advances the bonus multiplier from 1 to\\na maximum of 5, valid only for the current ball. Regardless,\\nshooting the lane through the bumpers to the upper right flipper\\nlights \"Lite Star\" on the Million Plus Ramp. This shot is part\\nof all combos. The lit \"Adv X\" times out in a few seconds.\\n\\nThe Power:\\nThe infamous magnets beneath the playfield.\\nTwo distinctive Williams lightning bolts in the middle of the\\nplayfield and two bright side flashers start up when the Power\\nis active. The Power wreaks havoc during the Seance round, when\\nMansion Multiball is lit, and during Mansion Multiball.\\n\\nNear Left Inlane: \\nLights \"2 Bear Kicks\" on the center ramp. This award times out\\nin a few seconds. It is always lit.\\n\\nFar Left Inlane: \\nLights \"Thing Flips\" on the center ramp when lit; a center ramp\\nshot will then be diverted to Thing\\'s flipper for an automatic\\nflip towards the swamp. The ramp times out in a few seconds.\\nThe inlane is not always lit; see \"Thing Flips\" for more details.\\n\\nRight Inlane: \\nAlways lights \"Adv X\" lane for a few seconds, and if the Electric\\nChair is unlit, lights it temporarily for a few seconds.\\n\\nSwamp Millions Targets: \\nWhenever 5X Graveyard is lit, these targets award 1M points\\neach. There are three targets, two below and one just above\\nthe entrance to the swamp. These targets time out just as 5X\\nGraveyard does, and can be hit multiple times until it does.\\nThey also help Thing determine how well he\\'s autoflipping.\\n\\nLeft/Right\\nOutlanes:\\nWhen lit they score \"Special\" (on normal\\nsettings, this is a replay). \"Special\" can only be lit by Touring\\nthe Mansion, and normally only one outlane is lit at a time.\\n\\nSkill Shot\\n\\nEach time a ball is placed in the plunger lane, you have a chance\\nto score the \"Skill Shot\". Hit the ball into Thing\\'s eject for\\n2M the first time, then 3M, then 4M, and finally a maximum of\\n5M. These values increase for the duration of the game. Balls\\nwhich do not land in the eject may circle around into the Jet\\nBumpers on a hard shot, miss the eject but still land in that\\narea on a close shot, or fall into the swamp on a soft shot.\\nIf the ball misses the eject but does not touch any playfield\\nswitch, you may safely let it drain and get the ball back. In\\nother words, you cannot score zero points on a ball (without\\ntilting). The switch in the plunger lane near the swamp and\\nthe one just above the plunger do not count since they score\\nno points.\\n\\nBear Kicks\\n\\nThe number of Bear Kicks accumulates throughout the game. You\\nbegin with 1 Bear Kick; each center ramp adds 1 to this value,\\nor 2 when the \"2 Bear Kicks\" light has been lit via the near\\nleft inlane.\\n At a certain level of bear kicks, an extra ball will be\\nlit at Thing\\'s Eject. This value normally reflexes according\\nto recent game play, but it is usually around 8 or 9. It is\\nno less than 6 bear kicks, but apparently it has no maximum.\\n At 15, 25, 35, and 45 bear kicks, mansion rooms are spotted.\\nThe currently flashing mansion room will be awarded as if\\nyou had hit the electric chair or the swamp kickout, and happens\\neven if the electric chair is not lit. Mansion rooms are not\\nspotted during any of the multiballs; when the multiball finishes,\\none more center ramp shot will spot the room. (I\\'m not sure\\nif you can stack mansion spots or not.) If you shoot the lit\\nelectric chair or swamp kickout before the room is spotted,\\nthat room will be announced before the one that was spotted.\\nThe \"?\" panel cannot be spotted by bear kicks.\\n Another extra ball is available at 50 bear kicks. This value\\ndoes not reflex according to game play, but may be manually\\nadjusted by the operator.\\n Mansion rooms are also spotted at 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95\\nbear kicks.\\n On the 99th bear kick, and every bear kick after that, a\\n\"Super Bear Kick\" is scored. This is just 5M points, a neat\\nanimation showing \"Super Bear Bonus\", and a few booms off\\nthe sound board. At this point, no more mansion rooms can\\nbe spotted, no more extra balls can be lit via the ramp, and\\n\"2 Bear Kicks\" has no effect.\\n Each bear kick ramp shot will display the cumulative number\\nof bear kicks so far and announce the next level to be reached\\nfor an extra ball or mansion room. There is no hint to Super\\nBear Kicks before reaching it on the 96th, 97th, and 98th\\nbear kicks.\\n\\nTHING Bonus\\n\\nMillion Plus ramp shots spot a letter in THING (spelled just\\nbeneath your score on the backglass). On normal settings, you\\nbegin the game with T-H-I already spotted. Complete THING to\\nlight THING Bonus at Thing\\'s Eject (indicated by the yellow\\nlamp). THING Bonus starts at 5M the first time, 10M the second\\ntime, up to a maximum of 15M. T-H-I is only spotted once (if\\nat all). Shooting this award causes Thing to come out of his\\nbox, but the ball is set back down into the eject when the animation\\nfinishes.\\n \"Lite Star\" is lit whenever you shoot the left orbit. It\\nremains lit until either it times out in a few seconds or\\nyou miss the left ramp shot from the upper right flipper.\\nWhen this lamp is lit, the left ramp also lights a Star on\\nthe backglass. You can light up to two stars in this fashion,\\nand when you collect the Thing Bonus, each star is worth 5M.\\nThis value does not increase.\\n On very early prototypes, the yellow lamp above the Thing\\nRamp was also lit to lock balls since there was no green lamp.\\nAlso, early versions carried over the value of the Million\\nPlus ramp from ball to ball by default. Wow!\\n\\nTHING Flips\\n\\nWhenever Thing Flips is lit in the far left inlane, shots to\\nthe bear kick ramp are sent down the left chute to the left\\nmini-flipper. Thing will flip the ball for you; hopefully it\\nshould land in the swamp most of the time. The machine uses\\nartificial intelligence and maintains data from previous flips\\nto determine how it\\'s doing. It tries to maintain a success\\nrate between 40% and 60% (while normal players usually average\\naround a 25% success rate), though on properly maintained machines\\nit can be almost perfect all of the time.\\n The Swamp Millions targets are lit, so if Thing misses you\\nmay be able to pick up some points there. The standard Graveyard\\ntimer is still in effect, so Swamp 5X will remain lit for\\na few seconds on a miss. If Thing misses but hits some swamp\\ntargets, the machine tries to recalculate things for the next\\nflip based on the landing of the shot (high or low).\\n After three complete misses, the machine will throw out\\nall the data and start from scratch. There is also a menu\\noption that will let the operator manually throw out all of\\nthe data.\\n Thing Flips is not lit in the far left inlane during multiball,\\nmultiball restart, or Thing Multiball countdown.\\n\\nMulti-Ball(TM)\\n\\nThe first step in getting to multiball is lighting locks. You\\nlight locks by spelling G-R-E-E-D (hitting the bookcase the\\nappropriate number of times). On your first multiball, the first\\nswitch you trigger each ball spots a letter. You can also gain\\na \"cheat\" GREED letter by tilting. When G-R-E-E-D is spelled,\\nthe bookcase opens and the vault is revealed.\\n If the ball happens to go into the vault while the bookcase\\nis closed, GREED will automatically be spelled, the bookcase\\nwill open instantly, and the first ball is locked. This is\\ncalled a \"dirty pool\". I like it.\\n For the first multiball, Thing\\'s Eject and the Vault will\\nlock your first ball (indicated by the green lamps). Lock\\none ball to serve another to the plunger, unless no balls\\nare in the trough, in which case one will be kicked out from\\nthe Swamp Kickout. You may lock this second ball in Thing\\'s\\nEject, the Vault, or the Swamp. Locking two balls lights both\\nthe Electric Chair and the Vault (the red lamps) to release\\nall balls and begin Multi-Ball, and also turns on the Power\\nmagnets.\\n Once the third ball is locked, all balls will be released.\\nThe first and third balls will come from the Swamp Kickout;\\nthe second will come from either the Electric Chair or the\\nSwamp Kickout, depending on where the last ball was locked.\\n The initial jackpot value is 10M. Shoot the Train Wreck\\ntarget to collect the Jackpot. Shoot the Million Plus Ramp\\nto score the Super Jackpot (for the first multiball, this\\nis a Double Jackpot.) After collecting a Jackpot or Super\\nJackpot, the vault will open; shoot a ball in the vault to\\nrelight the Super Jackpot.\\n During multiball, bookcase hits and center ramp shots add\\n1M to the jackpot, up to its maximum value of 25M. By default\\nthe jackpot value increases until it is awarded, between multiballs\\nand multiball restarts. Once the jackpot is collected, the\\njackpot value resets to 10M. You can continue to collect Super\\nJackpots as long as you can keep two balls in play.\\n If you fail to collect a Jackpot, you can restart multiball\\nby shooting Thing\\'s Eject within 20 seconds. During this time\\nno mansion rooms or stars can be collected, Thing Flips is\\nnot lit, and all center ramp shots will be sent to the right\\nflipper. The Power is not active during multiball restart.\\n Restart is a two-ball multiball, and begins immediately\\nafter plunging the second ball into play. The skill shot here\\ncan set up a pretty easy shot at the Train Wreck target and\\nthe Left Ramp. Both the Jackpot and Super Jackpot are lit\\nafter the restart. However, if you can\\'t hit Thing\\'s Eject,\\nwell, \"sorry old man\", multiball ends. There is only one restart\\nper multiball.\\n Mansion rooms, Stars, Swamp 5X, and Thing Flips cannot be\\ncollected during this and any other multiballs.\\n For the second and subsequent multiballs on normal settings,\\nyou must spell GREED via five bookcase hits, and only the\\nVault will lock balls one and two. The third can be locked\\nin the electric chair or the vault on the second multiball,\\nbut only the Vault will be able to lock ball three to start\\nthe third multiball. Super Jackpot is three times the base\\nJackpot value for all but the first multiball.\\n In a multi-player game, it is possible for one player to\\n\"unlock\" another player\\'s locked balls. For each unlock, the\\nswamp will be lit to relock the ball. This is regardless of\\ndifficulty settings or which level of multiball you are playing.\\nThe ball can be easily locked again just by plunging softly\\nso that the ball falls right into the swamp from the plunger\\nlane; it\\'s a nice fix to the \"stolen balls\" problem common\\nin manual plunger games.\\n\\nMansion Rooms\\n\\nThere are 13 rooms in the Addams\\' mansion that can be collected\\nby shooting either the electric chair or the swamp kickout when\\nthe yellow lamp is lit. The chair is normally lit at the beginning\\nof each ball, and is relit by shooting either the left or center\\nramp.\\n The next mansion room to be awarded will be flashing; rooms\\nthat have already been awarded will be solidly lit. The jet\\nbumpers change the currently flashing room. The last mansion\\nroom, denoted by \"?\", is only available after all of the other\\n12 have been collected.\\n At the beginning of the game, and after the mansion is reset\\nbecause you completed all of the rooms, either \"Mamushka\"\\nor \"Cousin It\" will be the currently flashing room.\\n The total number of mansion rooms collected over the course\\nof the game is counted and contributes to your end of ball\\nbonus. Unlike Bear Kicks, you start the game with zero mansion\\nrooms.\\n Mansion rooms can also be spotted (i.e. awarded for free)\\nby hitting the bear kick ramp enough times; see \"Bear Kicks\".\\n When the twelve rooms have been collected, the Question\\nMark is lit in the Attic. Collecting the \"?\" starts \"Tour\\nthe Mansion\" (see below). You do not have to relight the electric\\nchair/swamp kickout via the ramps or the right inlane in order\\nto collect this award. You can\\'t spot \"?\" via Bear Kicks;\\nsurpassing a level that would normally award a mansion room\\njust wastes that opportunity whenever \"?\" is the only room\\nleft.\\n Each mansion room is described in more detail below.\\n\\nMansion: 3 Million\\nAwards 3 million, and on normal settings, spots the 6M mansion\\nroom if it has not yet been collected. For the purposes of end-of-ball\\nbonus, the spotting of the 6M panel by this award is not considered\\nto be an earned mansion room.\\n In \"The Addams\\' Family Gold Edition\", this panel has been\\nreplaced by Pugsley and Wednesday\\'s Trap Door. See the section\\ncalled Metacommentary for more information about TAF\\nGold.\\n\\nMansion: Graveyard at Max\\n Advances all jet bumpers to flashing status; each jet now\\nadvances the Graveyard value by 30K until the end of the current\\nball. At the beginning of the next ball, all jet bumpers will\\nreturn to unlit status.\\n I\\'m not sure if this award affects the Grave targets at\\nall, but the normal way to advance jet bumpers is by hitting\\nGrave targets.\\n\\nMansion: Hit Cousin It\\nThis is a 20 second timed round, during which all targets score\\n200K. Each hit to Cousin It, however, increases the target value\\nby 50K, and scores 2M points.\\n The timer used in this and all other timed rounds will stop\\nwhenever any ball in play is in an eject or a tunnel. This\\nmeans that rounds which continue into regular multiball tend\\nto last a lot longer than 20 or even 30 seconds. It will also\\nstop temporarily during a ball search but then restarts again.\\n Also, the target value is scored for every switch tripped,\\nso the ramps and sinkhole shots will always trip more than\\none switch.\\n Your Cousin It bonus is initially credited with 1M points\\nat the start of the round.\\n\\nMansion: The\\nMamushka\\nThis is a 20 second timed round during\\nwhich all targets score 250K. There is no way to increase the\\ntarget value.\\n Your Mamushka bonus is initially credited with 1M points\\nat the start of the round.\\n\\nMansion: 6 Million\\nAwards 6 million points. On normal difficulty settings, it also\\nspots the 3M mansion room if it has not yet been awarded.\\n\\nMansion: Quick Multiball\\nLights Quick Multiball at Thing\\'s Eject. This remains lit until\\nit is collected (by default). You cannot lock balls at Thing\\'s\\nEject or collect the Thing Bonus while it is lit. It becomes\\nunavailable temporarily during any multiball or multiball restart.\\n Shoot Thing\\'s Eject to begin. Thing will take the ball and\\nsend it to the swamp kickout; another ball will be served\\nto the plunger unless two balls have been locked, in which\\ncase it will come from the Swamp Kickout. During Quick Multiball,\\nthe Vault will be open and will score 5M points. This value\\nincreases by 1M each time \"Vault Millions\" is collected or\\nthe center ramp is hit, up to a maximum value of 10M.\\n There may be some problems with this round or Thing Multiball\\nwhenever Tunnel Hunt is running; see \"Mansion: Tunnel Hunt\".\\n If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball\\nis lit, Thing Multiball only will be started instead.\\n\\nMansion: Tunnel Hunt\\nThis is a 20 second timed round in which you should shoot the\\nthree tunnel shots: the electric chair, the swamp (or swamp\\nkickout), and the vault. They may be shot in any order. The\\nfirst scores 5M, the second is worth 10M, and the third is worth\\n15M.\\n The round starts with the quote \"Look darling, just what\\nwe\\'ve been searching for\" by Morticia. The quotes for each\\ntunnel searched are: 1st tunnel: \"Perhaps it\\'s in here.\"\\n 2nd tunnel: \"There it is.\"\\n 3rd tunnel: \"Just what we\\'ve been searching for.\"\\n If the electric chair is lit, hitting the electric chair\\nduring Tunnel Hunt will also award another mansion room. (Same\\ngoes for the swamp kickout.)\\n If the vault was previously lit for lock, you will not be\\nable to lock balls during Tunnel Hunt. It will relight at\\nthe end of the round. Once the vault has been hit, it will\\nclose. If Quick Multiball or Thing Multiball is running, it\\nmay or may not close (hopefully it won\\'t, of course).\\n Plunging a ball into the swamp while Tunnel Hunt is running\\ndoes not give credit for the tunnel. Hitting the bookcase\\nduring Tunnel Hunt when the vault should be open will not\\nconvince the game to open it.\\n\\nMansion: Seance\\nThis is a 20 second timed round during which the next three\\nramp shots (either Million Plus or Bear Kick ramp) will score\\n5M, 10M, and 15M each. The Power magnets are enabled throughout\\nthe round.\\n The round starts with Gomez saying \"Seance ... knock three\\ntimes.\" Successive ramp shots will then producing one, two,\\nor three knocking sounds followed by Gomez saying \"Once\",\\n\"Twice\", or \"Thrice ... well done.\"\\n Bear Kick ramps will always feed to Thing\\'s mini-flipper,\\nexcept when Thing Multiball is counting down. Thing Flips\\nis still possible during Seance.\\n\\n\\nMansion:\\n9 Million\\nAwards 9 million points. Wow.\\n\\nMansion: Thing\\nMultiball\\nMuch like Quick Multiball, this is a count-down\\naward lit at Thing\\'s Eject. Hitting this immediately scores\\n15M, but this value counts down quickly to 3M before it expires.\\nThere is a short grace period once the timer reaches 3M. Shoot\\nThing\\'s Eject to score the value immediately and set the value\\nof the vault during Thing Multiball. During the countdown, *all*\\nbear kick shots will return the ball to the right inlane, no\\nmatter what. Thing Flips inlane is not lit during the countdown\\nor the actual multiball.\\n A second ball is sent to the plunger if possible (see \"Quick\\nMultiball\" for details if this is not the case), and multi-ball\\nplay begins as soon as it is plunged, in the same manner as\\nQuick Multiball. However, the value of the vault is fixed\\nand cannot be increased.\\n If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball\\nis lit, Thing Multiball will be started instead, and Quick\\nMultiball cannot be collected until Thing Multiball ends.\\n If you have spotted Thing Multiball by bear kicks, you can\\nshoot Thing before the mansion fanfare finishes. However,\\nyou will NOT be awarded the instant 15M points. The vault\\nvalue is still fixed to 15M and an otherwise normal Thing\\nMultiball continues.\\n\\nMansion: Raise the Dead\\nThis award starts a 30 second timed round in which hits to the\\njet bumpers add to your Raise the Dead bonus. The bumpers will\\nall flash, even though this award has nothing to do with the\\nnormal status of the jets (unlit, lit, and flashing). Shoot\\neach bumper four times to score 3M points; each bumper hit is\\nalso worth 100K also. The Raise the Dead bonus begins at 2M.\\n Whenever one of the bumpers is hit for the fourth time,\\nit becomes solidly lit. The dot matrix will show you a grave\\nfor each of the bumpers and how many more times each bumper\\nneeds to be hit.\\n When all bumpers have been hit four times, the round ends\\nimmediately. You can, however, continue to collect 100K per\\nhit for bumpers which have already been hit four times until\\nthe round is over.\\n\\nMansion: Extra Ball\\nThis mansion room simply lights an Extra Ball at Thing\\'s Eject.\\nUnder normal settings, it will remain lit until collected.\\n\\nTour the Mansion\\n\\nWhenever the 12th mansion award has been collected or started,\\nthe electric chair will be re-lit automatically and the \"?\"\\nwill be flashing. Shooting the chair (or swamp kickout, of course)\\nwill start \"Tour the Mansion\", which is as follows:\\n All of the mansion rooms become unlit. Basically, Tour the\\nMansion has a lot in common with Whirlwind in that the mega-award\\nis simply to re-award everything (almost everything, actually).\\n 50 million points is awarded (as clearly indicated by Gomez).\\nThe 3M, 6M, and 9M rooms light up at this point.\\n \"Special\" is lit in the outlanes. By default, these outlanes\\nare \"hard\", meaning that only one of them is lit at a time,\\nchanging whenever a slingshot is hit. Quick Multiball lights\\nup now, even though it has nothing to do with Specials.\\n The Graveyard is maximized (all jet bumpers flash). The\\ncorresponding room is lit.\\n An extra ball is lit at Thing\\'s Eject, and the EB room is\\nlit. This is a temporary extra ball, which must be collected\\nbefore you drain or it will go away.\\n Each of the remaining room rounds is started one at a time,\\nin the following order: Mamushka, Hit Cousin It, Seance, Tunnel\\nHunt, Raise the Dead, and Thing Multiball. The first five\\nare all timed and end as soon as the timer expires or you\\ndrain. Thing Multiball ends if you fail to start the round\\n(as usual by shooting Thing\\'s Eject), or if you do start two-ball\\nplay, when you return to one ball.\\n Any rounds running when the Tour is started continue to\\nrun during the Tour. It is extremely distressing if you have\\nto contend with the Power during the Tour because you had\\nstarted the Seance round before starting the Tour.\\n If you reach a number of bear kicks that would ordinarily\\nspot a mansion room while Touring, that free room is wasted.\\nIt does not carry over to the next mansion, nor does it affect\\nTour the Mansion in any way.\\n If you complete all of the above, the Tour ends quietly.\\nFor the remainder of that ball, you will be unable to collect\\nmansion awards.\\n The extra ball lit by Touring is \"hard\" by default; it must\\nbe collected on that ball or it will disappear. Likewise,\\n\"Special\" will also be unavailable after the ball ends.\\n Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead bonuses collected\\nbefore Touring carry over into the Tour, i.e. your base totals\\nfor the round are what you had before you toured, plus the\\n1M or 2M normally given for starting the round.\\n Previous versions of this guide said that \"?\" isn\\'t really\\nconsidered a mansion room since it isn\\'t added to the count\\nas part of your end- of-ball bonus. This is wrong: starting\\nTour the Mansion awards one mansion room just like all of\\nthe other rooms. Each mansion round played during Tour the\\nMansion, however, has no effect on this counter.\\n\\nEnd of Ball Bonus\\n\\nBonus is calculated at the end of each ball as follows: 100K\\nfor each bear kick, up to the maximum 99.\\n 500K for each mansion room, with no apparent limit. The\\ndisplay has trouble with values over 99, though.\\n The sum of the above is multiplied by the bonus multiplier,\\nfrom 1x to 5x.\\n Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead totals are added.\\n Scoring 20M or more in bonus generates a quote from Gomez:\\n\"Who says you can\\'t take it with you?\" However, the quote\\nwill not be delivered unless you played at least one of the\\ntimed rounds during the ball.\\n\\nCombos\\n\\nThere are two 3-way combos, worth 5M each:\\n Right inlane, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp\\n Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp, Swamp\\n And one 4-way combo, worth 10M:\\n Bear kick ramp, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus ramp, Swamp\\n Scoring the 4-way combo also awards the points for the 3-way\\ncombo (since the first 3 of the 4 forms one of the 3-way combos).\\nThis makes the 4-way very valuable: 15M + bonus X advanced\\n+ at least 1M from the ramp + at least 5M for the 5X graveyard\\nvalue + 5M for the Star when you collect Thing Bonus.\\n\\nDefaults\\n\\nThe following information was taken from The Addams Family manual,\\ncourtesy of Jonathan Deitch (musjndx@gsusgi2.gsu.edu). It is\\na list of game features that can be altered by the operator.\\nNormally these are left alone, but adjusting the overall difficulty\\nof the machine or setting games to 5-balls will change a lot\\nof these.\\n 1. Extra Ball Percent: desired % of games in which the first\\nBear Kick extra ball should be collected. This value is used\\ninternally to reflex the number of bear kicks required. Range\\nis 15-40% It can also be set to FIXED such that the first\\nbear kick extra ball level does not reflex. Default is 25%.\\n 2. 1st Bear Kick extra ball level: set 1. to fixed and this\\noption will set the number of bear kicks required for the\\nfirst extra ball. Default is 8.\\n 3. 2nd Bear Kick extra ball level: This value ranges from\\n30-99 and does not reflex. Default is 50.\\n 4. Train Wreck Extra Ball Available: Default is to award\\nextra balls at a certain number of train wrecks.\\n 5. Bear Kick EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\\n 6. House EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\\n 7. Train Wreck EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\\n 8. Last Thing Lock: This is the final multiball level on\\nwhich Thing will lock balls. Default is for the first multiball\\nonly. This value ranges from 0-5.\\n 9. Last Swamp Lock: This is the final multiball level on\\nwhich the Swamp will light to lock ball two. Default is for\\nthe first multiball only. The value ranges from 1-5.\\n 10. Last Chair Release: This is the final multiball level\\non which the electric chair can be shot to start multiball.\\nDefault is for the first and second multiballs. The value\\nranges from 0-5.\\n 11. Jackpot Carryover: When set this retains the value of\\nthe jackpot until it is hit; when off, the jackpot will reset\\nat the end of each multiball or multiball restart. Default\\nis to carryover jackpots.\\n 12. Million Plus Memory: Default is to reset the value of\\nthe Million Plus at the end of each ball. Change this and\\nscoring would become atrocious.\\n 13. Million Plus Maximum: Default upper limit of the Million\\nPlus is 10M. This value can range from 5M to 20M.\\n 14. Thing Multiball Start: This value can range from 10M\\nto 20M. Default starting value of Thing Multiball is 15M.\\n 15. Room from Swamp: Default is to award mansion rooms from\\nthe swamp kickout.\\n 16. Free THING Letters: Up to 5 THING letters can be spotted\\nat the beginning of the game. Default is 3.\\n 17. Raise the Dead Hits: The number of hits per jet bumper\\ncan be set from 3-9. Default is 4.\\n 18. Train Wreck Hits: By default, 2 hits are required for\\nthe first Train Wreck. This value can range from 2-4. Successive\\ntrain wrecks always require 1 more hit up to the maximum of\\n6.\\n 19. Special Memory: By default, specials disappear at the\\nend of the current ball.\\n 20. Train Wreck Memory: By default, the train wreck hits\\ncount carries over between balls.\\n 21. Quick Multiball Memory: By default, Quick Multiball\\nwill remain lit between balls until it is hit.\\n 22. Tour EB Memory: By default, the Extra Ball lit during\\nTour the Mansion will disappear at the end of the current\\nball.\\n 23. Tour Difficulty. Default is a medium setting, in which\\nthe 6M and 3M rooms will spot each other. On the hard setting,\\neach must be collected separately.\\n\\nProblems\\n\\nWhile this game is perfect in many ways, none is completely\\nimmune to problems or failures. Here are some of the more common\\nproblems:\\n Balls can get stuck inside the swamp, on the swamp, on top\\nof Thing\\'s box, on jet bumpers, and on the circular plate\\nthat the bookcase sits upon. The machine will perform ball\\nsearches until it finds the missing ball -- firing all the\\njet bumpers, spinning the vault, etc. *but* it will not fire\\nthe swamp kickout if a ball has been locked there at first.\\nEventually, if the ball has not been found, it will serve\\na new ball in the plunger lane, or if no balls are in the\\ntrough, it will try to fire one from the swamp kickout.\\n If you tilt, it will end the current ball, but the next\\nball won\\'t start until it finds the missing ball(s). The only\\nsolution short of removing the stuck ball at this point is\\nto power cycle the game and start over unless you have locked\\nballs; it will kick out ALL locked balls after two or three\\nball searches. However, once these drain, if the ball is still\\nlost the problem can easily resurface.\\n If you abort the game and start a new one, when pressing\\nStart the game will let you know if a pinball is missing and\\ntry to find it a couple of times, but eventually it will give\\nup and play with what\\'s available. There are only three balls\\ninstalled in the machine; it will function even if only one\\nis available (though obviously multiball loses its meaning\\n:-)\\n The only diverter is located in the upper left corner where\\nthe two ramps meet. If it gets stuck, you may find all balls\\ngoing to the same spot -- either the mini-flipper or the right\\ninlane. This may or may not be a \"problem\". I\\'ve also heard\\nof balls getting lodged back there somehow.\\n If the machine decides that there are faulty switches (because\\nthey haven\\'t been hit in a while), it will try to compensate.\\nIf one of the ramp switches is bad, the other ramp will award\\nboth of them. If the bookcase won\\'t open, you can lock balls\\nat the Thing Ramp. If Thing can\\'t pick up the ball from the\\neject, then it will just remain there. I\\'m sure that there\\nare many more that I haven\\'t seen.\\n\\nQuotes\\n\\nSomeone has already taken care of this for me. A list of all\\nthe quotes is currently available from the r.g.p. FTP archive\\non pinball.cc.cmu.edu,\\nas /Quotes/taf.quotes\\n\\nMusic\\n\\nThe following is a list of the musical pieces in The Addams\\nFamily:\\n Addams Theme: Played at the beginning of your first ball\\nuntil you plunge the ball into play. Also played during attract\\nmode and the explanation of \"Tour the Mansion.\"\\n Normal Game Theme: Played during normal game play, when\\nno special rounds are active.\\n Mamushka Theme: Played during the Mamushka round.\\n Cousin It Theme: Played during Cousin It round.\\n Tunnel Hunt Theme: Played during Tunnel Hunt round.\\n Seance Theme: Hardly music, but played during Seance round.\\n Raise the Dead Theme: Played during Raise the Dead round.\\n Thing Multiball Countdown Theme\\n Quick/Thing Multiball Theme: Played during quick MB rounds.\\n Multiball Release Theme: Played while two balls are locked\\nand you\\'re trying to lock the third for Multiball.\\n Multiball Theme: Played until you score your first jackpot.\\n Jackpot Theme: Played after you score a jackpot UNTIL YOU\\nEND THAT BALL, even after multiball is over, or until you\\nstart multiball again. It\\'s a souped-up version of the Addams\\nTheme.\\n It\\'s also the Enter Initials Theme.\\n Multiball Restart Theme: Played while Thing Multiball restart\\nis lit, it\\'s just one particular part of the Addams Theme\\nbeing played over and over. The same music is also played\\nwhile the features of \"Tour the Mansion\" are being explained.\\n\\nCows\\n\\nLike most Bally/Williams pinballs, there are cows in this game\\n(or at least images of them). During attract mode, there is\\na sequence of flipper button/start presses that will cause the\\ncows to come up during attract mode. There is also a sequence\\nthat causes the game\\'s credits to appear with rather loud accompaniment.\\n Using the notation L=left flipper, R=right flipper, and\\nS=start button:\\n Cows: 7L, 1S, 14R, 1S, 20L, 1S\\n Credits: 13L, 1S, 1R, 1S, 2L, 1S\\n These sequences only work for L-1 machines and later, and\\nsometimes you may have to power cycle the game to get it to\\nwork. Also, there can\\'t be any credits on the game at the\\ntime, since hitting the start button would thus begin a game.\\n\\nMetacommentary\\n\\nThe Addams Family was released in 1991, and\\nwas designed by Pat Lawlor, creator of Whirlwind, Funhouse,\\nand later, Twilight Zone and Road Show. It was, of course, inspired\\nby the television series of the same name. Since then, it has\\nbecome the number one selling pinball of all time, surpassing\\nsuch classics as \"Eight Ball Deluxe\".\\n To commemorate this noteworthy accomplishment, in the spring\\nof 1994 TAF was placed back onto the production line -- 2500\\n\"Gold Edition\" machines were made, mostly for collectors and\\nnot distribution. There are differences between the new TAF\\nGold and the original, such as:\\n Gold-colored lockdown bars, jet bumper caps, vaults, and\\nThing boxes.\\n More quotes have been added; none have been removed.\\n A new game feature called \"Cousin It\\'s Lost items\". Some\\nof the mansion rooms contain hats, hairbrushes, keys, etc.\\nworth bonus points and even extra balls and specials.\\n The 3M mansion room has been replaced by \"Pugsley and Wednesday\\'s\\nTrap Door\". It scores 3M but serves as a link to another one\\nof the mansion rooms. Because of this, it does not automatically\\nspot the 6M mansion room anymore.\\n For more detailed information on TAF Gold,\\nsee Keith Johnson\\'s rulesheet.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis \"Addams Family\" guide has been brought to you by Brian\\nDominy (gt6139a@prism.gatech.edu) but with the help of many\\nothers. Thanks to Kevin Martin, Jonathan Deitch, David Hammett,\\nDavid Stewart, Mark Cook, Keith Johnson, Tom Capek, Brian Toothman,\\nand all others who have contributed in one way or another.

Gottlieb & Co. in 1971.\\nMore information is available from the\\nInternet Pinball Database.\\n\\nGAME ELEMENTS\\n\\nThe 4 Square playfield includes two sets of targets and three sets\\nof rollovers, with each set consisting of four items.  Each item\\nin a given set has a corresponding indicator light marked with a\\nunique number value: 1, 2, 3, or  4.  The upper central area of the\\nplayfield also contains three pop bumpers arranged in a triangle\\nconfiguration.  There are also two kicking rubber islands located\\nalong each side just above the flippers.  The lower central portion\\nof the playfield is wide open and contains four rows of sequence\\nindicator lights, with each row consisting of 4 lights numbered\\nfrom 1 to 4.\\n\\nSCORING\\n\\nAll rollovers and targets score 50 points.  During the game, certain\\nsets of targets and rollovers may be increased in value to score\\n200 points instead of 50 points, as explained below.  Rollover and\\ntarget scoring occurs whether the item is lit or not.  The two\\nkicking rubbers score 1 point.  The left and right pop bumpers score\\n1 point when unlit and 10 points when lit.  The central pop bumper\\nscores 10 points when unlit and 100 points when lit.  The three\\nbumpers are never all lit at the same time.  The bumpers alternate\\nbetween having both 10 point bumpers lit and the 100 point bumper\\nout, or the 100 point bumper lit and both 10 point bumpers out.\\nThis alternation occurs when 1 point is scored.  Therefore, the\\nbumpers will alternate when either kicking rubber is hit or when\\neither 10 point bumper is hit when not lit.  Note, however, that\\nonce the 10 point bumpers are lit all three bumpers are scoring 10\\npoints so none of the bumpers can cause the lights to alternate\\nagain.  In this situation, the player must hit a kicking rubber to\\nget the bumper lights to switch back so that the 100 point bumper\\nlights up and the 10 point bumpers go out.\\n\\nSEQUENCE FEATURE\\n\\nAt the start of a game, all sequence indicator lights are out and\\nall target and rollover indicator lights are lit.  The basic idea\\nof the game is to complete as many sequences as possible (starting\\nwith the first sequence) by hitting the 1, 2, 3 and 4 targets or\\nrollovers.  When any lit target or rollover is made, the indicators\\nof all like-numbered items go out and the corresponding number is\\nspotted (lit) in the row of the first sequence.  Numbers can be\\nmade in any order.   When all four numbers in the first sequence\\nare made, 500 points are scored and all targets and rollovers reset,\\nlighting up again.   This same action is repeated to complete the\\nsecond, third, and fourth sequences in order, with a 500 point bonus\\nbeing scored each time a sequence is completed.  Once the fourth\\nsequence is completed, the targets and rollovers do not reset - in\\nother words, they do not light up again.  However, they do continue\\nto register their current score value.\\n\\nFEATURE SCORE INCREASE AND SPECIAL SCORING\\n\\nAfter the first sequence is completed, the top rollovers score 200\\npoints.  After the second sequence is completed, the yellow targets\\nin the upper area of the playfield score 200 points.  After the\\nthird sequence is completed, the green targets in the lower area\\nof the playfield score 200 points.  After the fourth sequence is\\ncompleted, the green targets light occasionally for special.  The\\nspecials for all four green targets light up together and go out\\ntogether.  They light whenever the 100 point bumper is lit.  In\\nother words, they are tied to the same alternator sequence as\\ndescribed for the bumpers.  As explained above, this means that the\\nonly way to light the specials (if they are out) is to bounce the\\nball off one of the kicking rubbers.  Hitting any green target when\\nlit for special scores a special only (no score).  Each special\\nawards one free game (replay).\\n\\nREPLAYS FOR HIGH SCORES\\n\\nOne replay is scored for achieving the each of the following high\\nscores: 5100; 6300; 7500; 8700.\\n\\nTILT\\n\\nA tilt ends the game and causes ALL playfield lamps to go out.\\n\\nMAXIMUM CREDITS\\n\\nAll Gottlieb wedgeheads were factory-set to allow a maximum of 15\\ncredits to be registered on the replay unit.  While this could be\\nadjusted by the operator, it was extremely rare for anyone to change\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nback to Rule Sheets\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'pinball_title': '4 Square', 'manufacturer': 'D.

You can send\\ne-mail to gt6139a@prism.gatech.edu\\nCredit to those people who have contributed in some way to\\nthis guide appears at the end.\\n These rules describe play on normal default settings and\\non machines without broken diverters or faulty switches. See\\nthe section on \"Defaults\" for a listing of defaults and operator-settable\\noptions. See your operator if anything\\'s broken :-)\\n This is a special version of this rulesheet formatted especially\\nfor the World Wide Web.

Insert coins into the machine\\nto accumulate credits. The display will show the number of credits\\nyou\\'ve put on the game. Press Start once for each player in\\nthe game; you may play up to four players at once, and you may\\nadd players until the beginning of ball 2. Do not press Start\\nthereafter until all players have finished their games; otherwise,\\nall players\\' games will be aborted and a new, one-player game\\nwill start.\\n On the newer Addams Family Gold Edition,\\nyou may buy an extra ball at the end of the game for 1 credit.\\nAll game features and scores resume as they were at the end\\nof the game.\\n\\nGeneral Playfield Description and Basic Rules\\n\\nThis section contains the basic game rules, shot by shot. Specific\\nrules about timed rounds, multiball, and other major game features\\nwill come later.\\n\\nMillion Plus\\nRamp (Side Ramp):\\nEach left ramp shot scores 1M, 2M, 3M,\\netc. up to a maximum of 10M*; this value resets at the beginning\\nof each ball. Each shot also lights a letter in THING if THING\\nhas not yet been completed, spots the first unlit GRAVE target,\\nlights the electric chair, and feeds the ball (with a properly\\nworking diverter) to Thing\\'s Flipper. This ramp is also used\\nto collect Stars when lit via the left loop, and to score Super\\nJackpots during multiball. This ramp has a gate which scores\\n5130 points in both directions and loudly fires the ramp diverter.\\n\\nBear Kick Ramp\\n(Center Ramp):\\nEach center ramp shot awards 1 Bear Kick\\n(2 when lit via the near left inlane), lights the Electric Chair\\nif it is not lit, and returns the ball down the right inlane.\\nWhen Thing Flips is lit, it sends the ball to Thing\\'s flipper\\ninstead. Extra balls and free mansion rooms are awarded at various\\nnumbers of bear kicks. This ramp has a gate which scores 5130\\npoints in both directions. It is also the \"V\" grave target.\\nSee \"Bear Kicks\".\\n\\nElectric Chair\\n(Left Sinkhole/Kickout):\\nLocated just above the left flipper. When\\nthe yellow lamp is lit, it awards the currently flashing Mansion\\nRoom and kicks the ball back out, hopefully to the left flipper.\\nWhen the red lamp is lit, it begins Multi-Ball(TM). The right\\ninlane lights the chair for a mansion room temporarily; either\\nthe center ramp or the left ramp lights it permanently. On normal\\nsettings, the Electric Chair is lit at the beginning of each\\nball. (Note: for the remainder of the rules sheet, to say that\\nthe \"electric chair is lit\" means that the yellow lamp above\\nthe electric chair is lit.)\\n\\nSwamp Kickout\\n(Right Sinkhole/Kickout):\\nAwards mansion rooms whenever the Electric\\nChair ordinarily would (i.e. the yellow lamp is lit). Kicks\\nthe ball back out, hopefully to the right flipper. This shot\\nis also the \"E\" target in GRAVE. Shots to the vault, Thing\\'s\\nbox, and the swamp are fed here.\\n\\nSwamp (Side\\nWide Sinkhole):\\nLocated along the right side of the playfield,\\njust below the upper right flipper. Scores the Graveyard Value\\nduring normal play, or five times the Graveyard Value when lit\\nby sending the ball through the opto just below the mini-flipper.\\nThe swamp locks balls when lit. Balls exit the swamp through\\nthe swamp kickout.\\n\\nTrain Wreck\\nTarget (Back Left Corner Target):\\nThis shot is most easily made from the\\nupper right flipper. Located to the right of the Million Plus\\nRamp, it scores 1M ordinarily; at certain levels, it scores\\n5M and a \"Train Wreck\". Each Train Wreck prevents the Graveyard\\nValue from resetting at the beginning of the next ball. On normal\\nsettings, four Train Wrecks lights an extra ball. The first\\nTrain Wreck takes 2 hits; the second takes 3 hits; and so on\\nup to a maximum of 6 hits per train wreck.\\n\\nGraveyard Jet Bumpers:\\nAdvances the Graveyard Value by 10K for unlit bumpers, 20K for\\nlit bumpers, and 30K for flashing bumpers. Bumpers are advanced\\nby any of the unlit GRAVE targets (see below). The Graveyard\\nvalue is initially 1M at the beginning of each ball (unless\\nit has been held by a Train Wreck), and increases to a maximum\\nof 4M. Each jet bumper hit also changes the currently flashing\\nmansion room, moving from left to right first, then bottom to\\ntop.\\n\\nGRAVE targets:\\nThe two targets \"G\" and \"R\" are located\\njust beneath the jet bumpers. \"A\" is to the left of the Bear\\nKicks Ramp. \"V\" is not a standup target but instead is the center\\nramp. Likewise, \"E\" is the swamp kickout entrance. Complete\\nGRAVE to score the GRAVE bonus of 2M, 3M, 4M, etc. to a maximum\\nof 10M for the duration of the game. Each unlit GRAVE target\\nalso advances a jet bumper. Any shot to the Million Plus ramp\\nwill spot the first unlit GRAVE target.\\n\\nCousin It (Standup Targets):\\nFour standup targets above the Electric Chair most easily hit\\nby the upper right flipper, though it can be hit from the lower\\nright as well (think Superdog targets from Funhouse); it ordinarily\\njust produces a sound effect, \"It, old man!\", and scores 250K\\npoints. It is used mainly in the Cousin It round.\\n\\nBookcase/Vault (Target/Sinkhole):\\nThe bookcase is a large target to the right of the bear kicks\\nramp. Each bookcase hit spots a letter in GREED; spell GREED\\nto open the vault (a sinkhole behind the bookcase). During multiball\\nit also adds to the jackpot value. The vault is used to lock\\nballs, start Multi-Ball(TM), score Quick Multiball jackpots,\\nand relight the Super Jackpot. Two lamps are above the vault\\n-- the red lamp is lit whenever multiball start or quick multiball\\njackpots are lit; the green lamp is lit whenever the vault is\\nopen to lock a ball.\\n\\nThing Ramp: \\nThis is a small metal ramp to the left of the Bear Kicks ramp\\nthat feeds the ball to Thing\\'s Eject. There are two lamps above\\nthis ramp -- the green lamp indicates that a shot here will\\nlock the ball, and the yellow lamp means that \"Thing Bonus\"\\nis lit. Thing ramp shots also starts Quick Multiball and Thing\\nMultiball, and is lit to collect extra balls.\\n\\nThing\\'s Eject:\\nThis eject is used to score the Skill Shot, and when lit starts\\nQuick Multiball or Thing Multiball, restarts Multi-Ball(TM),\\nlocks balls, awards THING bonus, or awards extra balls. It is\\nusually made during game play by shooting the Thing ramp (see\\nabove), but all Thing awards except the skill shot can be collected\\nfrom either.\\n\\nThing (Gimmick Hand):\\nYes, Thing himself! He resides in a box and occasionally comes\\nout to pick up a ball in Thing\\'s Eject, using a magnet. When\\nhe does, the ball is either carried away to the swamp, or Thing\\nreappears and releases the ball in the eject.\\n\\nAdv X Lane\\n(Left Loop):\\nThis is a lane that runs from the back\\nof the jet bumpers around the machine to the upper right flipper.\\nWhen \"Adv X\" is lit via the right inlane, shooting this lane\\nin either direction advances the bonus multiplier from 1 to\\na maximum of 5, valid only for the current ball. Regardless,\\nshooting the lane through the bumpers to the upper right flipper\\nlights \"Lite Star\" on the Million Plus Ramp. This shot is part\\nof all combos. The lit \"Adv X\" times out in a few seconds.\\n\\nThe Power:\\nThe infamous magnets beneath the playfield.\\nTwo distinctive Williams lightning bolts in the middle of the\\nplayfield and two bright side flashers start up when the Power\\nis active. The Power wreaks havoc during the Seance round, when\\nMansion Multiball is lit, and during Mansion Multiball.\\n\\nNear Left Inlane: \\nLights \"2 Bear Kicks\" on the center ramp. This award times out\\nin a few seconds. It is always lit.\\n\\nFar Left Inlane: \\nLights \"Thing Flips\" on the center ramp when lit; a center ramp\\nshot will then be diverted to Thing\\'s flipper for an automatic\\nflip towards the swamp. The ramp times out in a few seconds.\\nThe inlane is not always lit; see \"Thing Flips\" for more details.\\n\\nRight Inlane: \\nAlways lights \"Adv X\" lane for a few seconds, and if the Electric\\nChair is unlit, lights it temporarily for a few seconds.\\n\\nSwamp Millions Targets: \\nWhenever 5X Graveyard is lit, these targets award 1M points\\neach. There are three targets, two below and one just above\\nthe entrance to the swamp. These targets time out just as 5X\\nGraveyard does, and can be hit multiple times until it does.\\nThey also help Thing determine how well he\\'s autoflipping.\\n\\nLeft/Right\\nOutlanes:\\nWhen lit they score \"Special\" (on normal\\nsettings, this is a replay). \"Special\" can only be lit by Touring\\nthe Mansion, and normally only one outlane is lit at a time.\\n\\nSkill Shot\\n\\nEach time a ball is placed in the plunger lane, you have a chance\\nto score the \"Skill Shot\". Hit the ball into Thing\\'s eject for\\n2M the first time, then 3M, then 4M, and finally a maximum of\\n5M. These values increase for the duration of the game. Balls\\nwhich do not land in the eject may circle around into the Jet\\nBumpers on a hard shot, miss the eject but still land in that\\narea on a close shot, or fall into the swamp on a soft shot.\\nIf the ball misses the eject but does not touch any playfield\\nswitch, you may safely let it drain and get the ball back. In\\nother words, you cannot score zero points on a ball (without\\ntilting). The switch in the plunger lane near the swamp and\\nthe one just above the plunger do not count since they score\\nno points.\\n\\nBear Kicks\\n\\nThe number of Bear Kicks accumulates throughout the game. You\\nbegin with 1 Bear Kick; each center ramp adds 1 to this value,\\nor 2 when the \"2 Bear Kicks\" light has been lit via the near\\nleft inlane.\\n At a certain level of bear kicks, an extra ball will be\\nlit at Thing\\'s Eject. This value normally reflexes according\\nto recent game play, but it is usually around 8 or 9. It is\\nno less than 6 bear kicks, but apparently it has no maximum.\\n At 15, 25, 35, and 45 bear kicks, mansion rooms are spotted.\\nThe currently flashing mansion room will be awarded as if\\nyou had hit the electric chair or the swamp kickout, and happens\\neven if the electric chair is not lit. Mansion rooms are not\\nspotted during any of the multiballs; when the multiball finishes,\\none more center ramp shot will spot the room. (I\\'m not sure\\nif you can stack mansion spots or not.) If you shoot the lit\\nelectric chair or swamp kickout before the room is spotted,\\nthat room will be announced before the one that was spotted.\\nThe \"?\" panel cannot be spotted by bear kicks.\\n Another extra ball is available at 50 bear kicks. This value\\ndoes not reflex according to game play, but may be manually\\nadjusted by the operator.\\n Mansion rooms are also spotted at 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95\\nbear kicks.\\n On the 99th bear kick, and every bear kick after that, a\\n\"Super Bear Kick\" is scored. This is just 5M points, a neat\\nanimation showing \"Super Bear Bonus\", and a few booms off\\nthe sound board. At this point, no more mansion rooms can\\nbe spotted, no more extra balls can be lit via the ramp, and\\n\"2 Bear Kicks\" has no effect.\\n Each bear kick ramp shot will display the cumulative number\\nof bear kicks so far and announce the next level to be reached\\nfor an extra ball or mansion room. There is no hint to Super\\nBear Kicks before reaching it on the 96th, 97th, and 98th\\nbear kicks.\\n\\nTHING Bonus\\n\\nMillion Plus ramp shots spot a letter in THING (spelled just\\nbeneath your score on the backglass). On normal settings, you\\nbegin the game with T-H-I already spotted. Complete THING to\\nlight THING Bonus at Thing\\'s Eject (indicated by the yellow\\nlamp). THING Bonus starts at 5M the first time, 10M the second\\ntime, up to a maximum of 15M. T-H-I is only spotted once (if\\nat all). Shooting this award causes Thing to come out of his\\nbox, but the ball is set back down into the eject when the animation\\nfinishes.\\n \"Lite Star\" is lit whenever you shoot the left orbit. It\\nremains lit until either it times out in a few seconds or\\nyou miss the left ramp shot from the upper right flipper.\\nWhen this lamp is lit, the left ramp also lights a Star on\\nthe backglass. You can light up to two stars in this fashion,\\nand when you collect the Thing Bonus, each star is worth 5M.\\nThis value does not increase.\\n On very early prototypes, the yellow lamp above the Thing\\nRamp was also lit to lock balls since there was no green lamp.\\nAlso, early versions carried over the value of the Million\\nPlus ramp from ball to ball by default. Wow!\\n\\nTHING Flips\\n\\nWhenever Thing Flips is lit in the far left inlane, shots to\\nthe bear kick ramp are sent down the left chute to the left\\nmini-flipper. Thing will flip the ball for you; hopefully it\\nshould land in the swamp most of the time. The machine uses\\nartificial intelligence and maintains data from previous flips\\nto determine how it\\'s doing. It tries to maintain a success\\nrate between 40% and 60% (while normal players usually average\\naround a 25% success rate), though on properly maintained machines\\nit can be almost perfect all of the time.\\n The Swamp Millions targets are lit, so if Thing misses you\\nmay be able to pick up some points there. The standard Graveyard\\ntimer is still in effect, so Swamp 5X will remain lit for\\na few seconds on a miss. If Thing misses but hits some swamp\\ntargets, the machine tries to recalculate things for the next\\nflip based on the landing of the shot (high or low).\\n After three complete misses, the machine will throw out\\nall the data and start from scratch. There is also a menu\\noption that will let the operator manually throw out all of\\nthe data.\\n Thing Flips is not lit in the far left inlane during multiball,\\nmultiball restart, or Thing Multiball countdown.\\n\\nMulti-Ball(TM)\\n\\nThe first step in getting to multiball is lighting locks. You\\nlight locks by spelling G-R-E-E-D (hitting the bookcase the\\nappropriate number of times). On your first multiball, the first\\nswitch you trigger each ball spots a letter. You can also gain\\na \"cheat\" GREED letter by tilting. When G-R-E-E-D is spelled,\\nthe bookcase opens and the vault is revealed.\\n If the ball happens to go into the vault while the bookcase\\nis closed, GREED will automatically be spelled, the bookcase\\nwill open instantly, and the first ball is locked. This is\\ncalled a \"dirty pool\". I like it.\\n For the first multiball, Thing\\'s Eject and the Vault will\\nlock your first ball (indicated by the green lamps). Lock\\none ball to serve another to the plunger, unless no balls\\nare in the trough, in which case one will be kicked out from\\nthe Swamp Kickout. You may lock this second ball in Thing\\'s\\nEject, the Vault, or the Swamp. Locking two balls lights both\\nthe Electric Chair and the Vault (the red lamps) to release\\nall balls and begin Multi-Ball, and also turns on the Power\\nmagnets.\\n Once the third ball is locked, all balls will be released.\\nThe first and third balls will come from the Swamp Kickout;\\nthe second will come from either the Electric Chair or the\\nSwamp Kickout, depending on where the last ball was locked.\\n The initial jackpot value is 10M. Shoot the Train Wreck\\ntarget to collect the Jackpot. Shoot the Million Plus Ramp\\nto score the Super Jackpot (for the first multiball, this\\nis a Double Jackpot.) After collecting a Jackpot or Super\\nJackpot, the vault will open; shoot a ball in the vault to\\nrelight the Super Jackpot.\\n During multiball, bookcase hits and center ramp shots add\\n1M to the jackpot, up to its maximum value of 25M. By default\\nthe jackpot value increases until it is awarded, between multiballs\\nand multiball restarts. Once the jackpot is collected, the\\njackpot value resets to 10M. You can continue to collect Super\\nJackpots as long as you can keep two balls in play.\\n If you fail to collect a Jackpot, you can restart multiball\\nby shooting Thing\\'s Eject within 20 seconds. During this time\\nno mansion rooms or stars can be collected, Thing Flips is\\nnot lit, and all center ramp shots will be sent to the right\\nflipper. The Power is not active during multiball restart.\\n Restart is a two-ball multiball, and begins immediately\\nafter plunging the second ball into play. The skill shot here\\ncan set up a pretty easy shot at the Train Wreck target and\\nthe Left Ramp. Both the Jackpot and Super Jackpot are lit\\nafter the restart. However, if you can\\'t hit Thing\\'s Eject,\\nwell, \"sorry old man\", multiball ends. There is only one restart\\nper multiball.\\n Mansion rooms, Stars, Swamp 5X, and Thing Flips cannot be\\ncollected during this and any other multiballs.\\n For the second and subsequent multiballs on normal settings,\\nyou must spell GREED via five bookcase hits, and only the\\nVault will lock balls one and two. The third can be locked\\nin the electric chair or the vault on the second multiball,\\nbut only the Vault will be able to lock ball three to start\\nthe third multiball. Super Jackpot is three times the base\\nJackpot value for all but the first multiball.\\n In a multi-player game, it is possible for one player to\\n\"unlock\" another player\\'s locked balls. For each unlock, the\\nswamp will be lit to relock the ball. This is regardless of\\ndifficulty settings or which level of multiball you are playing.\\nThe ball can be easily locked again just by plunging softly\\nso that the ball falls right into the swamp from the plunger\\nlane; it\\'s a nice fix to the \"stolen balls\" problem common\\nin manual plunger games.\\n\\nMansion Rooms\\n\\nThere are 13 rooms in the Addams\\' mansion that can be collected\\nby shooting either the electric chair or the swamp kickout when\\nthe yellow lamp is lit. The chair is normally lit at the beginning\\nof each ball, and is relit by shooting either the left or center\\nramp.\\n The next mansion room to be awarded will be flashing; rooms\\nthat have already been awarded will be solidly lit. The jet\\nbumpers change the currently flashing room. The last mansion\\nroom, denoted by \"?\", is only available after all of the other\\n12 have been collected.\\n At the beginning of the game, and after the mansion is reset\\nbecause you completed all of the rooms, either \"Mamushka\"\\nor \"Cousin It\" will be the currently flashing room.\\n The total number of mansion rooms collected over the course\\nof the game is counted and contributes to your end of ball\\nbonus. Unlike Bear Kicks, you start the game with zero mansion\\nrooms.\\n Mansion rooms can also be spotted (i.e. awarded for free)\\nby hitting the bear kick ramp enough times; see \"Bear Kicks\".\\n When the twelve rooms have been collected, the Question\\nMark is lit in the Attic. Collecting the \"?\" starts \"Tour\\nthe Mansion\" (see below). You do not have to relight the electric\\nchair/swamp kickout via the ramps or the right inlane in order\\nto collect this award. You can\\'t spot \"?\" via Bear Kicks;\\nsurpassing a level that would normally award a mansion room\\njust wastes that opportunity whenever \"?\" is the only room\\nleft.\\n Each mansion room is described in more detail below.\\n\\nMansion: 3 Million\\nAwards 3 million, and on normal settings, spots the 6M mansion\\nroom if it has not yet been collected. For the purposes of end-of-ball\\nbonus, the spotting of the 6M panel by this award is not considered\\nto be an earned mansion room.\\n In \"The Addams\\' Family Gold Edition\", this panel has been\\nreplaced by Pugsley and Wednesday\\'s Trap Door. See the section\\ncalled Metacommentary for more information about TAF\\nGold.\\n\\nMansion: Graveyard at Max\\n Advances all jet bumpers to flashing status; each jet now\\nadvances the Graveyard value by 30K until the end of the current\\nball. At the beginning of the next ball, all jet bumpers will\\nreturn to unlit status.\\n I\\'m not sure if this award affects the Grave targets at\\nall, but the normal way to advance jet bumpers is by hitting\\nGrave targets.\\n\\nMansion: Hit Cousin It\\nThis is a 20 second timed round, during which all targets score\\n200K. Each hit to Cousin It, however, increases the target value\\nby 50K, and scores 2M points.\\n The timer used in this and all other timed rounds will stop\\nwhenever any ball in play is in an eject or a tunnel. This\\nmeans that rounds which continue into regular multiball tend\\nto last a lot longer than 20 or even 30 seconds. It will also\\nstop temporarily during a ball search but then restarts again.\\n Also, the target value is scored for every switch tripped,\\nso the ramps and sinkhole shots will always trip more than\\none switch.\\n Your Cousin It bonus is initially credited with 1M points\\nat the start of the round.\\n\\nMansion: The\\nMamushka\\nThis is a 20 second timed round during\\nwhich all targets score 250K. There is no way to increase the\\ntarget value.\\n Your Mamushka bonus is initially credited with 1M points\\nat the start of the round.\\n\\nMansion: 6 Million\\nAwards 6 million points. On normal difficulty settings, it also\\nspots the 3M mansion room if it has not yet been awarded.\\n\\nMansion: Quick Multiball\\nLights Quick Multiball at Thing\\'s Eject. This remains lit until\\nit is collected (by default). You cannot lock balls at Thing\\'s\\nEject or collect the Thing Bonus while it is lit. It becomes\\nunavailable temporarily during any multiball or multiball restart.\\n Shoot Thing\\'s Eject to begin. Thing will take the ball and\\nsend it to the swamp kickout; another ball will be served\\nto the plunger unless two balls have been locked, in which\\ncase it will come from the Swamp Kickout. During Quick Multiball,\\nthe Vault will be open and will score 5M points. This value\\nincreases by 1M each time \"Vault Millions\" is collected or\\nthe center ramp is hit, up to a maximum value of 10M.\\n There may be some problems with this round or Thing Multiball\\nwhenever Tunnel Hunt is running; see \"Mansion: Tunnel Hunt\".\\n If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball\\nis lit, Thing Multiball only will be started instead.\\n\\nMansion: Tunnel Hunt\\nThis is a 20 second timed round in which you should shoot the\\nthree tunnel shots: the electric chair, the swamp (or swamp\\nkickout), and the vault. They may be shot in any order. The\\nfirst scores 5M, the second is worth 10M, and the third is worth\\n15M.\\n The round starts with the quote \"Look darling, just what\\nwe\\'ve been searching for\" by Morticia. The quotes for each\\ntunnel searched are: 1st tunnel: \"Perhaps it\\'s in here.\"\\n 2nd tunnel: \"There it is.\"\\n 3rd tunnel: \"Just what we\\'ve been searching for.\"\\n If the electric chair is lit, hitting the electric chair\\nduring Tunnel Hunt will also award another mansion room. (Same\\ngoes for the swamp kickout.)\\n If the vault was previously lit for lock, you will not be\\nable to lock balls during Tunnel Hunt. It will relight at\\nthe end of the round. Once the vault has been hit, it will\\nclose. If Quick Multiball or Thing Multiball is running, it\\nmay or may not close (hopefully it won\\'t, of course).\\n Plunging a ball into the swamp while Tunnel Hunt is running\\ndoes not give credit for the tunnel. Hitting the bookcase\\nduring Tunnel Hunt when the vault should be open will not\\nconvince the game to open it.\\n\\nMansion: Seance\\nThis is a 20 second timed round during which the next three\\nramp shots (either Million Plus or Bear Kick ramp) will score\\n5M, 10M, and 15M each. The Power magnets are enabled throughout\\nthe round.\\n The round starts with Gomez saying \"Seance ... knock three\\ntimes.\" Successive ramp shots will then producing one, two,\\nor three knocking sounds followed by Gomez saying \"Once\",\\n\"Twice\", or \"Thrice ... well done.\"\\n Bear Kick ramps will always feed to Thing\\'s mini-flipper,\\nexcept when Thing Multiball is counting down. Thing Flips\\nis still possible during Seance.\\n\\n\\nMansion:\\n9 Million\\nAwards 9 million points. Wow.\\n\\nMansion: Thing\\nMultiball\\nMuch like Quick Multiball, this is a count-down\\naward lit at Thing\\'s Eject. Hitting this immediately scores\\n15M, but this value counts down quickly to 3M before it expires.\\nThere is a short grace period once the timer reaches 3M. Shoot\\nThing\\'s Eject to score the value immediately and set the value\\nof the vault during Thing Multiball. During the countdown, *all*\\nbear kick shots will return the ball to the right inlane, no\\nmatter what. Thing Flips inlane is not lit during the countdown\\nor the actual multiball.\\n A second ball is sent to the plunger if possible (see \"Quick\\nMultiball\" for details if this is not the case), and multi-ball\\nplay begins as soon as it is plunged, in the same manner as\\nQuick Multiball. However, the value of the vault is fixed\\nand cannot be increased.\\n If Thing Multiball is counting down while Quick Multiball\\nis lit, Thing Multiball will be started instead, and Quick\\nMultiball cannot be collected until Thing Multiball ends.\\n If you have spotted Thing Multiball by bear kicks, you can\\nshoot Thing before the mansion fanfare finishes. However,\\nyou will NOT be awarded the instant 15M points. The vault\\nvalue is still fixed to 15M and an otherwise normal Thing\\nMultiball continues.\\n\\nMansion: Raise the Dead\\nThis award starts a 30 second timed round in which hits to the\\njet bumpers add to your Raise the Dead bonus. The bumpers will\\nall flash, even though this award has nothing to do with the\\nnormal status of the jets (unlit, lit, and flashing). Shoot\\neach bumper four times to score 3M points; each bumper hit is\\nalso worth 100K also. The Raise the Dead bonus begins at 2M.\\n Whenever one of the bumpers is hit for the fourth time,\\nit becomes solidly lit. The dot matrix will show you a grave\\nfor each of the bumpers and how many more times each bumper\\nneeds to be hit.\\n When all bumpers have been hit four times, the round ends\\nimmediately. You can, however, continue to collect 100K per\\nhit for bumpers which have already been hit four times until\\nthe round is over.\\n\\nMansion: Extra Ball\\nThis mansion room simply lights an Extra Ball at Thing\\'s Eject.\\nUnder normal settings, it will remain lit until collected.\\n\\nTour the Mansion\\n\\nWhenever the 12th mansion award has been collected or started,\\nthe electric chair will be re-lit automatically and the \"?\"\\nwill be flashing. Shooting the chair (or swamp kickout, of course)\\nwill start \"Tour the Mansion\", which is as follows:\\n All of the mansion rooms become unlit. Basically, Tour the\\nMansion has a lot in common with Whirlwind in that the mega-award\\nis simply to re-award everything (almost everything, actually).\\n 50 million points is awarded (as clearly indicated by Gomez).\\nThe 3M, 6M, and 9M rooms light up at this point.\\n \"Special\" is lit in the outlanes. By default, these outlanes\\nare \"hard\", meaning that only one of them is lit at a time,\\nchanging whenever a slingshot is hit. Quick Multiball lights\\nup now, even though it has nothing to do with Specials.\\n The Graveyard is maximized (all jet bumpers flash). The\\ncorresponding room is lit.\\n An extra ball is lit at Thing\\'s Eject, and the EB room is\\nlit. This is a temporary extra ball, which must be collected\\nbefore you drain or it will go away.\\n Each of the remaining room rounds is started one at a time,\\nin the following order: Mamushka, Hit Cousin It, Seance, Tunnel\\nHunt, Raise the Dead, and Thing Multiball. The first five\\nare all timed and end as soon as the timer expires or you\\ndrain. Thing Multiball ends if you fail to start the round\\n(as usual by shooting Thing\\'s Eject), or if you do start two-ball\\nplay, when you return to one ball.\\n Any rounds running when the Tour is started continue to\\nrun during the Tour. It is extremely distressing if you have\\nto contend with the Power during the Tour because you had\\nstarted the Seance round before starting the Tour.\\n If you reach a number of bear kicks that would ordinarily\\nspot a mansion room while Touring, that free room is wasted.\\nIt does not carry over to the next mansion, nor does it affect\\nTour the Mansion in any way.\\n If you complete all of the above, the Tour ends quietly.\\nFor the remainder of that ball, you will be unable to collect\\nmansion awards.\\n The extra ball lit by Touring is \"hard\" by default; it must\\nbe collected on that ball or it will disappear. Likewise,\\n\"Special\" will also be unavailable after the ball ends.\\n Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead bonuses collected\\nbefore Touring carry over into the Tour, i.e. your base totals\\nfor the round are what you had before you toured, plus the\\n1M or 2M normally given for starting the round.\\n Previous versions of this guide said that \"?\" isn\\'t really\\nconsidered a mansion room since it isn\\'t added to the count\\nas part of your end- of-ball bonus. This is wrong: starting\\nTour the Mansion awards one mansion room just like all of\\nthe other rooms. Each mansion round played during Tour the\\nMansion, however, has no effect on this counter.\\n\\nEnd of Ball Bonus\\n\\nBonus is calculated at the end of each ball as follows: 100K\\nfor each bear kick, up to the maximum 99.\\n 500K for each mansion room, with no apparent limit. The\\ndisplay has trouble with values over 99, though.\\n The sum of the above is multiplied by the bonus multiplier,\\nfrom 1x to 5x.\\n Any Mamushka, Cousin It, and Raise the Dead totals are added.\\n Scoring 20M or more in bonus generates a quote from Gomez:\\n\"Who says you can\\'t take it with you?\" However, the quote\\nwill not be delivered unless you played at least one of the\\ntimed rounds during the ball.\\n\\nCombos\\n\\nThere are two 3-way combos, worth 5M each:\\n Right inlane, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp\\n Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus Ramp, Swamp\\n And one 4-way combo, worth 10M:\\n Bear kick ramp, Adv Bonus X loop, Million Plus ramp, Swamp\\n Scoring the 4-way combo also awards the points for the 3-way\\ncombo (since the first 3 of the 4 forms one of the 3-way combos).\\nThis makes the 4-way very valuable: 15M + bonus X advanced\\n+ at least 1M from the ramp + at least 5M for the 5X graveyard\\nvalue + 5M for the Star when you collect Thing Bonus.\\n\\nDefaults\\n\\nThe following information was taken from The Addams Family manual,\\ncourtesy of Jonathan Deitch (musjndx@gsusgi2.gsu.edu). It is\\na list of game features that can be altered by the operator.\\nNormally these are left alone, but adjusting the overall difficulty\\nof the machine or setting games to 5-balls will change a lot\\nof these.\\n 1. Extra Ball Percent: desired % of games in which the first\\nBear Kick extra ball should be collected. This value is used\\ninternally to reflex the number of bear kicks required. Range\\nis 15-40% It can also be set to FIXED such that the first\\nbear kick extra ball level does not reflex. Default is 25%.\\n 2. 1st Bear Kick extra ball level: set 1. to fixed and this\\noption will set the number of bear kicks required for the\\nfirst extra ball. Default is 8.\\n 3. 2nd Bear Kick extra ball level: This value ranges from\\n30-99 and does not reflex. Default is 50.\\n 4. Train Wreck Extra Ball Available: Default is to award\\nextra balls at a certain number of train wrecks.\\n 5. Bear Kick EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\\n 6. House EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\\n 7. Train Wreck EB Memory: Default is to hold between balls.\\n 8. Last Thing Lock: This is the final multiball level on\\nwhich Thing will lock balls. Default is for the first multiball\\nonly. This value ranges from 0-5.\\n 9. Last Swamp Lock: This is the final multiball level on\\nwhich the Swamp will light to lock ball two. Default is for\\nthe first multiball only. The value ranges from 1-5.\\n 10. Last Chair Release: This is the final multiball level\\non which the electric chair can be shot to start multiball.\\nDefault is for the first and second multiballs. The value\\nranges from 0-5.\\n 11. Jackpot Carryover: When set this retains the value of\\nthe jackpot until it is hit; when off, the jackpot will reset\\nat the end of each multiball or multiball restart. Default\\nis to carryover jackpots.\\n 12. Million Plus Memory: Default is to reset the value of\\nthe Million Plus at the end of each ball. Change this and\\nscoring would become atrocious.\\n 13. Million Plus Maximum: Default upper limit of the Million\\nPlus is 10M. This value can range from 5M to 20M.\\n 14. Thing Multiball Start: This value can range from 10M\\nto 20M. Default starting value of Thing Multiball is 15M.\\n 15. Room from Swamp: Default is to award mansion rooms from\\nthe swamp kickout.\\n 16. Free THING Letters: Up to 5 THING letters can be spotted\\nat the beginning of the game. Default is 3.\\n 17. Raise the Dead Hits: The number of hits per jet bumper\\ncan be set from 3-9. Default is 4.\\n 18. Train Wreck Hits: By default, 2 hits are required for\\nthe first Train Wreck. This value can range from 2-4. Successive\\ntrain wrecks always require 1 more hit up to the maximum of\\n6.\\n 19. Special Memory: By default, specials disappear at the\\nend of the current ball.\\n 20. Train Wreck Memory: By default, the train wreck hits\\ncount carries over between balls.\\n 21. Quick Multiball Memory: By default, Quick Multiball\\nwill remain lit between balls until it is hit.\\n 22. Tour EB Memory: By default, the Extra Ball lit during\\nTour the Mansion will disappear at the end of the current\\nball.\\n 23. Tour Difficulty. Default is a medium setting, in which\\nthe 6M and 3M rooms will spot each other. On the hard setting,\\neach must be collected separately.\\n\\nProblems\\n\\nWhile this game is perfect in many ways, none is completely\\nimmune to problems or failures. Here are some of the more common\\nproblems:\\n Balls can get stuck inside the swamp, on the swamp, on top\\nof Thing\\'s box, on jet bumpers, and on the circular plate\\nthat the bookcase sits upon. The machine will perform ball\\nsearches until it finds the missing ball -- firing all the\\njet bumpers, spinning the vault, etc. *but* it will not fire\\nthe swamp kickout if a ball has been locked there at first.\\nEventually, if the ball has not been found, it will serve\\na new ball in the plunger lane, or if no balls are in the\\ntrough, it will try to fire one from the swamp kickout.\\n If you tilt, it will end the current ball, but the next\\nball won\\'t start until it finds the missing ball(s). The only\\nsolution short of removing the stuck ball at this point is\\nto power cycle the game and start over unless you have locked\\nballs; it will kick out ALL locked balls after two or three\\nball searches. However, once these drain, if the ball is still\\nlost the problem can easily resurface.\\n If you abort the game and start a new one, when pressing\\nStart the game will let you know if a pinball is missing and\\ntry to find it a couple of times, but eventually it will give\\nup and play with what\\'s available. There are only three balls\\ninstalled in the machine; it will function even if only one\\nis available (though obviously multiball loses its meaning\\n:-)\\n The only diverter is located in the upper left corner where\\nthe two ramps meet. If it gets stuck, you may find all balls\\ngoing to the same spot -- either the mini-flipper or the right\\ninlane. This may or may not be a \"problem\". I\\'ve also heard\\nof balls getting lodged back there somehow.\\n If the machine decides that there are faulty switches (because\\nthey haven\\'t been hit in a while), it will try to compensate.\\nIf one of the ramp switches is bad, the other ramp will award\\nboth of them. If the bookcase won\\'t open, you can lock balls\\nat the Thing Ramp. If Thing can\\'t pick up the ball from the\\neject, then it will just remain there. I\\'m sure that there\\nare many more that I haven\\'t seen.\\n\\nQuotes\\n\\nSomeone has already taken care of this for me. A list of all\\nthe quotes is currently available from the r.g.p. FTP archive\\non pinball.cc.cmu.edu,\\nas /Quotes/taf.quotes\\n\\nMusic\\n\\nThe following is a list of the musical pieces in The Addams\\nFamily:\\n Addams Theme: Played at the beginning of your first ball\\nuntil you plunge the ball into play. Also played during attract\\nmode and the explanation of \"Tour the Mansion.\"\\n Normal Game Theme: Played during normal game play, when\\nno special rounds are active.\\n Mamushka Theme: Played during the Mamushka round.\\n Cousin It Theme: Played during Cousin It round.\\n Tunnel Hunt Theme: Played during Tunnel Hunt round.\\n Seance Theme: Hardly music, but played during Seance round.\\n Raise the Dead Theme: Played during Raise the Dead round.\\n Thing Multiball Countdown Theme\\n Quick/Thing Multiball Theme: Played during quick MB rounds.\\n Multiball Release Theme: Played while two balls are locked\\nand you\\'re trying to lock the third for Multiball.\\n Multiball Theme: Played until you score your first jackpot.\\n Jackpot Theme: Played after you score a jackpot UNTIL YOU\\nEND THAT BALL, even after multiball is over, or until you\\nstart multiball again. It\\'s a souped-up version of the Addams\\nTheme.\\n It\\'s also the Enter Initials Theme.\\n Multiball Restart Theme: Played while Thing Multiball restart\\nis lit, it\\'s just one particular part of the Addams Theme\\nbeing played over and over. The same music is also played\\nwhile the features of \"Tour the Mansion\" are being explained.\\n\\nCows\\n\\nLike most Bally/Williams pinballs, there are cows in this game\\n(or at least images of them). During attract mode, there is\\na sequence of flipper button/start presses that will cause the\\ncows to come up during attract mode. There is also a sequence\\nthat causes the game\\'s credits to appear with rather loud accompaniment.\\n Using the notation L=left flipper, R=right flipper, and\\nS=start button:\\n Cows: 7L, 1S, 14R, 1S, 20L, 1S\\n Credits: 13L, 1S, 1R, 1S, 2L, 1S\\n These sequences only work for L-1 machines and later, and\\nsometimes you may have to power cycle the game to get it to\\nwork. Also, there can\\'t be any credits on the game at the\\ntime, since hitting the start button would thus begin a game.\\n\\nMetacommentary\\n\\nThe Addams Family was released in 1991, and\\nwas designed by Pat Lawlor, creator of Whirlwind, Funhouse,\\nand later, Twilight Zone and Road Show. It was, of course, inspired\\nby the television series of the same name. Since then, it has\\nbecome the number one selling pinball of all time, surpassing\\nsuch classics as \"Eight Ball Deluxe\".\\n To commemorate this noteworthy accomplishment, in the spring\\nof 1994 TAF was placed back onto the production line -- 2500\\n\"Gold Edition\" machines were made, mostly for collectors and\\nnot distribution. There are differences between the new TAF\\nGold and the original, such as:\\n Gold-colored lockdown bars, jet bumper caps, vaults, and\\nThing boxes.\\n More quotes have been added; none have been removed.\\n A new game feature called \"Cousin It\\'s Lost items\". Some\\nof the mansion rooms contain hats, hairbrushes, keys, etc.\\nworth bonus points and even extra balls and specials.\\n The 3M mansion room has been replaced by \"Pugsley and Wednesday\\'s\\nTrap Door\". It scores 3M but serves as a link to another one\\nof the mansion rooms. Because of this, it does not automatically\\nspot the 6M mansion room anymore.\\n For more detailed information on TAF Gold,\\nsee Keith Johnson\\'s rulesheet.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis \"Addams Family\" guide has been brought to you by Brian\\nDominy (gt6139a@prism.gatech.edu) but with the help of many\\nothers.

It is a Pat Lawlor design, who is\\nfamous for his other works including Whirlwind, FunHouse, and Twilight Zone.\\nThis pin was so popular, it broke the production record of most pins\\nmanufactured (of the same type) which was like 22,000 held by former champ\\nEight Ball Deluxe (early 1980\\'s).  It is said that the machine that broke the\\nrecord was all made up in gold (like gold legs, gold metal around other parts\\nof the machine, etc.).  Whereas details of this record-breaking machine are\\nsketchy to say the least, these characteristics hold for this new limited\\nedition release of TAF.\\n\\nObviously, most of the parts are not pure gold, but more than likely are\\ngold-color painted.  Lots of other parts of the machine (other than the metal\\noutside) are also gold-colored:  the vault, the tops of the pop bumpers,\\nThing\\'s box...  Each machine of TAF Special Collector\\'s Edition (TAFG, for\\nTAF Gold) is numbered (out of supposedly 1000 machines - a very limited run\\nindeed) and includes a certificate signed by the members of the design team.\\nThe number of the machine is located on a gold plate on the lower right-hand\\ncorner of the front of the machine.  FWIW, the machine I\\'ve been playing is\\n#0959.  :)\\n\\nWARNING - This guide may contain SPOILERS that you don\\'t really want to know\\nabout right away and find out for yourself (the \"?\" of the Mansion comes to\\nmind).  Most sections are labelled pretty carefully, so you should be able to\\navoid reading that which you don\\'t want to read.  However, I take no\\nresponsibility for you finding out stuff you didn\\'t already know.  :)\\n\\nK = 1,000; M = 1,000,000; B = 1,000,000,000.  The notation \"xM+yM to zM\"\\nmeans it starts at xM points, goes up yM points every time it is awarded, but\\nnever goes higher than zM points.\\n\\nEdition Differences\\n\\nMost people are more than likely familiar with the original version of TAF.\\nIn the interest of completeness, though, this will be a guide to the entire\\ngame.  This section briefly describes the differences between the old TAF and\\nTAFG.\\n\\n\\nCousin It\\'s Hideout  Some rooms in the mansion (it\\'s always random) contain\\n        belongings of Cousin It.  Depending on what you find, you are given\\n        an award of some sort.  For full details, see the section following\\n        the Mansion description.\\n\\nSuper Seance  There seems to be about a 50% chance than any given time you\\n        shoot the Seance Mansion award, you will get a Super Seance instead.\\n        See the description in the Mansion section.\\n\\n3M  The 3M and 6M awards are NOT attached any more.  However, the 3M will\\n        give you another room.  See the 3M under the Mansion secion.\\n\\nMultiball  A couples changes in Multiball rules:  The starting jackpot for\\n        Multiball now varies, and Dirty Pool during Multiball will award a\\n        Super Jackpot and leave it lit.  See the Multiball section.\\n\\nLocked balls  Any balls that were locked for Multiball are kicked out of the\\n        Swamp automatically at the end of the game now.  It is adjustable,\\n        but this is the default behavior.\\n\\nExtra ball buyin  There is one on TAFG.  It can be set to allow anywhere\\n        from 0-99 buyins, and it doesn\\'t matter how many you use because\\n        you\\'ll be able to get on the high score chart regardless.\\n\\nQuotes  There\\'s a load of new quotes in TAFG.  Some are more understandable\\n        than others, though.  They don\\'t have any impact on gameplay, it\\'s\\n        just that some of them are pretty cool.  :)\\n\\n\\nThere may be other things that differ that we don\\'t know about yet.  Also,\\nsome things have not yet been accomplished on TAFG.  In these cases, the\\nlimits set forth in TAF (which have been well documented) will be used.  For\\nexample, I have not gotten to the maximum value of the Graveyard yet, but in\\nTAF it was 4M.  Therefore, I assume that the maximum is 4M for TAFG as well.\\nShould anything ever be found to be different, you can bet that it\\'ll be\\nchanged in this guide.\\n\\nPlayfield Layout\\n\\nI\\'ll start at the bottom center and go clockwise around.\\n\\n\\nFlippers  The 2 at the bottom are normal full-length flippers.\\n\\nLeft slingshot  A normal slingshot.\\n\\nLeft inlanes  There are 2 of them, both leading to the left flipper.  The\\n        left one lights the middle ramp for \"Thing Flips\" for about 8\\n        seconds.  The right one lights the middle ramp for 2 Bear Kicks\\n        instead of just one for about 4 seconds.\\n\\nLeft outlane  It can be lit for a Special, but that\\'s about it.\\n\\nThing flipper  This is a mini-flipper which is used to shoot the Swamp.  The\\n        ball can go to this flipper either as one of 2 exits from the\\n        Graveyard or from the ramps.  (The left ramp always feeds to the\\n        Thing flipper, and the ramp diverter can be opened so that the middle\\n        ramp does too.)  When the ball comes down from the ramp or the\\n        Graveyard (or if it wanders up far enough from down below), it\\'ll\\n        trigger an opto that lights the Swamp.\\n\\nG and R targets  Located between the 2 exits of the Graveyard (the left loop\\n        shot and the Thing flipper lane), these 2 standup targets make up the\\n        first 2 letters in Grave.\\n\\nElectric Chair  This is a kickout hole with a (gold) plastic chair above it.\\n        There are 2 lights indicating its status on either side of the chair.\\n        The yellow light indicates that a shot to the chair will award the\\n        currently flashing Mansion award.  The red light indicates that the\\n        chair will start Multiball.  When balls get kicked out, they head\\n        towards the middle of the left flipper (usually).\\n\\nGraveyard  This is the name given to the pop bumper area.  There are 5\\n        bumpers here.  Each hit gives some kind of scream or moan or gasp and\\n        briefly disturbs the appropiate grave on the display as well as adds\\n        to the current Graveyard value.\\n\\nLeft loop  This is the passage through the Graveyard that goes around the\\n        back of the game, feeding to the upper right flipper.  \"Adv. X\" can\\n        be lit for this shot by going through the right inlane.  Making this\\n        shot also lights the \"light star\" light on the left ramp for about 4\\n        seconds.\\n\\nCousin It  The Cousin It targets are located above and to the right of the\\n        Electric Chair, sloping away from a direct shot at them from the\\n        bottom right flipper.  Just to the right of the standup targets is a\\n        picture of Cousin It.  The only time the targets are used is during\\n        the Cousin It round of the Mansion.  Any time you hit the targets\\n        will generally get you a random squeal from It.\\n\\nLeft ramp  This ramp is only directly makable from a upper-right flipper\\n        shot.  Any shot to it will always award Million Plus (1M+1M up to\\n        10M) and light the next letter in THING.  If \"light star\" is lit (by\\n        shooting the left loop first), then you\\'ll also be awarded one of the\\n        THING stars.  This is also the Super Jackpot shot during Multiball.\\n        It feeds to the Thing flipper.  The first time it is shot each ball\\n        you may hear \"Not bad.\" from Gomez sometimes followed by \"I know,\\n        darling.\" from Tish.  Other times you\\'ll hear \"Play ball!\"  Also,\\n        each shot spots the next unlit letter in GRAVE.\\n\\nTrain  This is a lane located just above the entrance to the left ramp with\\n        a standup target and the end.  Getting a certain number of train hits\\n        will award a train wreck.  This is also the Jackpot shot during\\n        Multiball.\\n\\nThing ramp  This is a tiny ramp shootable from the bottom right flipper,\\n        though sometimes a weird brick shot from the upper right flipper will\\n        also land the ball here.  There are 4 status lights for this ramp.\\n        The 2 lights on the playfield are Extra Ball and Multiball.  Above\\n        the ramp are a green light which indicates a ball can be locked here\\n        for multiball and a yellow light which indicates that you can collect\\n        the next THING value.  You can always get the extra ball when it is\\n        lit by shooting this ramp, but only 1 of the other 3 things may be\\n        collected at a time on any one shot.  The priority of awards is\\n        Multiball then lock (green light) then THING award (yellow light).\\n        The ball goes down a small lane to the kickout saucer.\\n\\nA target  This standup target is located between the entrances to the Thing\\n        ramp and the middle ramp.  It is part of the Grave targets.\\n\\nMiddle ramp  Shooting this ramp will add 1 to your \"Bear Kicks.\"  You start\\n        the game with 1, and various numbers along the way will give you\\n        awards.  An extra ball will light after 6-14 Kicks (self-adjusting)\\n        and at 50 Kicks.  Also, every 15+10 Kicks (up to 95) will spot the\\n        currently flashing Mansion award (unless it\\'s the \"?\").  This ramp\\n        can be lit for 2 Bear Kicks via the right left inlane and/or Thing\\n        Flips via the left left inlane.  During Multiball, it adds 1M to the\\n        Jackpot.  During Quick Multiball, it adds 1M to the Vault Jackpot.\\n        It is also the \"V\" shot in Grave.  Typically, the ball will be fed to\\n        the right inlane, though it may go to the Thing flipper if Seance is\\n        running or if Thing Flips is lit.\\n\\n*THING*  This display is located just under the dot matrix display on the\\n        backglass.  Every time you shoot the left ramp, the next unlit letter\\n        is lit up.  You can light up to both of the stars by shooting the\\n        ramp when \"light star\" is lit on the left ramp.  Typically, you\\'ll\\n        start the game off with 3 letters, though this is adjustable.  You\\n        can still earn stars even if THING is already spelled.  Collect the\\n        THING award at the Thing ramp/kickout saucer.\\n\\nBookcase  This is the big gold block sitting on a gold round turntable.  On\\n        it is a sign that says something like \"Spell GREED to light locks.\"\\n        Well, that\\'s just what you do.  When the Bookcase is closed (facing\\n        you), then shooting it will usually award you the next letter in\\n        GREED.  When the bookcase is open, it reveals a shot to the Vault.\\n\\nVault  This is a hold behind the Bookcase, generally only shootable when the\\n        Bookcase is open.  Of course, given the way pinball is, a ball could\\n        always wander into it when it isn\\'t open...  Above the Vault are 2\\n        status lights.  A green light means that a ball can be locked there\\n        for Multiball, and a red light means that that shot will start\\n        Multiball OR that it\\'s lit for a Jackpot (during one of the Quick\\n        Multiballs) OR that it\\'ll light the Super Jackpot if it isn\\'t lit\\n        during Multiball.\\n\\nKickout saucer  This saucer can get a ball in it in 3 different ways.  It is\\n        fed to from the Thing lane (shot by the Thing ramp) and by a slow-\\n        moving ball that drops down from the plunger ramp.  Also, a ball that\\n        kind of dribbles around the upper right corner may plop into it.\\n        Anytime the ball goes into the saucer, whether it was shot from the\\n        Thing ramp, plunger lane, or a lucky bounce, whatever was lit at the\\n        Thing ramp will be awarded.  For example, you could drain with an\\n        extra ball lit, then (presuming it stays lit between balls), get the\\n        extra ball off of the skill shot.  Thing will pick up the ball here\\n        if a lock, THING, or Multiball is lit.\\n\\nThing  Thing resides in the gold box that takes up the upper right corner of\\n        playfield.  Basically, he\\'s a plastic hand with a magnet on his\\n        fingertips that allows him to \"pick up\" balls.  See the kickout\\n        saucer description above to find out when he comes out.  For all\\n        awards except THING, once he has retreated back into the box, the\\n        magnet will deactivate and the ball will follow a path to the Swamp\\n        kickout.  If THING was awarded, though, Thing will come back out and\\n        put the ball back into the saucer.\\n\\nRight loop  Shooting the ball around here has no really useful purpose\\n        except to get the ball into the Graveyard.  Sometimes during\\n        Multiball, the game will get confused and give you Adv. X (the left\\n        loop award) if it\\'s lit.\\n\\nPlunger ramp  The ball travels up this ramp when you launch it with the\\n        (manual) plunger.  Just beyond the gate lies an entrance to the Swamp\\n        which the ball will go into if not launched very hard.  The skill\\n        shot is to get the ball to go just off the end of the ramp into the\\n        kickout saucer.  The skill shot is worth 2M+1M to 5M.  You can also\\n        plunge the ball very hard and it\\'ll go around the right loop into the\\n        Graveyard.  If lock is lit in the Swamp, you can soft plunge the ball\\n        and let it fall into there and get credit for the lock.  If you slam\\n        the plunger with the palm of your hand with all of your might, the\\n        ball will doubtlessly get lodged under the middle ramp, so I don\\'t\\n        highly recommend doing this.\\n\\nUpper-right flipper  A full-length flipper which you can use to hit the left\\n        ramp, Train, Cousin It, and the Bookcase.  Various other trick shots\\n        are possible, like shooting the Thing ramp, the middle ramp(!), and\\n        an open Vault off of Cousin It.  Balls are fed to it from the kickout\\n        saucer and the left loop.\\n\\nSwamp Millions targets  These standup targets are located around the Swamp,\\n        1 above and 2 below.  When the Swamp is lit for 5x Graveyard, these\\n        targets are also active.  Each one you hit while 5x Graveyard is lit\\n        is worth 1M points.  Otherwise, they\\'re not worth very much at all\\n        (token points).  You may think of these as consolation points for\\n        missing that blasted shot to the Swamp from the Thing flipper, but\\n        their real purpose is to let the game know how off Thing was on his\\n        calculated shot from \"Thing Flips.\"  If he hits the top target, he\\n        waits a little longer, one of the bottom 2, he speeds up a little.\\n\\nSwamp  When unlit, the Swamp awards the Graveyard value.  When lit for 5x\\n        Graveyard, amazingly enough it awards just that.  Lock may also be\\n        lit here, and when it is, you can just plunge a ball softly so that\\n        it lands there.\\n\\nSwamp kickout  Any ball that goes into the Swamp from the plunger, Swamp\\n        shot, or from Thing will get kicked out here to the right flipper.\\n        This is also the \"E\" shot in Grave, though you must actually shoot\\n        the kickout itself rather than let a ball get kicked out from it.\\n        Shooting the kickout (tricky, because it\\'s all the way on the right\\n        of the playfield) will also award you the next Mansion room when the\\n        Electric Chair is lit on normal settings, unlighting the Electric\\n        Chair.\\n\\nRight outlane  Same as left...  Special can be lit here, but that\\'s it.\\n\\nRight inlane  When the ball goes through the right inlane, it lights the\\n        left loop for \"Adv. X,\" which is the bonus multiplier for about 5\\n        seconds.  For the same length of time, it\\'ll light the Electric Chair\\n        temporarily if it is not permanently lit.\\n\\nRight slingshot  A normal slingshot.\\n\\nPower  In the middle of the playfield right above the flippers is an area\\n        mysteriously marked \"The Power.\"  The Power is active during certain\\n        times and is basically 3 spinning magnets that can absolutely wreak\\n        havoc with balls on top of the playfield.  This can also lead to some\\n        amazingly interesting, funny, and devastating results.  You can tell\\n        if The Power is active by whether its light is flashing or not.\\n\\n\\nGameplay\\n\\nThere are 2 main objectives to TAFG:  Getting Mansion rooms and getting\\nMultiball to score Jackpots.  Both the Mansion and Multiball have their own\\nsections in this rulesheet.  However, there is also tons of other stuff you\\ncan do to score points in this game.  Scoring was pretty high when the\\noriginal TAF first came out, but by games of today\\'s standards, TAFG tends to\\nbe on the lower side.  On an average machine, the replay will probably hover\\naround 100M +/- 20M depending on the machine itself and the ability of the\\nlocals, assuming auto-percentaging is on.  The default replay boost is 8M.\\n\\nSkill Shot\\n\\nFor the skill shot, try to plunge the ball just hard enough to get it to land\\nin the kickout saucer.  The skill shot is worth 2M+1M up to 5M points each\\ntime you make it.  You can get the skill shot any time you plunge the ball\\nwhen it is served to you by the game to the plunger lane.  If a ball airballs\\ninto the plunger lane, you can\\'t get a skill shot.\\n\\nIf the ball doesn\\'t quite make it up the plunger ramp, then it\\'ll fall into\\nthe Swamp.  (\"Don\\'t torture yourself, darling.\" or \"You should know better.\"\\nor \"Have a nice swim!\" or \"The primeval ooze.\")  If the lock was lit at the\\nSwamp, then the ball gets locked (\"Good thinking!\").\\n\\nIf the ball goes beyond the kickout saucer but doesn\\'t hit anything AT ALL\\n(meaning you have scored 0 points) and drains then you are simply given the\\nball back to try again.  Note that the outlanes score points!  This is\\napplicable ANY time you are given the ball at the plunger, including the\\nstart of Multiballs!  Basically, if your score is still flashing (as opposed\\nto being swept off and back on), then you can let it safely go.\\n\\nTHING\\n\\nTHING letters are on the backglass.  On normal settings, you start the game\\nwith 3 letters (THI).  Every time you shoot the left ramp, you get the next\\nletter.  When THING is complete, you may shoot the Thing ramp to get the\\nTHING value.  Thing will then come out of his box and pick up the ball (\"No,\\nno, no!\" or \"No time for that now, Thing.\").  He\\'ll then come back out of the\\nbox and put the ball back into the kickout saucer.  THING is worth 5M the\\nfirst time, then 10M, then a maximum of 15M.  For each star you have (up to\\n2), you get an additional 5M from the THING value.  You get a star by making\\na left loop->left ramp combo (shooting the left ramp when \"light star\" is\\nlit).  Therefore, you can get up to 25M from THING at one time.\\n\\nIf lights are burned out or something, the display will tell you which\\nletters you have already gotten when you shoot the left ramp.  Also, it is\\nmentioned in the Status Report.\\n\\nGRAVE Letters\\n\\nThere are 5 letters scattered over the playfield that spell GRAVE.  The G and\\nR are located just to the right of the Thing flipper, the A is just to the\\nleft of the middle ramp, the V is the middle ramp, and the E is the Swamp\\nkickout.  Each time you hit an unlit letter, you spot one of the pop bumpers.\\nThe bumpers always start each ball unlit, and are spotted starting with the\\ntop one and working down.  The first time through will light each bumper, and\\nthe second time will cause them to flash.  Therefore, spelling GRAVE\\ncompletely two times on one ball will flash all of the bumpers.  The bumpers\\nthemselves are worth token points depending on their status.  Their real\\nvalue lies in increasing the Graveyard.\\n\\nThe left ramp awards the next unlit letter in order in GRAVE.\\n\\nThe GRAVE value is awarded instantly upon completing GRAVE.  It is worth\\n2M+1M up to 10M.  The value is held throughout the game (it never goes down).\\n\\nGraveyard\\n\\nThe Graveyard value starts at 1M at the beginning of each ball, unless it was\\nheld by a Train Wreck from the last ball (see next section).  Each pop bumper\\nhit increases the Graveyard value by 10K if unlit, 20K if lit, and 30K if\\nflashing.  (See previous section for spotting bumpers.)  The Mansion award\\n\"Graveyard at max\" will instantly make all bumpers flashing.\\n\\nThe Swamp will award the current Graveyard value.  The Swamp can be lit if\\nthe ball goes through the lane just above the Thing flipper for 5x the\\ncurrent Graveyard value (\"Quicksand, fumes, toxic waste...  It\\'s all ours!\").\\nThe maximum value the Graveyard can reach is 4M.\\n\\nTrain Wreck\\n\\nEvery time you hit the Train shot, you are awarded 1M points.  However, after\\na certain number of hits, you are awarded a Train Wreck instead, worth 5M\\npoints.  On normal settings, the 2nd Train hit will earn you a Train Wreck\\n(\"Good show old man!\").  After that, the number of hits for a Train Wreck\\nwill go up by one.  The maximum number of hits you can ever need for a Train\\nWreck is 6 (I think).\\n\\nOn harder settings, more hits will be required for your first Train Wreck,\\nand will go up from there.  A typical 5-ball setting is to have the Train\\nWreck need 3 hits for the first one.\\n\\nTrain Wrecks are good for 2 reasons:  Every time you get a Train Wreck, you\\nhold the value of the Graveyard to the next ball (instead of it resetting to\\n1M).  Also, 4 Train Wrecks will light the extra ball.  (That means 14 Train\\nhits:  2+3+4+5.  Or more, if your game is set harder.)  Nothing special\\nhappens after the 4th Train Wreck (it will still hold the Graveyard, though).\\n\\nBear Kicks\\n\\n\\nYou start the game with 1 Bear Kick.  Every time you shoot the middle ramp,\\nyou get 1 more Bear Kick, or 2 more if it was lit from the right left inlane.\\nAt 6-14 Bear Kicks, the extra ball is lit (self-adjustable).  An extra ball\\nis also lit at 50 Bear Kicks (though this may change with difficulty\\nsettings).  At 15 Bear Kicks, the currently flashing Mansion room is spotted\\n(awarded).  Every 10 Bear Kicks after that will also spot a Mansion room, up\\nto 95.  However, Mansion rooms will never be spotted during any Multiball,\\nand if you pass 1 or more spot Mansion points during a Multiball, they\\'ll be\\nqueued up and awarded to you one at a time with each ramp shot after\\nMultiball ends.  The Bear Kicks will never spot the \"?\" room.  If the \"?\" is\\nlit when you pass a spot Mansion point, then it is wasted.\\n\\nAfter 98 Bear Kicks, every shot to the ramp scores a \"Super Bear Bonus\" of\\n5M.  \"2x Bear Kicks\" doesn\\'t do anything anymore (in fact, it may not even be\\nlit).  Quite nice, really.\\n\\nThing Flips\\n\\nThis is a really cool feature.  If the ball goes through the left left\\ninlane, it lights the middle ramp for Thing Flips.  (The only time this light\\nwon\\'t be on is during any Multiball and if either Thing Multiball is lit.)\\nIf you shoot the middle ramp before it times out, the ball will go on down to\\nthe Thing flipper (\"Let\\'s go, Thing!\").  Here, the game will disable any\\ncontrol YOU have over the flipper and attempt to make the shot to the Swamp\\n(lit for 5x Graveyard now) by itself!  It does this by timing from when the\\nball crosses the opto then calculating when to activate the flipper.  If it\\nmakes the shot (\"Well played, Thing, you\\'re really on the ball!\"), then you\\nget 5x Graveyard.  Otherwise, the ball will hit one of the Swamp Millions\\n(\"Nonono!\" or \"Slow down, Thing.\") targets, and the game will use which one\\nthe ball hit first to judge whether to speed up or slow down the shot.\\n\\nIf the game misses the shot 4 times in a row (that is, doesn\\'t hit the 5x\\nSwamp OR any of the Swamp Millions targets), then it will throw out all of\\nits previous data and start from scratch in trying to realign itself.\\nGenerally, the only time this would happen is if the playfield angle\\ndrastically changed from what it was before.  There is also a \"new location\"\\nsetting the operator can use after moving the game which makes the game throw\\nout all of its Thing Flips data immediately.\\n\\nCombos\\n\\nThere is a 4-way combo in TAFG:  Shoot the middle ramp, then the left loop,\\nthen the left ramp, then the Swamp in quick succession.  Shooting either the\\nfirst 3 (middle ramp->left loop->left ramp) or the last 3 (left loop->left\\nramp->Swamp) will earn you a 3-way combo.  A 3-way combo is worth 5M and a\\n4-way combo is worth 10M.\\n\\n4-way combos are very valuable indeed:  Not only do you get the 10M, but you\\nalso get the 5M from the 3-way combo right before it, a THING star, Adv. X,\\nand 5x Graveyard.  That can easily add up to 25M or more in the long run.\\n\\nExtra Balls\\n\\nExtra balls can be lit in a large number of ways:\\n\\n\\n Bear Kicks (between 6-14 and again at 50)\\n The Mansion room\\n A Cousin It\\'s Hideout award\\n 4 Train Wrecks\\n Start of Tour\\n\\n\\nExtra balls are lit at the Thing ramp/kickout saucer.  By default, all of\\nthem but the Tour extra ball will still be lit if you drain.\\n\\nIf more than one extra ball is lit, and there is a difference in the types\\nthat are lit (i.e. may or may not go away when you lose your ball), then the\\n\"temporary\" extra balls will be awarded first.  So if you have a temporary\\nextra ball lit and a permanent extra ball lit, collect one, then drain,\\nyou\\'ll still have an extra ball lit next ball.\\n\\nWhen you start an extra ball, you may hear:  \"Keep the ball, I have a whole\\nbucketful!\" or \"That\\'s the spirit!  Shoot again!\" or \"Good show old man!\\nShoot again!\"\\n\\nThere is available on TAFG an extra ball buyin.  Here, you may spend one of\\nyour hard-earned credits on ONE extra ball with your score and everything\\nelse the same.  For all intents and purposes, it is just an extra ball.\\nBuying it doesn\\'t seem to give you any advantage or light anything new.  Yes,\\nyou can still get high scores after buying in.  The default is to allow one\\nbuyin, but can be set to 99!\\n\\nAdv. X\\n\\nThe left loop is lit for Adv. X when the ball goes through the right inlane\\n(including coming down off of the middle ramp).  Shooting it advances your\\nbonus multiplier by 1, up to 5x.  The bonus multiplier only affects the\\nMansion room and Bear Kick bonus.  When you have gotten 5x bonus, the \"light\\nadv. x\" light goes off.\\n\\nEnd-of-ball Bonus\\n\\nAs with all other Pat Lawlor games, you are given bonus based on your\\naccomplishments, not ball time or number of switches hit.  Your bonus is:\\n\\n(100K * Bear Kicks + 500K * Mansion rooms) * bonus multiplier + any round\\nbonuses you may have gotten that ball (from Cousin It, Mamushka, or Raise the\\nDead).\\n\\nGetting a bonus OVER 20M that includes a round bonus earns the quote \"Who\\nsays you can\\'t take it with you???\"  You won\\'t get it if you have merely a\\nmultiplied bonus without any rounds, nor will you get it for exactly 20M.\\n\\nStatus Report\\n\\nHolding one flipper button in for a few seconds will bring up the Status\\nReport, assuming there isn\\'t a ball hitting switches somewhere.  Using the\\nother flipper button, you may page through (or just wait and it\\'ll change\\npages automatically) and find out lots of neat stuff about your current game.\\nIt\\'ll tell you the replay value, number of credits left, number of extra\\nballs in reserve (default is no more than 4 balls at a time, BTW), status of\\nGREED and THING, Graveyard value (and whether it\\'s held or not), Train Wrecks\\nand number of hits for the next one, bonus, bonus multiplier, Bear Kicks and\\nwhen the next extra ball is lit, the high scores, and probably other stuff\\nI\\'ve forgotten.  If you wonder about something, it\\'s more than likely in the\\nStatus Report.\\n\\nTilting\\n\\nNot surprisingly, tilting the ball means you lose it along with any bonus you\\nmight have had coming that ball.  (\"Heheheh, you\\'re a funny guy!\")  It is for\\nthis reason that I don\\'t recommend it if you have a 20M Cousin It bonus...\\nThe tilt warning quote is \"Careful!\" for each warning.\\n\\nMansion Rooms\\n\\nThere are 13 rooms in the Addams\\' Mansion, apparently.  Each of them has an\\naward or a round tied to it.  Rooms that start rounds are orange-colored.\\nRooms that just award points are white.  Rooms that start Multiballs are\\ngreen.  The extra ball room is red, and the \"Graveyard at max\" room is\\nyellow.\\n\\nNormal behavior for TAFG is to have the Electric Chair lit at the start of\\nevery ball, though this is difficulty-adjustable.  When the yellow light\\nabove the Electric Chair is on, shoot it or the Swamp kickout to collect the\\ncurrently flashing room.  (You may not be able to collect a room from the\\nSwamp kickout depending on the difficulty setting.)  Doing so awards the room\\n(see descriptions below), leaves it permanently lit, and advances the\\nflashing room to the next one to the right, going up a row to the leftmost\\nroom if the rightmost room on a row was awarded, going back to the bottom\\nleft from the top right.  The \"?\" on top of the Mansion will not start\\nflashing until all other rooms have been collected (lit).  It will skip over\\nrooms already collected, obviously.  If the Chair is unlit, going through the\\nright inlane will light it for about 5 seconds.  Shooting either the left or\\nmiddle ramps will light the Chair permanently.  The Chair will always be lit\\nif the \"?\" is flashing.  Shooting an unlit chair the first time after the\\nlast award will earn you the quote \"It\\'s not plugged in yet.\"  Bear Kicks can\\nalso award rooms (see the Bear Kick section under Gameplay above).\\n\\nIf you drain when the next room to be awarded was either 3M, 6M, or\\n\"Graveyard at max,\" then the flashing room will be advanced to a room that\\nISN\\'T one of those 3.  However, if the only remaining rooms are among those\\n3, then the game will not change the current room.  The pop bumpers advance\\nthe room to the next one available.  A new Mansion (including the start of\\nthe game) will always start with either Cousin It or Mamushka flashing (seems\\nto be a 50-50 chance).\\n\\nThere is a small chance you may find something belonging to Cousin It...  See\\nthe next section.\\n\\n3 Million\\n\\nThis award is actually \"Pugsley\\'s and Wednesday\\'s Trap Door.\"  It awards 3M,\\nthe quote from Tish \"Look, darling,\" and another totally random room whether\\nyou\\'ve already gotten it or not.  It will NOT award the \"?\".  If you haven\\'t\\ngotten the room it gives you already, it\\'ll light it for you, and advance the\\nlit room to the one after the second room.  If you\\'ve already gotten the\\nsecond room, you get the award/round again, and it STILL counts towards your\\nend-of-ball bonus (number-of-rooms-gotten-wise).\\n\\nGraveyard at Max.\\n\\nMakes all of the pop bumpers flashing.  \"Out to the cemetery!  Come on\\neverybody!\"  (See Graveyard under Gameplay for more details on the\\nramifications of this award.)\\n\\nCousin It\\n\\nThis starts a 20-second round in which all switches score a certain value\\n(\"It\\'s Cousin It!\").  You get 1M for starting the round (every time it was\\nstarted, if more than once on that ball).  Cousin It is now flashing on the\\nplayfield, and any time you hit the Cousin It targets, you get an amusing\\npicture of a pinball hitting him in the head, 1M points added to your total,\\nand the switch value increased by 50K (it starts at 200K).  I do not know of\\na limit on the switch value.  If started more than once on a ball, the value\\ngoes back to 200K.  You are not awarded the total until the end-of-ball\\nbonus, so if you tilt, you lose it!\\n\\nMamushka\\n\\nA 20-second round where all switches score a flat 250K (\"Thuuuuuh\\nMaaaaaaamushkaaa!\").  You get 1M each time you start it added to the bonus.\\nIt isn\\'t awarded until the end-of-ball bonus, same deal as Cousin It.\\n\\n6 Million\\n\\nYou get 6M points.  That\\'s it.  Really.  Oh, Gomez says \"Six million!\"  BFD.\\n\\nQuick Multiball\\n\\nLights the Thing ramp/kickout saucer for a 2-ball Multiball (Gomez says\\n\"Quickmultiball!\" really fast).  Shooting it makes Thing pick up the ball and\\ndrop it into the Swamp.  If there is at least one ball still in the trough,\\nthen it\\'ll be served to the plunger.  If all 3 balls (or all the balls in the\\nmachine) are in the Swamp, then you\\'ll get a Swamp kickout warning from the\\ndisplay and 2 balls will be kicked out.  If you get to plunge, then the\\nsecond ball is kicked out after you hit a switch.\\n\\nThe goal for Quick Multiball is to shoot the vault (which is now open) for\\nVault Jackpots.  The starting value is 5M.  Shooting the vault for the\\nJackpot OR shooting the middle ramp increases the Jackpot by 1M up to a\\nmaximum of 10M.  The Power is active during this Multiball, as with any other\\nMultiball.  Quick Multiball ends when at least one ball drains.  :)\\n\\nThe default is to let this award stay on between balls, but on hard and 5-\\nball settings, Quick Multiball turns off after you drain.\\n\\nFester\\'s Tunnel Hunt\\n\\nThis is a 20-second round where you are supposed to search the 3 different\\nholes for treasure or something (\"Look, darling, just what we\\'ve been\\nsearching for.\" from Tish).  The three shots are the Electric Chair, the\\nVault (which will be revealed if it isn\\'t already), and the Swamp/Swamp\\nkickout.  The first shot (doesn\\'t matter which of the 3) earns 5M and\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s in here?\"  The second (of the remaining 2 shots) is worth 10M\\nand \"There it is.\"  The last shot is worth 15M and \"Just what we\\'ve been\\nsearching for.\"  If you don\\'t make all 3 in 20 seconds, well, nothing BAD\\nhappens, the round just ends.\\n\\n(Super) Seance\\n\\nSeance is a 20-second round in which you are supposed to shoot any 3 ramps\\n(either the middle or left ones).  \"Knock 3 times!\"  The first shot is worth\\n5M (\"That\\'s once.\"), the second shot is 10M (\"Twice.\"), and the third is 15M\\n(\"Thrice!  Well done!\").  The real kicker is that the Power is active during\\nthis round.  :(  The replay knocker (it\\'s a lot softer in TAF and TAFG than\\nnormal games, BTW) is knocked one time, two times, and three times depending\\non the shot.\\n\\nDuring Seance, the ball always goes to the Thing flipper from the middle ramp\\nunless you got it right at the end of the round on the grace period or Thing\\nMultiball is lit.\\n\\nThere is a chance (not sure, but it seems to be 25%-50%) that instead of a\\nSeance, you\\'ll get a Super Seance.  Same deal, except the shots are worth\\n10M, 15M, and 20M.  This is really worth going for.  It may also pop up\\nduring the Tour (same probability).\\n\\n9 Million\\n\\nThis is not unlike the 6 Million award.\\n\\nThing Multiball\\n\\nSimply labeled \"Thing\" on the playfield, this room starts a 15-second\\ncountdown to get the ball to the Thing ramp/kickout saucer (\"Look,\\ndarling!\").  The display changes to show you 15M points which counts down at\\nthe standard rate of 1M/second down to a minimum of 3M.  When it reaches 3M,\\nyou have about 3 more seconds to try and shoot for it.  If you do get it,\\nThing will pick up the ball (\"And that\\'s not all!\"), and a 2-ball Multiball\\nwill start exactly like Quick Multiball.  However, the value of the Vault\\nJackpots is the value at which you shot the Thing ramp and cannot be\\nincreased.\\n\\nThing Multiball can be operator-set to start at anywhere from 10M-20M.  If\\nit\\'s set lower, you have less time (always 3-5 seconds after it hits a value\\nof 3M); likewise, if it\\'s set higher you get more time.  This is because the\\ncountdown rate (1M/sec) cannot be changed.\\n\\nWhen Thing Multiball is lit, the middle ramp will always feed to the right\\ninlane regardless of Thing Flips or Seance.  All returns to normal after you\\ncollect the value or it times out.\\n\\nRaise the Dead\\n\\nThis is a dreaded pop bumper round, though since this is not a DE game, it is\\nlivable.  \"Raise the dead!  Out to the cemetary, come on everybody!\"  The\\nGraveyard picture (of all the graves) takes over the display with a number on\\neach grave representing the number of hits of that bumper needed to raise the\\ndead person from that grave.  Simple observation will show you which grave\\nrepresents which bumper.  It\\'s roughly perspectively equivalent to their\\npositions on the playfield.  (Got that?)\\n\\nEach bumper hit adds 100K to the total (2M each time the round is started)\\nfor 30 seconds.  Hitting each bumper the required number of times (which is\\nusually 4, but can be set from 3 to 9) adds 3M to the total.  This is end-of-\\nball bonus, BTW!  It is potentially a very lucrative round if you can get the\\nball into the bumpers...  Nothing special for raising them all, except that\\nyou\\'ll have at least 19M points.  After a bumper has been \"raised\", it still\\nscores 100K for the rest of the round.\\n\\nThe bumpers all flash at the start of the round, and the fewer hits a bumper\\nneeds to be \"raised\" the faster it flashes.  It stops flashing after being\\n\"raised.\"  If everyone is raised, the round ends.\\n\\nLight Extra Ball\\n\\nYOU figure it out...  \"Get the extra ball!\"\\n\\nTour the Mansion!\\n\\nTour the Mansion!  Only available after all other rooms have been collected,\\nthis is the Wizard Bonus of TAFG.  It can NOT be started by spotting from\\nBear Kicks.  When it is lit, the Electric Chair is automatically lit.\\nCollecting it does the following:\\n\\n\\n Turns off all the Mansion lights\\n 50M (\"Fifffffty millll-yun!\")\\n Marks off 3M, 6M, and 9M\\n Lights the special (\"Look, darling!\")\\n Marks off Quick Multiball\\n Awards the \"Graveyard at max\" room (and marks it off)\\n Awards the \"Light extra ball\" room (and marks it off), which must be\\n        collected during that ball or it goes away.\\n Goes through the rest of the rooms one-by-one starting at the bottom right\\n        and stepping up the path laid out by the marked-off rooms to the upper left.\\n        If you still can\\'t figure out the order, it is:  Mamushka, Cousin It, Seance,\\n        Tunnel Hunt, Raise the Dead, and Thing Multiball.  The next round is started\\n        as soon as the previous one ends (Mamushka is started right away).  Any\\n        rounds that were going continue just fine, except Thing Multiball gets\\n        cancelled and Mamushka\\'s timer is RESET to 20 seconds (instead of having 20\\n        seconds added to the timer).\\n\\n\\nRight before the first room is awarded, when the display goes back to the\\nMansion for the room zoom-in, the Mansion picture is briefly mutilated for\\nsome unknown reason.  Just a display bug.\\n\\nDuring the Tour, no GREED letters may be spotted.  Also, if the lock was\\nalready lit, you can\\'t lock balls.\\n\\nIf you go through everything, then at the end of Thing Multiball, everything\\nis solidly lit and the Mansion is effectively out of play for the rest of\\nthat ball.  GREED or the status of the locks are restored to what it was when\\nyou started the Tour.  Since you can\\'t get any more Mansion rooms now, just\\nabout the only major thing to go for is Multiball...\\n\\nCousin It\\'s Hideout\\n\\nThe game can be set to give a certain number of extra awards per mansion.\\nThese are from Cousin It\\'s Hideout, and it is just a random bonus with awards\\nas described below:\\n\\n\\nCousin It\\'s Hat5M\\n   (Rabbit pops out of hat)\\nCousin It\\'s Hair Brush5M\\n   (It strokes his hair)\\nCousin It\\'s Sunglasses7M\\n   (Cool shades!)\\nCousin It\\'s Car Keys8M\\n   (It drives his car onto the screen from the left)\\nCousin It\\'s Hair Spray10M\\n   (Huge spritzes of spray)\\nCousin It\\'s Hair Dryer15M\\n   (Hair flys all over the place)\\nCousin It\\'s Wristwatch20M\\n   (It displays his huge watch on his left arm)\\nCousin It\\'s Gold Chain25M\\n   (It schwinging his chain)\\nCousin It\\'s Gold PinballLight extra ball\\n   (Tosses a ball in the air a couple of times)\\nCousin It\\'s Bag of GoldLight special\\n   (Picks up coins from the bag and lets them fall back in)\\n\\n\\nThe range \"per mansion\" is from 1-4, and the default is 2.  However, after\\ngoing through 1 or 2 mansions, I never got any extra items.  It may be just\\nfor the first mansion.  :(\\n\\nThere are only a couple of rules that I\\'m aware of...  It doesn\\'t appear that\\nyou will get a Hideout for Pugsley\\'s and Wednesday\\'s Trap Door (3M room),\\nthough you may from the room awarded after that.  You can get Hideouts from\\nrooms spotted by Bear Kicks just as if you had shot it, and you can also get\\na Hideout from the Cousin It round (same possibility as any other room).\\n\\nI also encountered an interesting bug:  I got Cousin It\\'s Car Keys at the\\nstart of a Tour once!  That was weird, but then for each room I went through\\n(drained after starting 3 rounds), it gave me the animation again for it.\\nThis has since been confirmed by other people, and it turns out that you do\\nNOT keep getting the award though it keeps showing you the animation.\\n\\nMultiball\\n\\nMultiball can be a lot of fun on TAFG.  The way you light it is by spelling\\nGREED.  Each time you hit the Bookcase, you get the next letter in GREED.\\nFor the first Multiball, the start of each ball will spot you the next letter\\nin GREED (so you basically start the game with G lit).  Also (for the first\\nMultiball), tilting the ball will spot you another GREED letter for reasons\\nbeyond my comprehension.  Upon completion of GREED (alternates between\\n\"Greeeeeeeed\" and \"There, see what greed will get you?\"), the Bookcase swings\\nopen revealing the Vault.\\n\\nAt times you may get really lucky, and the ball will fly into the Vault even\\nthough the Bookcase is still closed.  Well, this situation was anticipated,\\nand should it happen, the game will immediately spell GREED, open the Vault,\\nand lock that ball!  \"Dirty pool, old man...  I like it!\"  I thought this was\\nthe coolest thing I\\'d ever seen a game do until R&B (a DE game of all things)\\ncame out with its \"Good boy, Sherman\" award.  :)\\n\\nAt this point, the lock(s) is(are) lit (any shot with a green flashing light\\nabove it).  For the first Multiball, you may lock balls at the Thing ramp/\\nkickout saucer (adjustable).  For the second lock on your first Multiball,\\nyou may also lock the ball in the Swamp.  After 2 balls have been locked, you\\nmay start Multiball from either of the shots with a flashing red light above\\nit - the Vault (\"Not the Bermuda Triangle!\") or from the Electric Chair (\"Now\\nyou\\'ve done it.\" the first time and \"It has to warm up...  So it can KILL\\nyou!\" the second).  The Electric Chair will only start Multiball the first 2\\ntimes (adjustable), and the Swamp kickout shot will NOT work to start.  I\\nmight point out that when start Multiball is lit, the Power is active...\\n\\nThe start of Multiball is probably the biggest buildup of any game yet...\\nAll the playfield flashers go off and get lit row by row alternating every\\nother lamp while the sound gets louder and louder and the flashing gets\\nfaster and faster.  Finally, Gomez yells \"SHOW-TIME!\", there are 3 more\\nbooms, and Multiball starts.\\n\\nThe balls are kicked out one at a time - first one from the Swamp kickout,\\nsecond one from the Swamp kickout or Electric Chair (depending on whether or\\nnot you started Multiball from the Chair (i.e. there\\'s a ball there)), and\\nthe last one from the Swamp kickout.\\n\\nThe object now is to shoot either the Train for Jackpot or the left ramp for\\nthe Super Jackpot.  It\\'s an either/or situation, so chances are you\\'ll want\\nto go for the Super Jackpot.  The Super Jackpot is a double Jackpot the first\\nMultiball, and a triple Jackpot for each Multiball after that.\\n\\nSo, just how much IS the Jackpot worth?  Good question.  But, we seem to\\nfinally have an answer!  On L-1 and L-2 ROMs, it is worth either 5 or 15M.\\nIf you\\'ve had 6 or more skill shots (may just be skill shot attempts), then\\nit is 5M.  5 or fewer and it is 15M.  On L-3 ROMs, the jackpot is worth 10M\\nfor starting it from the Electric Chair, and 15M for starting it from the\\nVault.\\n\\nWhatever the starting value, each hit of the Bookcase or each shot of the\\nmiddle ramp will increase the Jackpot by 1M, up to a maximum of 25M.\\n\\nCollecting the Jackpot keeps the value of the Jackpot the same.  Collecting a\\nSuper Jackpot sets the value of the next Jackpot at 10M.  In either case, the\\nBookcase will reopen, and you need to shoot the Vault to relight the Super\\nJackpot.  (You don\\'t get to shoot for the Jackpot after either one is\\ncollected the first time, but who cares?)\\n\\nIf you get Dirty Pool during Multiball (the ball goes into the Vault, which\\nis closed because the Jackpots are lit), then you are awarded the Super\\nJackpot, the value is reset to 10M, and the Super Jackpot stays lit on the\\nramp.  Cool!  Oh, and the Jackpot goes away if it was lit.\\n\\nHearing Gomez yell \"Triiiiple Jackpot!!\" is very cool and very satisfying.\\nYou MUST hear this.  :)\\n\\nGomez says something near the start of Multiball during the initial flail-\\naround period, but I\\'ve never understood it.  If you get a Jackpot or Super\\nJackpot and still have more than one ball on the playfield, Gomez says\\n\"There\\'s more where that came from!\"\\n\\nIf through some vast misfortune you don\\'t get a single Jackpot, all is not\\nlost.  You get a 20-second period in which you can shoot the Thing ramp/\\nkickout saucer for a 2-ball Multiball restart.  Thing will pick up the ball,\\nand you will get a ball served to the plunger lane.  The Jackpot value\\nremains what it was when the 2nd ball drained.  Be absolutely sure that this\\nball makes it off of the plunger ramp, because the Jackpots are lit right\\naway and this is an easy opportunity to make one.  If you miss the skill\\nshot, but the ball still makes it to the upper right flipper, then you can\\nshoot either shot before the other ball has a chance to come out.  If you\\nmake the skill shot, generally there is just enough time for the other ball\\nto get kicked out before being awarded a Jackpot.  If you don\\'t make the\\nMultiball restart, Gomez says \"Sorry, old man.\"\\n\\nWhen Multiball finally ends, the Bookcase closes back up if it was open and\\neverything begins anew.  However, after the first Multiball, no more GREED\\nletters will be given out for free and you must lock balls in the Vault.\\n\\nIf, during a multiplayer game, someone steals your locked balls from you, you\\nmay simply drop a ball into the Swamp from the plunge to relock it.  A very\\nnice feature indeed.  Also, at the end of the game, any locked balls are\\nkicked out into the trough (adjustable).\\n\\nTips/Tricks/Strategies\\n\\nAs soon as you plunge the ball into the skill shot, you immediately have a\\nchoice to make.  Do I shoot the left ramp?  The Train?  Maybe slam it into\\nthe Bookcase instead...  Generally, the best thing to do is shoot the ramp.\\nYou can hit the Bookcase from either of the bottom flippers if you want to go\\nfor Multiball, and Train Wrecks usually happen more or less by accident as\\nthe game goes on.  Generally, the ONLY time I\\'ll shoot the Train is if the\\nGraveyard value is very high (so that it\\'ll carry over to the next ball) or\\nif I\\'m very close to getting the extra ball from the 4th Train Wreck.\\nBesides, shooting the left ramp increases the value for the rest of the ball\\nand gives you a letter in THING.\\n\\nAs for deciding whether to go for the Mansion or Multiball, the same kind of\\nlogic generally applies.  Mansion rooms are much harder to shoot than the\\nBookcase, and generally the ball will wander up and hit the Bookcase a few\\ntimes by inself anyway.  After a Tour, of course, you CAN\\'T go for the\\nMansion so you might as well go for Multiball.\\n\\nThe 2 most important shots to master are probably the Electric Chair and the\\nvault.  They can be tricky but generally aren\\'t that difficult.  Most of the\\nother shots are pretty easy (even that left ramp is much easier than it\\nlooks).  Also extremely important is to learn how the balls come out of the\\nChair and the Swamp kickout.  Can you catch them?  Can you let the ball\\nbounce over to the other flipper for an easy shot somewhere else?  Is it\\nreally fast?  Will it run into the slingshot on the way down?  Answering\\nthose questions is key in keeping good ball control.\\n\\nWhen you light the locks for Multiball, it\\'s generally a good idea to go\\nahead and get it out of the way.\\n\\nDuring Multiball, always go for the Super Jackpot.  The only time it\\'s\\nmathematically to your advantage to shoot the Jackpot is when you\\'re on your\\nfirst Multiball (Super Jackpot = 2x) and the Jackpot value is >20M.  You can\\nfigure out why if you want, but the difference is small enough that you might\\nas well shoot for the Super Jackpot anyway.  Besides, it could wind up NOT\\nbeing to your advantage, but I don\\'t want to get into all that now...  Email\\nme if you really care.  :)\\n\\nIf you\\'re not sure what to do when the ball is at the upper right flipper,\\nshoot the left ramp.  The only exceptions are described above and when Cousin\\nIt is running.  It\\'s worth nailing It a few times near the beginning of the\\nround, but when there\\'s only about 5 seconds left, just shoot the ramp.  The\\nexception to THAT rule is if you are in Multiball.  During Multiball, any\\ntimed round has the timer paused any time ANY ball is in a hole or kickout\\nsaucer or something.  This can lead to insanely high Cousin It scores (like\\n45M), as well as good Mamushka scores.  High Cousin Its are much more likely\\nif you take the time to nail him during Multiball, though.  One more\\nexception:  If the Super Jackpot is lit, shoot for that at all costs.  One\\nmeasly hit on It is not going to make up the difference in the long run no\\nmatter what!\\n\\nFor either of the frenzy rounds (Cousin It and Mamushka and especially Raise\\nthe Dead), it makes sense that the best place for the ball to be is in the\\npop bumpers.  This is just about the only reason to learn the right loop\\nshot.  You can also plunge a ball directly into the bumpers after locking a\\nball, but you should only do this when Multiball is ready to start or the only\\nplace to lock the ball is the Vault, and when the round is Raise the Dead.\\nOtherwise, it\\'s usually worth going for the skill shot instead.  (For\\nMamushka, you need 20 bumper hits to make up a 5M skill shot, and the chances\\nof that happening are not great, though it could.)\\n\\nFor Quick Multiball, a good idea is to jack up the Jackpot value to 10M by\\nshooting the middle ramp a few times first.  Then just plug away at the\\nVault!\\n\\nThere\\'s not much to say about Tunnel Hunt...  One thing I like to do is to\\nflail the ball directly into the Vault from the Electric Chair kickout (not a\\nhard shot once you get used to it), then flail it into the Electric Chair\\nfrom the Swamp Kickout, then catch the ball from the Chair and try to shoot\\nthe Swamp kickout.  If you light Thing Flips and you haven\\'t gotten the Swamp\\nyet, by all means shoot the ramp and hopefully Thing will make the Swamp for\\nyou (you DO get credit for it during Tunnel Hunt).\\n\\nSeance is definitely tricky.  The normal Seance is often not worth the\\nfrustration of dealing with the Power, though this is certainly machine-\\ndependant.  You can\\'t just hold onto the ball, though.  Generally the Seance\\ntimer will stop after the Status Report starts showing on the screen.\\nHowever, this often turns the Power off until you hit another target.  This\\ngives you a nice clean shot at the middle ramp.  (You can turn the Power off\\nin this way just about any time, so you can give yourself a clean shot at\\nstarting Multiball as well.)  If you get a Super Seance, though, it is\\ndefinitely worth going for, since the total for finishing it would get you\\n45M.  When you shoot either ramp, it\\'s generally OK to NOT shoot for 5x\\nGraveyard and just let the ball dribble into the inlanes.  But be careful\\nhere!  It\\'s also quite possible that the ball will bounce right into the\\noutlane.  If you\\'re really lucky, you\\'ll shoot the ramp, the ball will go\\nthrough the \"light 2x Bear Kicks\" inlane, you\\'ll shoot the ramp, the ball\\nwill go through the \"light Thing Flips\" inlane, you\\'ll shoot the ramp, and\\nThing\\'ll make the shot and you\\'ll get 5x Graveyard, too.\\n\\nFor Thing Multiball, the best thing to do is to let the ball bounce over to\\nthe right flipper and shoot the Thing ramp right away.  Alternatively, if you\\ncan\\'t bounce it over, flail the ball up the middle ramp (which will ALWAYS\\ndeliver the ball to the right inlane while the Thing timer is counting down)\\nthen shoot the Thing ramp.  Either way shoot net you over 10M easily if you\\ndon\\'t miss.  The middle ramp->Thing ramp combo generally gives you around\\n12.5M and the bounce-over method generally give you 13.8M.  If when you start\\nThing Multiball the value is pretty low (like below 5M), then I concentrate\\non hitting things other than the Vault.  For example, this is a great time to\\nshoot the left ramp and build up your Million Plus value quite a bit, which\\ncan easily surpass the Thing Jackpot value.\\n\\nDuring Raise the Dead, if you\\'re ever given the ball at the plunger lane and\\nthere\\'s no easy lock (skill shot or Swamp), then launch it to the bumpers.\\nChances are good that you\\'ll get a couple of graves which will give you\\naround 7M points.  Raise the Dead is probably the most easily ignored round\\nin the whole game because the ball often doesn\\'t make it to the bumpers by\\nitself, and no shot really puts the ball there except for the (generally\\nuseless) right loop.  However, Raise the Dead, if actually shot for, can\\neasily be worth more than Cousin It and Mamushka combined.\\n\\nIf THING is lit, but so is Multiball, make sure you collect THING first.  You\\ncan\\'t get it during Multiball, and since your main goal is to shoot the left\\nramp, you\\'ll miss out on letters for the next THING you would have otherwise\\ngotten.  It\\'s pretty easy to go through all 5 letters during one Multiball.\\n\\nIf something is lit at the Thing ramp and you have a ball at the plunger, be\\nsure to err on the launch-too-hard side.  This is because hopefully if the\\nball goes beyond the kickout saucer, it won\\'t go TOO far and you can let the\\nball drain silently and get another chance.  This is especially important if\\nan extra ball is lit there.\\n\\nKnow what\\'s going to happen when you\\'re about to spot a room.  For example,\\nif Thing is flashing and you shoot the 15th Bear Kick, then you should shoot\\nthe Thing ramp before the room is even awarded to you and you instantly get\\n15M points.  Also, during the Tour, when Raise the Dead is about to come to a\\nclose, hold the ball on the right flipper and wait for it to end, then shoot\\nthe Thing ramp for a very high Thing value.\\n\\nThere ARE cows in TAFG.  :)  The designer credits are in there as well.\\n\\nWhen to use the buyin?  Well, if you\\'re really close to the Tour or you have\\nan extra ball (or more) lit or if you\\'re getting bored and want to get rid of\\ncredits, then go ahead and use it.  The button is on the middle right of the\\nfront of the cabinet.  Otherwise, hit start or both flippers together to\\nabort it.\\n\\nContributors\\n\\nSpecial thanks to...\\n\\n\\n Jon Biavati\\n Mark Phaedrus\\n Mark Valentine\\n David Stewart\\n\\n\\nThe end.

And I may end up liking it more\\nthan Frankenstein.\\n\\nIt has a very crowded playfield (almost all shots are no more\\nthan midway up the playfield), excellent backglass, playfield,\\nand cabinet art, terrific dots, and decent sound (save\\nfor the repetitive quotes).\\n\\nMost of the shots are quite narrow and somewhat difficult,\\nespecially from fast-moving inlane balls.  This, combined\\nwith how often the post comes up, makes gameplay pretty much\\ncatch-and-shoot.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of things to do on A13: play the missions (modes),\\ngo for standard or 13-ball multiball, and completing the\\nOdyssey\\'s flight back to a Splashdown on Earth.\\n\\nThe theme is very well implemented into game play.\\n\\nThe DMD instructions and playfield light indicators are\\ntop-notch as far as letting you know what you\\'re supposed\\nto do.  Your score is almost always on the display.\\n\\n\\nDESIGN CREDITS\\n\\n\\n Game Software - Lonnie Ropp\\n Display Software - Orin Day\\n Mechanical Design - Bob Hurtadu\\n Music and Sounds - Brian Schmidt\\n To be completed.\\n\\n\\n\\nVITAL STATS OF THE MACHINE I USED\\n\\n\\n Serial #: 127937\\n Manufacturing Date: 12/27/95\\n CPU ROM: 5.01\\n Barcode : 675081?\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAYFIELD - THE BOTTOM\\n\\n\\n 2 flippers, standard.   I think they feel way better than\\nthe ones on recent WMS/Bally games I\\'ve played.\\n\\n Slingshots, standard.   I have a tough time doing slingshot\\npasses for some reason.  On the other hand, bounce passes seem\\nto be particularly easy.\\n\\n Inlanes.  not standard, as the inlane switches are lower\\nin the lane, parallel to the flippers.   This makes hitting\\nthem more easy, and this is important, because hitting them\\nlights the corresponding Orbit shot for a few seconds.\\nMore on Orbits and Advancing the Spacecraft later.\\n\\n Outlanes (1M)  standard, and -no- kickback!  Foam tape covers\\nthe inlane/outlane divider, and I don\\'t have much trouble\\nsaving balls from the outlanes.  Most outlane drains were\\nfrom slingshot bounces.\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAYFIELD - THE SHOTS AND ONE-BALL, NON-MODE RULES\\n\\nThis is a little different format than most rule sheets; I\\'m\\ngoing ahead and including the rules governing each shot in one-ball,\\nnon-mode play.\\n\\nFrom lower left clockwise...\\n\\n\\n D-O-C-K standup targets.   Complete them to light\\nMystery at the Spinner Lane saucer.  \\n\\n Left orbit.   Pretty easy from a caught ball; harder from\\na moving one.  Advances Spacecraft when lit (solidly at the\\nstart of a game, for a brief time after hitting the opposing inlane\\nrollover).  Usually the ball goes around\\nand out the right orbit entrance, but it can be diverted onto\\nback to the left inlane via a short ramp and wireform.\\n\\nAnything lit at either orbit is collected by hitting the switch in the orbit;\\nthe ball does not have to go all the way around to the other orbit or reach\\nthe top rollovers.  In fact, a slow ball that hits the switch a 2nd time\\non the way back down will credit 2 orbit shots!\\n\\nAn unlit orbit is worth around 5-9M points.\\n\\n Food standup.   Halfway up the playfield, between the\\nLeft orbit and Spinner lane entrances.  Scores a small # of points.\\n\\n Spinner lane.   Leads to a saucer in the bumper area\\nat the top of the playfield.  The spinner scores from\\n250K to 2M per spin, depending on its value, which is increased\\nby the \"13\" top lanes.  Mystery is lit here, but it must be\\ncollected at the top saucer.  This shot is quite easily backhandable.\\n\\n Rocket ramp.   A short metal ramp with a plastic rocket on\\ntop.  When hit hard enough, a magnet grabs it under the rocket,\\nand releases it back down the ramp toward the flippers.\\nA big post pops up between the flippers when this happens,\\nso your best thing to do is to let the ball hit the post and\\nthen catch it in a flipper.\\n\\nThere\\'s an LED (yay!) under the Rocket ramp that tells you\\nhow many shots are needed to start multiball (regular or\\n13-ball), and provides other info in some modes and MBs.\\nWhen the LED reads 1, the next shot to the Rocket starts\\nMB.\\n\\nThe first MB takes 3 Rocket shots to start.  Successive MBs take\\n2 more (5, 7, ...)\\n\\n Battery standup targets: 4 of them, yellow, facing to the\\nright.   At the exit of the bumper area, and a ball leaving the\\nbumpers will usually hit one of them.   The manual mentions\\nsomething about being able to get an extra ball from hitting them\\nenough, but I\\'ve never seen any behavior from them except in the\\nVoltage Mission.\\n\\n \"Battery Lane\": a gap to the right of the Battery standups\\nthat leads to and from the bumpers. \\n\\n M-O-O-N standups, facing the flippers.   The leftmost\\none starts out flashing, hit that to light it and flash\\nthe next one.  When you complete the sequence, Shoot The Moon\\n(see its section) is lit at the ramp for a hurry-up.  The sequence\\nalso lights Super Jackpot in regular multiball.\\n\\n Blastoff ramp.   A shallow blue ramp. I haven\\'t been able to\\nbackhand it.  Has a diverter that sends the ball to either the\\nleft or right inlane.  The diverter is not machine-controllable\\nand just switches from side to side after each made ramp shot.\\n\\nA sign over the ramp has two lamps: a yellow one that indicates\\nwhen a BLASTOFF letter is available, and a red one that\\nis lit when the Shoot The Moon hurryup is available.  The yellow\\nlamp is lit at the start of a ball.\\n\\nA letter in BLASTOFF can be collected via a combo when the\\nyellow lamp is not lit.  The combo is either ramp -> ramp or\\nramp -> left orbit -> ramp, depending on the current position\\nof the diverter.\\n\\nHitting the Blastoff ramp is an easy way to light an Orbit\\nto Advance the Spacecraft.\\n\\nThere\\'s a big plastic moon in the \"kink\" of the ramp that\\nhas a magnet that can grab the ball and rotate it around to a big\\nhole beside of the ramp.  This happens whenever the ramp is\\nhit with the yellow lamp lit in one-ball, non-mode play.\\n\\n Water standup.   Like the Food standup.\\n\\n Right orbit.   When lit, Advances the Spacecraft.  Like the left\\norbit, easy from a caught ball, harder from a moving one.\\n\\n Mission start lane.   A short lane which leads to a saucer\\n(like the ones on T2 and NF, but on the right).  A red\\nlamp is above it, which indicates when Start Mission is\\navailable.  This is where you collect lit Extra Balls.\\nAfter hitting this shot, the post comes up for a few seconds,\\nso the best thing to do is again to let the ball hit the\\npost and then catch it.\\n\\nThis is a surprisingly difficult shot, and part of the reason\\nis that hard shots to the saucer often bounce out.  This\\nis most unfortunate.\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAYFIELD - TOP LANE AND BUMPER AREA\\n\\nPlunged balls head for the 2 top rollover lanes, labeled\\n\"1\" and \"3\". Completing \"13\" advances the pop bumper\\nand spinner values by 250K, to a max of 2M (they both\\nstart at 250K).  After a ball goes thru\\na lane it enters the pop bumper area.\\n\\nOccasionally a ball bypasses the top left diverter and goes down\\nthe left orbit.  This gives credit for anything lit at the left\\norbit.  This also sometimes happens for the right orbit.\\n\\n\\n Pop Bumper area.  an enclosed area with three -strong-\\npop bumpers.  The ball can bounce around in here for\\nquite a while.  Get here from the \"13\" rollovers, or from\\na shot to the Spinner lane.  Bumpers score a value of 250K\\nat the start, which increases by 250K after completing \"13\".\\n\\nThe bumpers also increase the Shoot the Moon value, by\\ntheir current value.\\n\\n Top saucer.  most Spinner Lane shots end up here.  The ball\\ncan also bounce in here from the bumpers.  Awards Mystery\\nwhen it\\'s lit at the Spinner Lane.  Displays the Shoot The Moon\\nvalue when hit.\\n\\nThe ball always exits the bumper area thru the \"Battery Lane\",\\nunless it pops back up a \"13\" rollover and down an Orbit.\\n\\n\\n\\nSELECTING GAME MODE\\n\\nAfter starting a game, you have a choice of \"Regular\" or\\n\"Novice\" mode.  \"Regular\" is the normal 3-ball arrangement.\\n\"Novice\" is timed play; the player has 2 minutes when any\\ndrained balls are autoplunged, and after the 2 minutes expires,\\nthe game is over when the ball(s) on the field drains.\\n\\nYou can start a game in \"League\" mode by holding the left flipper\\nbutton in while starting a game, and \"Wizard\" mode by holding\\nthe right flipper button in.  The only special thing I\\'ve\\nseen about either of these is that in \"League\" the sums of the\\nscores of players 1 & 2 and 3 & 4 are also shown on the display.\\n\\n\\n SKILL SHOT\\n\\nNo skill is involved.  Pick one of three awards: Start Mission,\\nMystery (see the available Mystery awards below), and either Multiball\\nCountdown (reduces the MB LED Countdown value by 1) or\\n13 Million (if the MB LED is 1 already, or if BLASTOFF is lit).  The ball\\nheads for the \"13\" rollovers, and either enters the bumper\\narea or goes down either the left or right orbit lane.\\n\\n\\nMYSTERY\\n\\nCollect the Mystery either with the Skill Shot or at the\\ntop saucer.  Possible Mystery awards (that I\\'ve seen) are:\\n\\n\\n         2 Orbits\\n         BLASTOFF letter\\n         Hold Bonus\\n         Double Bonus\\n         13 Million\\n         50M / Washing Machine\\n         Mystery 3-Ball\\n         M-Ball Ready\\n         (others?)\\n\\n\\nThe first 5 are the most likely ones.  Washing Machine (har, har)\\ncomes up every few games, and is worth 50M.  The manual mentions\\nothers I haven\\'t seen, like \"13 Ball Play\", \"Extra Ball\",\\nand \"Light Special\".\\n\\nMystery 3-ball starts, well, a 3-ball multiball where the spinner\\nis worth a \"mysterious\" amount of points.  Seems like it was 50M.\\n\\nThe 50M award was called \"Washing Machine\" in earlier (2.05, at least)\\nROMs.\\n\\n\\nSHOOT THE MOON\\n\\nWhen the M-O-O-N targets are completed, Shoot the Moon is lit\\nat the Blastoff ramp.  It is a hurry-up shot, but counts down\\n-very- slowly, so you don\\'t really have to hurry.  You -do-\\nwant to collect before losing the ball, tho :).  If you don\\'t\\ncollect it, it resets to 20M.\\n\\nThe Shoot the Moon value can be very large in a long game.\\nI\\'ve had it over 400M in a 4B game.\\n\\n\\nORBITS AND ADVANCING THE SPACECRAFT\\n\\nOooh, this is important.  Collect an Orbit and Advance the\\nSpacecraft by hitting the left or right orbit when they\\'re lit.\\nThey\\'re lit for a few seconds by the inlane switches.\\nThe game starts with both orbits lit solidly.  I\\'m not sure\\nhow the \"2 Orbits\" Mystery award affects the Orbits when they\\'re\\nlit solidly; I think I\\'ve had them both stay lit and go out.\\n\\nA little of my strategy: since the Spacecraft modes are so lucrative,\\nI\\'ll pick Mystery with the Skill Shot until I get the 2 Orbits\\naward.  Then I\\'ll pick Start Mission.\\n\\nCollecting Orbits advances your spacecraft around the moon and\\nback to earth.  Your progress is displayed (very attractively)\\nin the center of the playfield.  Many awards are given from\\nthe Orbits:\\n\\n\\n Orbits.  Lights Video Mode.  Start Video Mode at the right saucer.\\nDuring VM, your goal is to safely land the Landing Module on the\\nmoon.  The left and right flipper buttons fire the Module\\'s thrusters\\nleft and right, and hitting both buttons fires the thrusters up.\\n\\nTurning the plunger stops the Module\\'s lateral movement, which\\nmakes this mode trivially easy to complete.  I have no earthly\\nidea why Wizard mode doesn\\'t disable this.  Just go right and\\nstop when you\\'re above your landing spot; piece of cake.\\n\\nIf you do this.  The resolution of the \"distant\" animation isn\\'t\\ndetailed enough to guarantee a safe landing.  The \"closeup\" animation\\nis, however, and you should find a \"key\" dot in the animation to\\nmake sure you land safely.  I line up a column of dots in the background\\nwith the 4 dots in the right \"foot\" of the spacecraft; if the column\\ngoes thru the \"foot\" I know I\\'ll land safely.\\n\\nVideo Mode is worth 50M/109M/84M for landing in the left/center/right\\nareas, and 25M for crashing.\\n\\n Orbits.  Starts Power Down.  The clock is running, and 6 shots are\\nworth 50 - 60 - 70 - 80 - 90 - 90M.  You get 10M for starting Power\\nDown.  So the completion total is a nice 450M.\\n\\n Orbits.  Starts Power Up.  The clock is running again.  This time,\\none shot at a time is lit.  Hit it to collect points and light\\nthe next shot.  The scoring is the same as in Power Down.\\n\\n2 Orbits.  Starts Splashdown.  This is a timed multiball where\\nthe Orbits score Jackpots, apparently; I haven\\'t gotten here yet.\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons I love the Orbit rules is that they reward inlane\\npasses, which are not at all hard to do on my machine.  I don\\'t\\nthink I\\'ve ever had one lead to a drain, either.\\n\\n\\nMISSIONS\\n\\nStart a mission from the Skill Shot or by hitting the right saucer when\\nlit.  The right saucer is always lit (in one-ball, non-mode play)\\nuntil Master Alarm is reached; after that you have to hit the\\nspinner to light the saucer.\\n\\nThere are 9 Missions; after doing all of them, Master Alarm is\\nlit at the right saucer.\\n\\nYou can lock in a lit (flashing) Mission by turning the\\nplunger handle.  But the Mission you locked becomes unlocked\\nwhen you plunge your next ball.  So be careful.  The Missions rotate\\nby pop bumper hits (maybe other shots too).\\n\\nWhile Missions are running, nothing else is available except\\nhitting the Rocket ramp to advance towards Multiball (and this isn\\'t\\navailable during Rocket 2 Ball), and collecting a BLASTOFF letter\\nif lit.  I don\\'t know if Combos are still available.\\n\\nThe Missions are for the most fun to complete.  They\\'re roughly balanced:\\nmost score 100-150M except Manual Burn and Under Volt, which can be worth\\n400-700M (if played correctly) !\\n\\nI wish there was a compelling reason to actually complete them (maybe\\nthere is in Splashdown ?) other than the points you get from\\nthe Mission.\\n\\nAll Missions have a starting value of 10M.  This is included\\nin the total Mission score.\\n\\nThe 9 Missions:\\n\\n\\n ORBITER.  The left orbit is lit for a value of 50M, which counts\\ndown rather quickly to 10M.  Make this shot and a diverter sends the\\nball up a ramp at the top of the playfield and back to the left\\ninlane, where you have a shot at the right orbit to score\\ntriple the value of your left orbit shot.\\n\\nYour first shot at the combo is the only one that\\'s likely to be\\nworth much (200M).  The value just counts down too quickly.\\n\\nThis is a very nice Mission to start a ball off with if you can\\nshake the launched ball down the left orbit instead of into the\\ntop rollovers.\\n\\n CO2.  The CO2 level is going up, and you have to collect\\nfour items before the level reaches 20.  Collect an item\\nby hitting the Spinner.  The items are: 1 Sock (10M),\\n2 LCG Bags (20M), Red Suit Hoses (30M), and an Air Scubber (40M).\\nIf you get all four items, you collect a bonus, which is increased\\nby the bumpers during the mode.  The bonus is typically around 40M.\\n\\n MANUAL BURN.   The spacecraft is off course by 7 degrees.\\n3 shots are lit; either the Left Orbit, Spinner,\\nand Rocket Ramp, or the BLASTOFF Ramp, Right Orbit, and Right\\nSaucer.  One of the 3 shots is flashing.  The solidly-lit\\nshots move the spacecraft 1 or 2 degrees back on course, and\\nthe flashing shot moves it 3 degrees.\\n\\nIf one of the 3 shots puts the spacecraft back on course, it will\\nbe flashing.  Otherwise, the outermost shots will be flashing.\\n\\nEach shot is worth 50 + 10M to 90M until the mode ends, either by\\ngetting back on course or timing out.\\n\\nThis mode is worth a TON of points if you DON\\'T get the\\nspacecraft back on course.  I\\'ve gotten over 500M on\\nit before, and average about 250M.\\n\\n ROCKET 2-BALL.  a 2-ball where the only thing to hit is\\nthe Rocket Ramp.  It\\'s worth 10 - 20 - 30 - 40M to a max\\nof 50M.  It my be wisest to shoot for the bumpers\\nin this mode, depending on their value.\\n\\nThere\\'s a quirky series of words that go by on the display.\\nSome are jokes.  I \"get\" some of them, but not all.  Anyway,\\nthey\\'re...  INCO - FAO - NETWORK - RECOVERY - LBSTR - WRMSMG\\n- BOOSTER - RETRO - FIDO - GUIDANCE - SURGEON - ECOM - GNC\\n- TELMU - GTBY - CONTROL - RGP.  Thought you might be interested\\nin that... :)\\n\\n MOON\\'S GRAVITY.  The Blastoff ramp is lit for three shots of\\n20 - 30 - 40M (?), for a total of 100M.\\n\\n UNDER VOLT.  Another Mission that can be worth a -ton- of\\npoints.  The Battery targets are lit and the Under Volt value\\nstarts at 42M and starts counting down.  Hit a Battery target\\nto freeze the value and light all the major shots for that\\nvalue for 20 seconds.\\n\\nYou can hit a Battery target a second time to reset the timer\\nto 20 seconds and collect the point value.  But this can be\\ntough to do as often the ball hits a target a second time quickly\\nafter the first hit, effectively burning its worth.\\n\\n LIFE SUPPORT.  The Food and Water targets are hit for 20 - 30\\n- 40 - 50M.  After hitting one of them, the bottom post comes up for a few\\nseconds.  Completing the Mission earns you 150M and a shot\\nof Ed Harris barfing up his dinner.\\n\\n DOCKING.  Hit any target in the D-O-C-K bank four times to\\nget 10 - 20 - 30 - 40M and an extra ball.  I don\\'t think you\\nget the EB after the first time through the Missions.\\n\\n LITE EXTRA BALL.  Lights the right saucer for extra ball.\\n\\n MASTER ALARM.  This Wizard Mission is lit after the other 9 have been\\nplayed.  It\\'s a 40-second frenzy where every target scores 1M\\nand adds 1M to a Jackpot that is lit at the Blastoff ramp.\\nThe Jackpot does not reset after collecting it, and it doesn\\'t\\n(to my knowledge) have a limit.\\n\\nObviously, this round can be worth a ton of points if you\\nhave the ramp shot down.  \\n\\n\\nQUICK NOTE ON EXTRA BALLS\\n\\nThere are two possible Extra Balls that I\\'ve seen: from the Light Extra\\nBall Mission and from the Docking Mission.  My machine has a limit\\nof 2 Extra Balls per game.  This is probably the default setting.\\nAfter getting 2 EBs, you get 50M for any \"usual\" EB instead.\\n\\n\\nREGULAR MULTIBALL\\n\\nRegular (3-ball) multiball is started with a shot to the Rocket\\nwhen the LED reads 1 and BLASTOFF is not lit for 13-ball.\\n\\nAfter hitting the Rocket, 3 balls are launched, and the bottom\\npost comes up for about 7 seconds.  There is no ball saver.\\n4 Jackpots are lit: at the left orbit, the spinner lane, the right orbit, and\\nthe right saucer.  The value of the Jackpots seem to depend on\\nthe number of balls in play and number of switch closures during multiball,\\nand are typically in the 20-40M range.  Not particularly high.\\n\\nAfter getting all 4 Jackpots, a Super Jackpot (SJ) is lit at the\\nBlastoff ramp for 150M (?) for X seconds.  After collecting the SJ,\\nanother round of 3-ball multiball begins.\\n\\nThe SJ can also be lit by completing the M-O-O-N targets in sequence\\nduring multiball.\\n\\n\\n13-BALL\\n\\nWhen the 8 BLASTOFF letters (shown below the score display) are\\ncompleted (they then flash), the next multiball will be 13 BALL.\\n\\nThere are 4 ways of collecting letters:\\n\\n You get one at the start of a game for free.\\n  By hitting the Blastoff ramp when the yellow lamp is lit.  The\\nlamp is lit at the beginning of every ball.\\n  From a Mystery award.\\n  From a Blastoff ramp combo.  There are two of these, depending on what position\\nthe diverter is in: ramp -> ramp, or ramp -> left orbit -> ramp.  Any other switch\\nbreaks the combo.  Keep in mind that the ramp can be \"faked\" after a weak\\nshot that falls back down hits an inlane switch with its next shot.\\n\\n\\nWhen 13-ball starts, the bottom post raises and stays up for about\\n10 seconds.  Three or four balls are launched, and after about 5 seconds\\nthe 8 balls in the 8-ball holder are released, all at once.  There is no\\nball saver.\\n\\nDuring 13-ball, the Rocket is lit for Jackpots.  The Jackpot values seem\\nto be affected by the number of balls in play and the number of switch closures.\\nMy best guess is that the Jackpot = 10M * (balls in play) + 1M * (switch closures).\\nIn any case, they\\'re typically in the 100-250M range.\\n\\nAfter a Jackpot, the bottom post is NOT raised.  This is very important,\\nas the ball will most likely head STDM.

Introduction\\n\\nAttack From Mars is the latest in the line of pinball games from Williams.\\nIt features a nice open playfield, and easy to understand rules. The theme\\nis basically what it sounds, defending the Earth from attacking Martians.\\nThe credits for the game are as follows:\\n\\nDesign: Brian Eddy\\nSoftware: Lyman Sheats\\nArtwork: Doug Watson\\nMusic & Sounds: Dan Forden\\nMechanical Engineer: Robert C. Friesl\\nDots: Adam Rhine & Brian Morris\\n\\nBlatent Editorial - This is one of the best games to come out in a\\nLONG time.\\n\\n\\n2. Playfield Layout\\n\\nHere is the basic layout of the playfield starting just above the left outlane\\nand going clockwise around.\\n\\nMAR Targets - 3 targets of which are the first the letters of the word\\nmartian.\\n\\nLeft Orbit - Loops the ball up to the top rollovers and bumpers.  Lights a\\n\"capture\". If capture is complete, loops ball all the way\\naround.\\n\\nLeft Ramp - Sends ball back to left return lane.  Lights a \"Big-O-Beam\".\\n\\nMiddle Orbit - Locks ball when lock is lit. Otherwise sends ball back around\\nto right return lane and lights lock.\\n\\nT Target - 1 target which is the next letter in the word martian.\\n\\nFlying Saucer- The main toy in the game. Knock down the forcefield in front\\nof it to gain access to the three targets inside. Described\\nin more detail in the Attack Phase section.\\n\\nI Target - 1 target which is yet another letter in martian.\\n\\nScoop - Used to start Martian Attack, and Rule The Universe. Also\\nawards Stroke of Luck and Extra Ball when lit.\\n\\nUpper Lanes - Used for regular skill shot, also increase bonus x.\\n\\nBumpers - 3 bumpers.  Certain # of hits starts super jets.\\n\\nRight Ramp - Sends ball back to right return lane.  Lights a \"Tractor Beam\".\\n\\nRight Orbit - Sends ball up to the top rollovers.  Lights an \"Atomic Blaster\".\\nIf Atomic Blaster is complete, sends ball all the way around.\\n\\nAN Targets - 2 targets which are the last 2 letters in Martian.\\n\\n3. Skill Shot\\n\\nThe game has a fairly easy skill shot which simply involves you shooting the\\nball and then moving the flashing light to the correct rollever lane that the\\nball is going through. It awards a point value and gives +5x bonus.\\nThere is also a super skill shot which sends the ball around, down the left\\norbit. The game then gives the player a few seconds to hit any major shot,\\nwhich will score 50 million, plus complete whatever you hit. Therefore, if\\nyou hit the right ramp, you will get 50 million, and it will finish the\\ntractor beam. To activate the super skill shot, hold down the left flipper\\nwhen shooting the ball.\\n\\n4. Attack Phase\\n\\nThe Attack Phase is the heart and soul of the game. It involves the player\\nprotecting a certain country from the martians. The countries are France,\\nItaly, Germany, United States, & England. To start an attack phase, all 3\\ntargets which make up the force field in front of the flying saucer must be\\nhit. The forcefield will then lower opening up the 3 targets behind.  Here\\'s\\nan attempt at a diagram to better explain this.\\n\\n\\n          H              H = Hole\\n        / D \\\\            D = Drop Target\\n      /T     T\\\\          T = Side Targets\\n    /           \\\\        F = Targets on force field\\n      =========\\n      F   F   F\\n\\n\\nWhen the force field goes down, the attack phase starts. The object is then\\nto hit any of the targets inside. When a target is hit, it puts some damage\\non the attacking saucer and scores points. If more than one target is hit in\\na shot, it will multiply the damage and points by the number of hits (i.e. 2\\ntargets hit = 2X damage). When the saucer has taken enough damage, the drop\\ntarget in the back will stay down and a shot into the hole will destroy the\\nsaucer. The first saucer destroyed is worth 200 million, and goes up 100\\nmillion each time. This is not a timed mode, and will not end until the\\nsaucer is destroyed, not even if you lose your ball. The amount of hits\\nrequired to take a shot at destroying the saucer goes up each time.\\n\\nOnce you defend all of the countries, you steal one of the flying saucers\\nand start Attack Mars mode. First the force field must be knocked down, then\\nthe object is to hit the ball into the hole (the drop target will not come\\nback up). Every shot into the hole takes a chunk out of Mars and awards 50\\nmillion points. The 10th shot into the hole destroys Mars and awards 2.5\\nbillion points.\\n\\n5. Multiball\\n\\nThe middle orbit is used to light lock and to lock balls. If lock is not\\nlit, the ball will be sent back around to the right return lane and lock will\\nthen light. Hit the shot again and it will lock a ball.  Locking 3 balls\\nstarts multiball. In multiball, the left orbit, left ramp, middle orbit,\\nright ramp, and right orbit all light up for jackpots. Hit all of the\\njackpots to light super jackpot. The super jackpot starts at the left orbit,\\nand moves around every few of seconds. It moves to the different jackpot\\nshots back and forth across the playfield. Once the super jackpot is\\ncollected, it starts all over again. Multiball ends when less than 2 balls\\nare left. If Super Jackpot is lit when multiball ends, it will give you a\\n10 second countdown in which you can still collect the Super Jackpot. The\\ngame allows a pretty long \"grace\" period after multiball ends as well, meaning\\nthat remaining jackpots can still be collected after multiball ends. If you\\ndo finish off all of the jackpots after multiball ends, you still get the 10\\nsecond Super Jackpot countdown.\\n\\n6. Stroke of Luck\\n\\nStroke of luck is lit by lighting all of the lights in the outlanes and\\nreturn lanes (just like lighting Khan multiball in The Shadow). It is\\ncollected by shooting the scoop. It awards a random award by putting 4 on\\nthe screen and having a flying saucer shooting them away until one is left.\\nSome of the awards include multiball, strobe multiball, light EB, start\\nattack phase, light martian attack, points, bonus X, Video Mode & Sneak Attack.\\n\\nFeatures started only by Stroke of Luck:\\n\\n Video mode is like an old Apple ][ computer game called Sabotage. You\\ncontrol a cannon in the center and move it left and right (it is constantly\\nshooting). Your goal is to shoot the flying saucers that are trying to land.\\nYou get points for every saucer you shoot, and the mode ends when a saucer\\nreaches the ground. Once per video mode, the launch button can be pressed\\nand will destroy all of the saucers on the screen. This is useful for when\\na saucer is about to hit the ground and it is too late to shoot it. After\\n30 saucers are destroyed, an Extra Ball pod is sent down, shooting it awards\\nan Extra Ball. After all of the saucers are destroyed (40 or 50 of them),\\nthe mothership comes down. It moves left and right trying to avoid your\\ncannon fire. Hitting it 80 times destroys it.  Finishing video mode gives\\na total of around 635 million points. There is also a way to turn the flying\\nsaucers into cows! To do it you have to get the cow off of the big-o-beam and\\nthe tractor beam and while it is showing the animation of the cow hit the launch\\nbutton (you will hear a strange noise if you do it right). If you get video mode\\nafter doing this it will change video mode into a sort of \"Attack From the Pasture!\"\\n Strobe Multiball is one of the coolest things in the game. When this starts,\\neverything that was going on in the game stops. The force field comes up (if\\nit was down) and all of the lights shut off. A strobe light by the flying\\nsaucer then starts flashing, and this is the only light coming from the game.\\n3 balls are then kicked out, and the object is to hit the force field as many\\ntimes as as possible. The game awards 50 million per hit, and awards a bonus\\nafter a certain number of hits (Light EB at 10 hits, 250 million at 20).\\nThis ends when less than 2 balls are left, and the game goes back to what was\\ngoing on before this started. An interesting note about this is that because\\nof the Strobe Multiball, this is the first pinball game to come with an\\nEpilepsy warning on it.\\n Sneak Attack lights one of the martian target banks up at random. A hurry\\nup value starts at 150 million and counts down. If you hit the lit target\\nbank, it awards the value, gives you 2 martian bombs, and lights Martian\\nAttack.\\n\\n\\n7. Total Annihilation\\n\\nTotal Annihilation involves collecting the awards from the orbits and ramps.\\nThe left orbit is Capture, the left ramp is the Big-O-Beam, the right ramp\\nis the Tractor Beam, and the right orbit is the Atomic Blaster. It takes\\n3 shots to complete one of these, unless you complete it using the super\\nskill shot. Once one of them is completed, it starts a hurry-up in which\\nthe flying saucer (inner targets or force field) starts at 100 million and\\ncounts down. If you finish another one of the ramp/loop awards while the\\nother one is counting down, the hurry up will reset at a higher point value.\\nIf all 4 awards are completed during the countdown, the game will award 1\\nbillion points.\\n\\nOnce you complete all 4 things, Total Annihilation starts. It is a 4 ball\\nmultiball in which every major shot awards the Annihilation value. The lock\\nshot awards an Annihilation jackpot, which is increased by hitting the other\\nshots. Therefore, if you collect a lot of annihilation values, you get the\\npoints for hitting it and they are also put into the jackpot making it worth\\nquite a large amount. Once the jackpot is collected it resets back down to\\nit\\'s base value an can be built up again.\\n\\n8. Martian Attack\\n\\nMartian Attack is lit by hitting all of the martian targets (or can be lit\\nby Stroke of Luck). It is collected by hitting the scoop.  Once started, all\\n4 martians must be hit within a time limit. The martians are above each of\\nthe 4 martian target banks (They start dancing around when this mode starts\\nlike the Boogie Men in Elvira). To hit them, just hit a target in the target\\nbank below them. If Stroke of Luck gave you a martian bomb, you can hit the\\nlaunch button and it will award you one of the martians. Once you hit all\\n4 martians, Martian 2-ball starts. During this you just want to hit the\\nmartian targets as many times as possible. Each hit is worth 20 million, but\\ncan be increased if you hit all of martian targets again while Martian Attack\\nis lit. 2-ball ends when 1 ball drains.  The game records how many martians\\nyou killed during this, and there is a listing on the high score table for\\nthe person who killed the most.\\n\\n9. Rule The Universe\\n\\nRule The Universe is the \"wizard\" award in the game. It is a pretty hard\\nthing to achieve. To get it, the following things have to have been done:\\n\\n At least 1 Super Jackpot must have been collected during multiball.\\n Super Jets must have been started at one point during the game.\\n Martian Attack multiball has to have been started.\\n Total Annihilation must have been played.\\n Mars has to have been conquered in the Mars Attack phase.\\n 5-way combo must have been done.\\n\\n\\nWhen Rule The Universe is started, everything becomes lit. Total Annihilation\\nstarts up, the martian targets are worth 50 million, pretty much everything awards\\npoints. You get a multiball with the ball saver lit for awhile.  The object is to\\ncollect 5 billion points while multiball is still going. Once the 5 billion points\\nhave been collected, everything stops. The game awards you an extra 5 billion\\npoints as well as putting your name in the high score list as the last person to\\nrule.\\n\\n10. Misc\\n\\n\\n One of the best things about this game is that features don\\'t end when\\nsomething else is started up. If you have an Attack Phase going and you\\nstart multiball, it keeps going. Very good idea.  Many things can be going\\non at once.\\n Cows are present in this game. Sometimes when you hit the Big-O-Beam, a\\ncow is enlarged and the lady says \"Would you look at the size of that cow?!\"\\nand it moos. The cow is sometimes tractor beamed up as well.  There is also\\na picture of a cow on the right ramp.\\n Once Rule the Universe has been played once, you don\\'t have to conquer mars\\nagain in order to light Rule the Universe again (but you do have to do all\\nof the other things).\\n Bonus can be very big in this game. I\\'ve seen bonus multipliers as large as\\n42X! Awarded almost 4 billion just in bonus!\\n\\n\\n11.

Gottlieb & Co., released in 1971, how does the scoring system for the pop bumpers work, and how does their lighting condition affect their score value?', 'answer': 'In \"4 Square,\" the left and right pop bumpers score 1 point when unlit and 10 points when lit. The central pop bumper scores 10 points when unlit and 100 points when lit. The three bumpers never all light up at the same time. They alternate between having both 10 point bumpers lit and the 100 point bumper out, or the 100 point bumper lit and both 10 point bumpers out. This alternation occurs when 1 point is scored, either by hitting a kicking rubber or when either 10 point bumper is hit while not lit. Once the 10 point bumpers are lit, all three bumpers score 10 points, and none of the bumpers can cause the lights to alternate again. In this situation, a player must hit a kicking rubber to switch the bumper lights back, lighting up the 100 point bumper and turning off the 10 point bumpers.'}}, {'qa_pairs': {'query': 'In the Addams Family pinball game, what is the initial jackpot value during Multi-Ball(TM) and how can it be increased to its maximum value?', 'answer': 'The initial jackpot value during Multi-Ball(TM) is 10M.

It is a hurry-up shot that counts down very slowly, allowing the player to collect it without rushing. If the player successfully collects it before losing the ball, they can earn a potentially large score, which can exceed 400M in a long game. If not collected, it resets to 20M.'}}, {'qa_pairs': {'query': 'In the \"Attack From Mars\" pinball game, what is the primary objective during the Attack Phase, and how does the player achieve it?', 'answer': 'The primary objective during the Attack Phase is to protect a certain country from the Martians by hitting all 3 targets which make up the force field in front of the flying saucer to lower it, thereby opening up the 3 targets behind it. The player must then hit any of these targets to damage the attacking saucer and score points. The phase is completed by causing enough damage to the saucer so that the drop target in the back stays down, allowing a shot into the hole to destroy the saucer.'}}]\n"
