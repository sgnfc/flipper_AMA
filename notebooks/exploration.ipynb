       " Document(page_content=\"Here is my post from last time - https://www.reddit.com/r/pinball/s/0T7rmfLg5e\\n\\nSince last year I learned about pinball and read a graphic novel about pinball but I didn't get to play at all! I've had this event circled on my calendar for a whole year and just couldn't wait. I went today for about eight hours and had the time of my life!\\n\\nHere are some observations -\\n\\n1. Ear protection was a game changer this year! I wish Id have had noise cancelling headphones instead of ear plugs, so that's an upgrade I need to make for next time.\\n\\n2. I attended some seminars this time and I am still amazed by how intricate pinball machines are and what it takes to build them. Pinball doesn't seem like a way to get rich so really this industry just seems built for love. It reminds me a lot of like a train show where these people sell train affiliated stuff but like no one is making money. The talks were way over my head but everyone was so fascinated.\\n\\n3. I think this year had better organization. It seemed like I never quite so everything, I walked several miles while I was there according to FitBit and there was just something new around every corner. Also the lobby was much better organized this year in my opinion. The organizers of this event know what they're doing.\\n\\n4. I'm again so impressed by just how nice everyone is! It's like a big birthday party or something. The makers of the games talked to me, people played multiplayer with me, talked shop, and even cheered for me. People were just so polite and interested. Really great social skills. It made a huge difference for me because I went alone again.\\n\\n5. I knew a little more this year and I knew some games and it was more fun this year than last year and I didn't think that would be possible. I understood a little of the history and I played some historical games, some 90s games, and some brand new ones. I think the more you know and understand the more fun the games are.\\n\\n6. Watching the tournaments was very exciting!! You people are like wildly talented and also humble. No huge egos or rage quitting or something, just like respect and appreciation. One guy who plays tournaments played Jaws with me and this guy blew my mind and as a beginner it was equally fun watching him as playing myself. I don't think eSports are nearly as engaging to watch and if never seen a tournament before so even as a first time spectator it was incredible.\\n\\nAnyway, feel free to ask me anything, here is a list of every game I played:\\n\\nLooney Tunes\\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre\\nHalloween \\nBobby Orr Power Play\\nHoudini\\nIndiana Jones\\nJaws (both editions)\\nLabyrinth\\nJurassic Park (new)\\nBig Game\\nWeird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity\\nHot Wheels\\nFish Tales\\nThe Who's Tommy (with Pinsound)\\nCinderella (one of the first games to ever have flippers)\\nPulp Fiction\\nElton John\\nScooby Doo\\nSafe Cracker (I won!)\\nCactus Canyon\\nCow Poke\\n\\nHad the time of my life, was very sad to leave, will absolutely be back next year!\\n\\nAsk me anything!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", metadata={'post_subreddit': 'r/pinball', 'post_category': 'new', 'post_title': \"Last year I attended TPF for the first time having never played pinball and y'all liked my observations.

I've had this event circled on my calendar for a whole year and just couldn't wait. I went today for about eight hours and had the time of my life!\\n\\nHere are some observations -\\n\\n1. Ear protection was a game changer this year! I wish Id have had noise cancelling headphones instead of ear plugs, so that's an upgrade I need to make for next time.\\n\\n2. I attended some seminars this time and I am still amazed by how intricate pinball machines are and what it takes to build them. Pinball doesn't seem like a way to get rich so really this industry just seems built for love. It reminds me a lot of like a train show where these people sell train affiliated stuff but like no one is making money. The talks were way over my head but everyone was so fascinated.\\n\\n3. I think this year had better organization. It seemed like I never quite so everything, I walked several miles while I was there according to FitBit and there was just something new around every corner. Also the lobby was much better organized this year in my opinion. The organizers of this event know what they're doing.\\n\\n4. I'm again so impressed by just how nice everyone is! It's like a big birthday party or something. The makers of the games talked to me, people played multiplayer with me, talked shop, and even cheered for me. People were just so polite and interested. Really great social skills. It made a huge difference for me because I went alone again.\\n\\n5. I knew a little more this year and I knew some games and it was more fun this year than last year and I didn't think that would be possible. I understood a little of the history and I played some historical games, some 90s games, and some brand new ones. I think the more you know and understand the more fun the games are.\\n\\n6. Watching the tournaments was very exciting!! You people are like wildly talented and also humble. No huge egos or rage quitting or something, just like respect and appreciation. One guy who plays tournaments played Jaws with me and this guy blew my mind and as a beginner it was equally fun watching him as playing myself. I don't think eSports are nearly as engaging to watch and if never seen a tournament before so even as a first time spectator it was incredible.\\n\\nAnyway, feel free to ask me anything, here is a list of every game I played:\\n\\nLooney Tunes\\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre\\nHalloween \\nBobby Orr Power Play\\nHoudini\\nIndiana Jones\\nJaws (both editions)\\nLabyrinth\\nJurassic Park (new)\\nBig Game\\nWeird Al's Museum of Natural Hilarity\\nHot Wheels\\nFish Tales\\nThe Who's Tommy (with Pinsound)\\nCinderella (one of the first games to ever have flippers)\\nPulp Fiction\\nElton John\\nScooby Doo\\nSafe Cracker (I won!)\\nCactus Canyon\\nCow Poke\\n\\nHad the time of my life, was very sad to leave, will absolutely be back next year!\\n\\nAsk me anything!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", metadata={'post_subreddit': 'r/pinball', 'post_category': 'hot', 'post_title': \"Last year I attended TPF for the first time having never played pinball and y'all liked my observations.

Thought it was a misprint or a scam, but replied anyway. 30 minutes later got a response and Sunday at 10 AM, I was the owner! Was told it powers on but has a sticking relay, but I don\\'t care - for $100, it\\'s worth it just as a time capsule.Of course I will try to get it running but no rush.\\n\\nI currently have 4 other EMs and two SS machines, but honestly this Victory Special is in the best condition of ANY of my machines. This thing is in phenomenal shape! The design is very unique and the playfield and back glass are literally absolutely perfect. Even the original paper instruction cards are still there and in almost perfect condition. \\n\\nIt is a nickel machine, and the original coin mech looks like new old stock! It\\'s really pretty amazing. With a production date of 5/29/46, this thing is coming up on 78 years old, and except for normal wear and tear to the cabinet, it looks almost brand new!\\n\\nTo top it off, when I moved it, I had to tilt it to get it out of the truck, and a whole bunch of stuff was clanking around inside. When I cleaned it out, I found 4 pinballs - 2 smaller than normal size (1.02\") and 2 larger than normal (1.21\"). I have never seen either size before, and it makes me wonder why there were two sizes, and what size this machine \"should\" use?\\n\\nLastly, in what was the coolest find of all, I found a coin that had obviously been hiding in the machine for a long time that tipping it up to unload it had dislodged - a nickel from the year it was made - 1946! It will now live inside the machine, on the apron forever...', metadata={'post_subreddit': 'r/pinball', 'post_category': 'hot', 'post_title': 'Picked up a 1946 Bally Victory Special', 'post_score': 52, 'post_id': '1bdl278', 'post_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bdl278', 'post_author': Redditor(name='wottenad')}),\n",

The\\njackpot starts at 10M.  Each shot to the Helipad to increase the jackpot adds\\n30M, and collecting a jackpot makes the next jackpot double the value of the\\none just collected.
